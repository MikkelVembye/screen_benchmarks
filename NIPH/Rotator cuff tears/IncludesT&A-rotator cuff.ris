AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether an association exists between preoperative shoulder injections and reoperations in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (aRCR). METHODS: The PearlDiver Patient Records Database was reviewed for Humana-insured patients undergoing aRCR after a shoulder injection. Two matched groups were created: aRCR within 1 year of injection (n = 12,054) and aRCR without prior injection within 1 year of surgery (n = 12,054). Reoperation rates within 3 months, at 3 to 6 months, and at 6 to 12 months postoperatively were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed with the chi-square test. RESULTS: The rate of reoperation within 3 months of the index procedure was higher in the control group (3.7% vs 3.1%, P = .01); however, 3 to 6 months after the index procedure, the rate of reoperation was higher in patients who received an injection within 1 year of the index procedure (1.8% vs 1.4%, P = .03). During the same intervals, the rate of revision rotator cuff repair (RCR) within 3 months of the index procedure was higher in the control group (2.9% vs 2.6%) and the rate of revision RCR 3 to 6 months after the index procedure was higher in patients who received an injection within 1 year of the index procedure (1.1% vs 0.9%); however, these results were not statistically significant (P = .3 and P = .8, respectively). The incidence of revision RCR (1.6% vs 1.1%; odds ratio, 1.4; P = .003) and incidence of subacromial decompression (1.5% vs 1.1%; odds ratio, 1.3; P = .01) 6 to 12 months after the index procedure were significantly higher in patients receiving an injection within 1 year before surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative shoulder injections may increase the risk of revision RCR and subacromial decompression by up to 150% in patients 6 to 12 months after index surgery compared with patients who did not receive a preoperative injection. However, the absolute increase in these revision procedures is only 0.5%. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative study.

AB  - Background: Operative time is a risk factor for short-term complications after orthopaedic procedures; however, it has yet to be investigated as an independent risk factor for postoperative complications after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Purpose: To determine whether operative time is an independent risk factor for complications, readmissions, and extended hospital stays within 30 days after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was queried for all hospital-based inpatient and outpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs (Current Procedural Terminology code 29827) from 2005 to 2016. Concomitant procedures such as subacromial decompression, biceps tenodesis, superior labrum anterior and posterior (SLAP) repair, labral repair, and distal clavicle excision were also included, whereas patients undergoing arthroplasty were excluded from the study. Operative time was correlated with patient demographics, comorbidities, and concomitant procedures. All adverse events were correlated with operative time, while controlling for the above preoperative variables, using multivariate Poisson regression with a robust error variance. Results: A total of 27,524 procedures met inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age of patients was 58.4 +/- 10.9 years, the mean operative time was 86.9 +/- 37.4 minutes, and the mean body mass index was 30.4 +/- 7.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Concomitant biceps tenodesis, glenohumeral debridement, SLAP repair, labral repair, and distal clavicle excision significantly increased operative time (P < .001) but not the risk of adverse events (P > .05). The overall rate of adverse events was 0.88%. After adjusting for demographic and procedural characteristics, a 15-minute increase in operative duration was associated with an increased risk of anemia requiring transfusion (relative risk [RR], 1.27 [95% CI, 1.14-1.42]; P < .001), venous thromboembolism (RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.02-1.35]; P = .029), surgical site infection (RR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.03-1.24]; P = .011), and extended length of hospital stay (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.14]; P = .036). Conclusion: Although the rate of short-term complications after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is low, incremental increases in operative time are associated with an increased risk of adverse events such as surgical site infection, pulmonary embolism, transfusion, and extended length of hospital stay. Efforts should be made to maximize surgical efficiency in the operating room through optimal coordination of the staff or increased preoperative planning.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although good short-term and mid-term outcomes are reported for rotator cuff repair, few studies have investigated long-term outcome with clinical and MRI evaluation. The hypothesis was that 10 years following repair of rotator cuff tear, the clinical and anatomic results depend on the extension of the tear. METHODS: The records of all 965 patients who underwent repair of rotator cuff tears in 2003 were retrieved. The patients were reviewed in 2014 for evaluation at a minimum follow-up of 10 years. A total of 511 patients were evaluated clinically, of whom 397 were also evaluated using MRI. There were 289 isolated supraspinatus tears (SS), 94 tears with posterior extension (P), 92 with anterior extension (A) and 36 with anteroposterior (AP) extension. RESULTS: The Constant score had significantly improved from 53.8 +/- 14.7 preoperatively to 77.7 +/- 12.1 (P < 0.0001) at 10 years, with no significant difference between the four groups. The rate of retear (Sugaya IV, V) was lower in the SS group (19%) and higher in the P (32%) and AP groups (31%). At review, infraspinatus fatty degeneration was significantly greater (Fuchs > 2) in the P (P < 0.001) and AP (P < 0.001) groups and subscapularis fatty degeneration was significantly greater (Fuchs > 2) in the A (P < 0.001) and AP (P < 0.001) groups. The rate of osteoarthritis (Samilson > 2) was significantly higher at 11% (P = 0.001) in the A group. The failure rate was significantly lower (P = 0.044) in the SS group (25%) than the massive rotator cuff tear groups (A, P and AP groups) (35%). Complications occurred in 51 shoulders (10%) and repeat surgery was required in 62 shoulders (12%), with no difference between the four groups. CONCLUSIONS: The long follow-up period of this study, large series of patients and MRI evaluation of tendon repair allowed us to demonstrate that 10 years following rotator cuff tear repair, between 68 and 81% of tendons had healed. These findings are of value in predicting response to surgical treatment. Tears with posterior extension had a higher risk of retear. However, surgical repair appeared to give a good functional outcome whatever the type of tear, despite the overall rate of complications and repeat surgery. Level of evidence: Iv.

AB  - Background: Surgical repair of rotator cuff (RC) tears is an effective treatment option. However, the prevalence of recurrent ruptures is high. Hypothesis: Recurrent tears are a frequent complication of surgical repair of RC tears. Their incidence might be influenced by factors such as the patient's age and size of the initial tear. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Data from 90 adult patients who underwent arthroscopic RC repair between 2014 and 2017 and underwent an ultrasound examination 6 to 12 months after surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Massive tears were repaired using a double-row technique, and nonmassive tears were repaired with a single-row technique. Clinical records were reviewed for demographic information. Results: All patients (57.8% women; 42.2% men) were older than 18 years (mean, 58.9 years). Of these patients, 30.0% (27/90) had massive tears, which were primarily found in patients >=60 years (74.1%; 20/27). Complete healing was seen in 74.5% of all repairs during follow-up. A total of 23 patients (25.5%) had retears (13 complete; 10 partial), which were diagnosed by ultrasound imaging 6 to 12 months after the initial surgery. The occurrence of retears was more prevalent in patients with massive tears than in patients with nonmassive tears (40.7% vs 19.0%, respectively); the difference was statistically significant (P = .03). Reruptures occurred in 50.0% of patients older than 60 years with massive tears. Although patients older than 60 years had more recurrent tears (32.6%) compared with younger patients (18.2%), the difference was not statistically significant (P = .12). Conclusion: One-quarter of the patients who had undergone surgical repair of an RC tear had recurrent ruptures. There was a statistically significant association between the initial massive tear and a retear. Patients older than 60 years showed a higher recurrence rate, but this difference lacked statistical significance. Reruptures occurred in 50.0% of patients older than 60 years with massive tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine when cuff re-tear commonly occurs in the postoperative period and to investigate the clinical factors that might predispose to an early cuff re-tear. METHODS: All patients with rotator cuff (supraspinatus +/- infraspinatus) tear that required arthroscopic repair during the period between June 1, 2010, and May 31, 2012, with completed serial ultrasound examinations at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 26 weeks postoperatively were included. Intraoperative findings were noted. Functional clinical outcomes were assessed by Constant score, Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index, and Oxford score. Compliance of patients with postoperative rehabilitation was established. RESULTS: There were 127 cases; the mean age of patients was 60 years. Overall re-tear rate was 29.1%. The percentage of new re-tears was significantly higher in the first 12 weeks than in the second 12 weeks postoperatively (25.2% and 3.9%, respectively). The patient's postoperative compliance was a significant prognostic factor for re-tearing. Significant associations were also found between re-tear and primary tear size, tendon quality, repair tension, cuff retraction, and footprint coverage. Poor compliance of patients was highest (17.3%) during the second 6 weeks postoperatively. Better functional outcomes were noted in patients who had re-torn their cuffs at the 12-week period (Oxford mean scores, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding of the predisposing factors will assist in predicting the prognosis of the repaired rotator cuff. Despite the progress of patients' functions postoperatively, an early significant improvement of the clinical outcome should be a warning sign to a surgeon that the patient's compliance may be suboptimal, resulting in an increased risk of the cuff's re-tearing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the relation between tendon integrity and functional results following the arthroscopic treatment of small- and medium-sized rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Arthroscopic repair was performed on 26 consecutive patients (21 women, 5 men;mean age: 55.9 years; range: 33-72 years) with small- and medium-sized tears of the supraspinatus tendon. Patients were postoperatively evaluated at 12 and 24 months using the Constant and UCLA functional outcome scores and ultrasound examinations. RESULTS: The supraspinatus tendon did not heal in nine patients (34.6%) and was partially healed in three (11%), 12 months after surgery. Mean postoperative Constant and UCLA scores of these patients were 73.1 and 27.8, respectively, which were not significantly different from those with an intact tendon on the final follow-up (Constant: 78 and UCLA: 30; p=0.107 and p=0.164). Both rating systems reflected significant improvement with treatment (p<0.01). The mean age of patients with a re-tear was 66.8 years, which was significantly higher than those with an intact repair (54 years; p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The arthroscopic repair of small and medium-sized supraspinatus tendon tears yields good long-term results independent of tendon integrity. Healing potential may be decreased with increased age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears is a common procedure performed by orthopedic surgeons. There is a well-known incidence of up to 35% of bilateral rotator cuff tear disease in patients who have a known unilateral tear. The majority of the literature focuses on outcomes after unilateral surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine if there are clinical differences in shoulders of patients who underwent staged bilateral rotator cuff repairs during their lifetime. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent staged bilateral arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery at our institution was performed. All patients had at least 2 years of follow-up. Clinical outcome scores including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and Rowe measures were obtained. A subset of patients returned for clinical and ultrasound evaluation performed by an independent fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologist. RESULTS: Overall, 110 shoulders in 55 patients, representing 68% of all eligible patients, participated. No clinical or statistical difference was found in any outcome measure. ASES scores averaged 86.5 (36.7-100) in the dominant shoulder compared with 89.6 (23.3-100) in the nondominant shoulder (P = .42). Ultrasound was available on 34 shoulders and showed complete healing rate of 88%. The shoulders with retearing of the rotator cuff (12%) demonstrated clinically relevant lower ASES scores (72.5) compared with shoulders with confirmed healed repairs (86.2; P = .2). DISCUSSION: Patients who undergo staged bilateral rotator cuff repair can expect to have similarly good clinical outcomes regardless of hand dominance or chronologic incidence with excellent healing rates in both shoulders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperlipidemia is linked to poor tendon-to-bone healing and progression of fatty infiltration after rotator cuff repair. Statins effectively treat hyperlipidemia, but it is unknown if they have any potential detrimental effects following rotator cuff repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of statins on rotator cuff healing and fatty infiltration following repair. METHODS: A total of 77 patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were recruited prospectively, 38 patients who were prescribed a statin for hyperlipidemia (statin group) and 39 patients who were not taking a statin (control group). Patients who did not have both preoperative and 1-year postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were excluded from the study. Patient-reported outcome measures, namely the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index, Constant-Murley score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, were collected preoperatively and at 1 year. Fatty infiltration was assessed on MRI according to the Goutallier grade preoperatively and at 12 months; rotator cuff healing was assessed at 12 months according to the Sugaya classification. Following propensity score weighting to adjust for baseline imbalances, 12-month outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: At 12 months, all patient-reported outcome measures had improved significantly compared with baseline (WORC score, 85.9 vs. 32.5, P < .001; ASES score, 87.3 vs. 37.5, P < .001; Constant-Murley score, 77 vs. 31, P < .001; and DASH score, 13.6 vs. 61.4, P < .001). There was no significant difference in postoperative scores in the statin group vs. the control group (WORC score, 84.9 vs. 89.6, P = .94; ASES score, 87.5 vs. 86.6, P = .40; Constant-Murley score, 77 vs. 81, P = .90; and DASH score, 14.4 vs. 11.4, P = .14), and for 3 of these scores, the 95% confidence intervals excluded a clinically meaningful difference. Similarly, rotator cuff healing at 12 months and Goutallier fatty infiltration grades were comparable between the 2 groups. Retears were seen in 6 patients (15.8%) in the statin group and 8 (20.5%) in the control group. Progression of fatty infiltration was seen in 4 patients (10.5%) in the statin and 4 (10.3%) in the control group. Statin use did not demonstrate a significant association with either retear risk (P = .41) or progression of fatty atrophy (P = .69). CONCLUSION: Patient-reported outcomes, rotator cuff retear rate, and fatty infiltration on MRI at 12 months after rotator cuff repair in patients with hyperlipidemia treated with statins are similar to those in a control group.

AB  - Outcomes after rotator cuff repair (RCR) typically are poorer for workers' compensation (WC) than for patients with private insurance. This study examined augmentation of the traditional rehabilitation protocol with an online exercise program. Between March 2016 and July 2018, 48 WC patients who underwent RCR were introduced to a digital rehabilitation program (application). Patients were divided into patients who used the application along with traditional physical therapy (PT) (group 1) and patients who underwent only traditional PT (group 2). Patient performance was assessed using standardized patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), return-to-work (RTW) status, number of PT sessions, and complication/revision rate. Patients were monitored for a minimum of 1 year postoperatively. A significant improvement in RTW period was noted for group 1 patients, who resumed modified duty 10 weeks earlier than group 2 patients. A positive trend also was noted for return to full duty, with group 1 resuming full duty 7 weeks before group 2. There were no complications or reoperations in group 1 compared with 4 (16%) complications in group 2. The 2 groups underwent the same average number of PT sessions (27 sessions). Patient-reported outcome measures were captured only for group 1, which demonstrated average postoperative improvement of 3 points on a visual analog scale and 32.5 points in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores. Incorporating an online exercise program within the traditional rehabilitation protocol for WC patients undergoing RCR resulted in earlier return to work and was associated with better pain relief, greater return of function, and lower complication rate.

AB  - Introduction: Rehabilitation programs after rotator cuff repair should allow recovery of shoulder function without preventing tendon healing. The aim of this randomized prospective study was to compare the clinical results after two types of postoperative management: immediate passive motion versus immobilization. Patients and Methods: We followed 100 patients, mean age 55. years old, who underwent arthroscopic repair of a non-retracted supraspinatus tear. Patients were randomized to receive postoperative management of immediate passive motion or strict immobilization for 6. weeks. A clinical evaluation was performed in 92 patients, and CT arthrography in 82. Mean follow-up was 15. months. Result(s): The mean preoperative Constant score improved significantly from 46.1 points to 73.9 at the final follow-up. The rate of intact cuffs was 58.5%. Functional results were statistically better after immediate passive motion with a mean passive external rotation of 58.7degree at the final follow-up versus 49.1degree after immobilization (P= 0.011), a passive anterior elevation of 172.4degree versus 163.3degree (P= 0.094) respectively, a Constant score of 77.6 points versus 69.7 (P= 0.045) respectively, and a lower rate of adhesive capsulitis and complex regional pain syndrome. Results for healing seemed to be slightly better with immobilization, but this was not statistically significant: the cuff had a normal appearance in 35.9% of cases after immobilization compared to 25.6% after passive motion, an image of intratendinous addition was found in 25.6% versus 30.2%, punctiform leaks in 23.1% versus 20.9%, and recurrent tears in 15.4% versus 23.3% respectively. Discussion(s): The rehabilitation program that results in better tendon healing by preventing postoperative stiffness has not yet been identified. Our results suggest that early passive motion should be authorized: the functional results were better with no significant difference in healing. Level of Evidence: Level II.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection after rotator cuff repair (RCR) is uncommon. There are few reports in the literature regarding the management and long-term results of patients in whom deep infection of the shoulder develops after RCR. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term clinical and radiologic outcomes of these patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 764 patients after mini-open RCR in which 9 patients had postoperative infection. The demographic data, clinical and laboratory findings, risk factors, bacteriologic findings, and results of surgical management were analyzed. All patients underwent clinical and radiologic assessment at long-term follow-up of approximately 10 years after infection. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 56.2 years. The mean time to presentation for infection after RCR was 16 days. All patients had pain on presentation, and 6 patients had persistent discharge from their wounds with erythema. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus. At final follow-up at a mean of 11.62 years after surgery, the mean Simple Shoulder Test score was 10.5 and the mean Constant score was 70. The rotator cuff was intact in 5 of 7 patients. CONCLUSION: With appropriate treatment, eradication of infection can be achieved, and in appropriate cases, anchors can be retained. Reasonable long-term functional outcome scores can be achieved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this retrospective study was to report on the functional outcome after both open and arthroscopic rotator cuff (RC) repair in normal weight, pre-obese and obese patients. It was hypothesized that obesity is a negative prognostic factor for clinical outcome and failure for the RC repair. METHODS: One hundred and forty-six patients who underwent either open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between 2006 and 2010 were included in this study. Seventy-five patients (56.7 +/- 10.1 years of age) after open RC repair and 71 patients (59.0 +/- 9.1 years of age) treated arthroscopically were available for evaluation. In both groups a double-row reconstruction was performed. Patients were divided in three groups according to their body-mass index. The mean follow-up was at 43 +/- 16 (minimum 24) months. At follow-up, the clinical outcome was assessed by the DASH and Constant score. An ultrasound of both shoulders was performed in all patients. RESULTS: The mean BMI was 28.3 +/- 5.3 in the arthroscopic group and 27.7 +/- 4.3 in the open group. Overall, in both groups similar clinical results were noted [Constant-Murley score 78.3 +/- 18.2 arthroscopic vs. 77.0 +/- 21.8 for open surgery; DASH 12.7 +/- 18.2 arthroscopic vs. 15.6 +/- 21.6 for open surgery (p = 0.81)]. Both the failure rate and the clinical outcome were significantly worse for obese patients (BMI > 30, p = 0.007). The failure rate was 15.8% for the normal-weight patients, 8.2% in the pre-obese group and in the obese group 28.6%. The RC repair failure occurred in 11 cases in both groups after arthroscopic or open treatment (15.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Both the arthroscopic and the open approach showed equivalent clinical results and failure rates. Obesity (BMI > 30) causes less favorable results in the Constant and DASH scores and showed higher re-tear rates.

AB  - Rotator cuff repair (RCR) is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in orthopaedic surgery. The reported incidence of deep soft-tissue infections after RCR ranges between 0.3% and 1.9%. Deep shoulder infection after RCR appears uncommon, but the actual incidence may be higher as many cases may go unreported. Clinical presentation may include increasing shoulder pain and stiffness, high temperature, local erythema, swelling, warmth, and fibrinous exudate. Generalized fatigue and signs of sepsis may be present in severe cases. Varying clinical presentation coupled with a low index of suspicion may result in delayed diagnosis. Laboratory findings include high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, and, rarely, abnormal peripheral blood leucocyte count. Aspiration of glenohumeral joint synovial fluid with analysis of cell count, gram staining and culture should be performed in all patients suspected with deep shoulder infection after RCR. The most commonly isolated pathogens are Propionibacterium acnes , Staphylococcus epidermidis , and Staphylococcus aureus . Management of a deep soft-tissue infection of the shoulder after RCR involves surgical debridement with lavage and long-term intravenous antibiotic treatment based on the pathogen identified. Although deep shoulder infection after RCR is usually successfully treated, complications of this condition can be devastating. Prolonged course of intravenous antibiotic treatment, extensive soft-tissue destruction and adhesions may result in substantially diminished functional outcomes. © The Author(s) 2017.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of deep shoulder infections after RCR on patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted involving all patients with deep shoulder infections after arthroscopic RCR (study group). Another group of patients who were matched with the study group by age, gender and rotator cuff tear size, and did not develop deep shoulder infections after arthroscopic RCR was randomly identified (control group). The two groups were compared in terms of time to start physiotherapy, shoulder function, and delay in return to work. Results: There were 10 patients in each group. The mean time to start physiotherapy after surgery was 145.3 (SD=158.8) days for the study group and 40.0 (SD=13.7) days for the control group (p=.051). The average forward elevation of the operated shoulder was 133 (SD=33.4) degrees for the study group, and 172 (SD=12.0) degrees for the control group (p=0.003). The average time to return to work at pre-operative level was 5.6 months for the study group and 3 months for the control group. Conclusions: Deep shoulder infections after RCR significantly impedes time to start physiotherapy, shoulder function, and patients’ ability to return to work.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the clinical and structural outcomes after arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears of all sizes with a modified tension band suture technique. METHODS: Among 63 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear with the modified tension band suture technique at a single hospital between July 2011 and March 2013, 47 were enrolled in this study. The mean follow-up period was 29 months. Visual analog scale scores, range of motion, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores, Constant scores, and Shoulder Strength Index were measured preoperatively and at the final follow-up. For radiologic evaluation, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging 6 months postoperatively and ultrasonography at the final follow-up. We allocated the small and medium tears to group A and the large and massive tears to group B and then compared clinical outcomes and repair integrity. RESULTS: Postoperative clinical outcomes at the final follow-up showed significant improvements compared with those seen during preoperative evaluations (P < .001). However, group B showed worse clinical results than group A. Evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging performed 6 months postoperatively and ultrasonography taken at the final follow-up revealed that group B showed a significantly higher retear rate than did group A (69% vs. 6%, respectively; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair with the modified tension band suture technique for rotator cuff tears was a more suitable method for small to medium tears than for large to massive tears.

AB  - PURPOSE: To provide a comparative 30-day postoperative analysis of complications and unplanned readmission rates, using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, after open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was reviewed for postoperative complications after open or arthroscopic RCR over an 8-year period, from 2007 through 2014. Patients were identified by use of Current Procedural Terminology codes. The open group contained 3,590 cases (21.8%) and the arthroscopic group had 12,882 cases (78.2%), for a total of 16,472 patients undergoing RCR. The risk of complications was compared between the 2 groups, along with patient demographic characteristics, operative time, length of stay, and unplanned readmission within 30 days. We compared dichotomous variables using the Fisher exact test and continuous variables with 1-way analysis of variance. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated when appropriate. RESULTS: The open RCR group had a higher prevalence of patients aged 65 years or older and comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and alcoholism (P < .05). Patients undergoing open RCR had a higher risk of any adverse event when compared with arthroscopic RCR patients (1.48% vs 0.84%; RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P = .0010). They were also at higher risk of return to the operating room within 30 days (0.70% vs 0.26%; RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09-1.69; P = .0004). Open RCR was associated with a longer average hospital stay (0.48 +/- 2.7 days vs 0.23 +/- 4.2 days, P = .0007), whereas arthroscopic RCR had a longer average operative time (90 +/- 45 minutes vs 79 +/- 45 minutes, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Although both open and arthroscopic approaches to RCR had low morbidity, arthroscopy was associated with lower risks of any adverse event and return to the operating room during the initial 30-day postoperative period. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many poor outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff (RC) repair relate to failure of tendon healing. The purposes of this study were to provide a better understanding of the magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) characteristics of the RC tendon repair site after arthroscopic RC repair and to examine how these findings influence patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and the presence of persistent symptoms. METHODS: We reviewed 48 shoulders (13 female and 35 male patients; average age, 53.8 years) at a minimum of 6 months (average, 11.4 months) after arthroscopic RC repair (average tear size, 2.2 cm). All patients completed PROMs and underwent MRA assessment. Detailed analysis of the RC repair site was undertaken, with findings correlated with clinical outcomes and PROMs. RESULTS: The average preoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score of 39.5 improved to 92.8 (P < .001). All but 6 patients (87.5%) had increased signal intensity of the involved tendon, with interstitial splits and/or delamination in 65.6%. These changes had no effect on PROMs or patient satisfaction. Significant partial-thickness tears (>50%) were observed in 7 patients (14.6%), with no effect on outcomes (average ASES score of 95.2 and satisfaction score of 9). There were 2 recurrent full-thickness tears (4.2%), and 4 patients (8.3%) had a failure in continuity. The average ASES score in these 6 cases of failure was 76 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Structural abnormalities on MRA are common after RC repair but do not always result in clinical failure. However, our results suggest that an ASES score of less than 80 may be useful when considering postoperative imaging, especially in a patient with ongoing pain more than 6 months after surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effect of platelet-rich plasma fibrin matrix (PRPFM) construct augmentation on postoperative tendon healing as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical outcome of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: A comparative series of patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was studied. Two matched groups of patients (20 each) were included: rotator cuff repairs without PRPFM augmentation (group 1) and rotator cuff repairs augmented with 2 sutured platelet-rich plasma (PRP) constructs (group 2). A single-row cuff repair to the normal footprint without tension or marrow vents was performed by a single surgeon. Postoperative rehabilitation was held constant. Postoperative MRI scans were used to evaluate rotator cuff healing. Outcome measures included American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Rowe, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, Simple Shoulder Test, and Constant scores. RESULTS: We followed up 40 patients (2 matched groups with 20 patients each) with a mean age of 57 years (range, 44 to 69 years) for a mean of 31 months (range, 24 to 44 months). Postoperative MRI studies showed persistent full-thickness tendon defects in 60% of controls (12 of 20) and 30% of PRPFM-augmented repairs (6 of 20) (P = .03). Of the control group tears measuring less than 3 cm in anteroposterior length, 50% (7 of 14) healed fully, whereas 86% of the PRPFM group tears measuring less than 3 cm in anteroposterior length (12 of 14) healed fully (P < .05). There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in terms of American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (94.7 and 95.7, respectively; P = .35), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (93.7 and 94.5, respectively; P = .37), Simple Shoulder Test (11.4 and 11.3, respectively; P = .41), and Constant (84.7 and 88.1, respectively; P = .19) scores. The Rowe scores (84.8 and 94.9, respectively; P = .03) were statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 2 PRPFM constructs sutured into a primary rotator cuff tendon repair resulted in lower retear rates identified on MRI than repairs without the constructs. Other than the Rowe scores, there was no postoperative clinical difference by use of standard outcome measures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control study.

AB  - PURPOSE: The incidence of retear following rotator cuff repair remains a major concern, and the cause and timing of retear remain unclear. The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the timing of retears following rotator cuff repair at multiple time intervals. The hypothesis was that the 'critical period' for retears extends beyond the first three post-operative months. METHODS: The authors prospectively studied 206 shoulders that underwent arthroscopic double-row (without suture bridge) suture anchor repair for rotator cuff tears. Patients were recalled to three follow-up visits at the following post-operative time intervals: 3, 6, and 12 months or longer. Ultrasonography was performed at each visit, and Constant score was collected during the last visit. RESULTS: A total of 176 shoulders attended all required follow-up visits with mean age 56.0 years. Ultrasonography revealed retears in 16 shoulders (9.1 %) at 3 months, in 6 shoulders (3.4 %) at 6 months, and in 5 others (2.8 %) at the last follow-up, while it confirmed intact rotator cuffs in 149 shoulders (84.7 %) at the last follow-up (median 35.5; range 12-61). The incidence of retears was significantly associated with tear size (p = 0.001) and tendon degeneration (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The 'critical period' for healing following rotator cuff repair, during which risks of retears are high, extends to the first 6 months. The risk of retear is greatest for massive 3-tendon tears, which may require longer periods of protection. The clinical relevance of this study is the identification of patients at risk of retear and the adjustment of their rehabilitation strategy and time for return to work. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tears have long been recognised as a cause of pain and disability. Over the past decades the treatment of rotator cuff tears has evolved from an open procedure to a mini-open procedure to an all-arthroscopic one. The indications and benefits of each of the procedures are still debated. The purpose of this study was to observe the results of "Mini-open repair rotator cuff tear". MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted in the postgraduate department of Ortho-paedics Government Medical College, Srinagar, from March 2013 to January 2018 with cases followed up for a minimum of 3 years. This study included 50 patients of either sex with non-massive full thickness tears of rotator cuff. RESULTS: The mean UCLA score improved from 10.96 preoperatively to 30.68 at final follow-up. Overall, 88% of the patients achieved excellent or good results and 92% were satisfied. No significant difference was noted in functional outcomes between traumatic and degenerative tears. Size of tear seems to be a determining factor in the functional outcome. Stiffness as a complication occurred in two patients. CONCLUSION: 1. Mini-open rotator cuff tear repair eliminated sym-pto-matic full thickness rotator cuff tears with significant improvement in functional scores. 2. There were no major complications of the surgical procedure adop-ted or the fixation method used. 3. Mini-open rotator cuff repair remains a useful technique despite advan-ces in arthroscopy.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND: The percutaneous intra-articular transtendon technique (PITT) is a simple, rapid, and low-cost method of performing a biceps tenodesis. Few studies exist that examine the patient-determined outcomes of this technique in general or in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) with and without biceps tenodesis. We hypothesized that patients undergoing an isolated arthroscopic RCR would have equivalent outcomes to those undergoing RCRs with PITT biceps tenodesis. METHODS: We compared preoperative, patient-determined outcomes scores on patients undergoing primary arthroscopic RCR with and without a PITT biceps tenodesis with postoperative scores at a minimum of 2 years. These scores included the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff score (WORC), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and Shoulder Activity Level (SAL). Indication for a concomitant biceps tenodesis was a partial long head biceps tendon tear or biceps instability/subluxation. RESULTS: A total of 153 patients underwent an isolated RCR and 131 patients underwent RCR with biceps tenodesis (RCRBT). Both groups had improvements in WORC, ASES, SANE, and SST (P < .0001) and deteriorations in the SAL (P <= .005). There was no difference in the change in outcome scores between the groups (RCRBT vs. RCR, respectively) for WORC (46 vs. 47; P = .85), ASES (46 vs. 47; P = .82), SANE (53 vs. 51; P = .35), SST (5.8 vs. 5.8; P = .93), and SAL (-0.9 vs. -1.4; P = .46). There was no difference between the groups in complications that required revision surgery (1.5% vs. 1.3%; P = .91). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic PITT RCRBT is safe and effective with equivalent patient-determined outcomes compared with patients undergoing RCR without biceps tenodesis.

AB  - Background: Rotator cuff tears are associated with capsular contraction and stiffness that should be restored before surgical repair. Corticosteroid injections (CSIs) are frequently used as conservative treatments before surgical repair. This study aimed to determine the influence of preoperative and postoperative CSIs on clinical and anatomic outcomes after rotator cuff repair. Methods: The authors analyzed the records of 257 patients who had arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, of whom 212 were evaluated at 3.1 +/- 1.0 years (median, 2.9 years; range, 1.4-7.1 years) by clinical (Constant score) and ultrasound (Sugaya classification) examinations. Univariable and multivariable regressions were performed to determine associations between outcomes and administration of preoperative and postoperative CSIs, patient characteristics, and tendon characteristics. Results: The Constant scores improved from 56.4 +/- 15.1 to 80.8 +/- 12.5. Multivariable regression confirmed that postoperative scores were associated with postoperative CSIs (P < .001), preoperative scores (P < .001), gender (P < .001), and fatty infiltration (P < .005). Retears (Sugaya types IV-V) were observed in 27 shoulders (13%). Multivariable regression clarified that retear rates were associated only with postoperative CSIs (P = .007) and stage 3 fatty infiltration (P = .001). Adjusting for confounders, an additional postoperative CSI would decrease scores by 4.7 points and double retear risks. Discussion: Preoperative CSIs had no influence on clinical scores and retear rates, whereas postoperative CSIs were associated with lower scores and more retears. Although we can infer that preoperative CSIs do not affect outcomes, we cannot determine whether postoperative CSIs compromised outcomes or were administered in patients who had already poor outcomes. Our findings may resolve controversies about the administration of preoperative CSIs.

AB  - PURPOSE: Arthroscopic techniques tend to become the gold standard in rotator cuff repair. However, little data are reported in the literature regarding the improvement of postoperative outcomes and re-tear rate relative to conventional open surgery. The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes and cuff integrity after arthroscopic versus open cuff repair. METHODS: We prospectively assessed clinical outcomes and cuff integrity after an arthroscopic or open rotator cuff repair with a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Clinical evaluation was based on Constant score, Simple Shoulder Value (SSV) and American Shoulder and Elbow Score (ASES). Rotator cuff healing was explored with ultrasound. RESULTS: 44 patients in arthroscopic group A (mean age 56-year-old) and 43 in open group O (mean age 61-year-old) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Tendons were repaired with a single row technique associated with biceps tenodesis and subacromial decompression. All objective clinical scores significantly improved postoperatively in both groups. No statistical difference was identified between group A and O regarding, respectively, Constant score (72 vs 75 points; p = 0.3), ASES score (88 vs 91 points; p = 0.3), and SSV (81 vs 85%). The overall rate of re-tear (Sugaya type IV or V) reached 7 and 9%, respectively, in group A and O (p = 0.8). CONCLUSION: This study did not prove any difference of arthroscopic over open surgery in case of rotator cuff repair regarding clinical outcome and cuff integrity at 1-year follow-up. LEVEL II: Prospective comparative study.

AB  - Background: Although being the historical gold standard for rotator cuff repair, open transosseous (TO) repair was largely replaced by anchor-based methods with the advent of arthroscopic surgery owing to their comparative ease of use. However, suture anchors are at risk of dislodgement, especially among older patients, who have more osteopenic bone or those presenting large tears. Considering the ever-increasing active life expectancy and associated increased quality of life expectations by older generations, the need to offer safe and efficient surgical treatments to these patients imposes itself. Arthroscopic TO repairs would combine the best of both worlds and be well adapted to these populations. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the functional outcome and complication rate of the TO arthroscopic repair technique when using a 2-mm braided suture tape. The secondary objective of this study was to assess functional outcome of TO repair in older patients and patients with >3-cm tears. Methods: One hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tear who underwent arthroscopic TO (anchorless) rotator cuff repair between January 2011 and December 2013 were reviewed. The surgery was performed by a single surgeon with a reusable curved suture passer and 2-mm braided tape suture. Follow-up was 3 to 5 years (mean = 50 months). All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative functional assessments (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Quick Dash) and were questioned with their overall satisfaction. Results: Thirty-eight (28%) of the 137 patients were 65 years and older, and 62 (45%) had a large or massive tear. One patient (0.7%) had early retear at the suture-tendon interface after trauma 3 weeks postoperatively. The average Quick Dash score improved by 55.6 points and the average American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score improved by 69.7 points 3.5 and 6.3 times their minimal clinically important differences, respectively. There was no significant difference in final functional outcomes between patients 65 years and older and younger patients or between patients with large and massive (>3 cm) and smaller tears (<=3 cm). Mean operative time was 68 min +/- 16. Conclusions: Arthroscopic TO repair using a 2-mm tape material has achieved significant mid-term functional improvement, with results statistically unaffected by larger tear size (>3 cm) or older age (>=65 years).

AB  - Retears of the rotator cuff, following operative repair, is not an uncommon event. Various factors have been shown to influence recurrence including the technique of repair. Multiple techniques have been performed with varying results and complications. The repair technique significantly affects the rate and pattern of retears. Although risk of retears with double row and suture bridge techniques is relatively low, medial cuff failure is a potential complication which poses significant challenges when revision repair is undertaken. Modifications in surgical techniques in, both, double row and suture bridge repairs can help decrease the risk of medial cuff failure. Thorough analysis of retear rates and patterns reported, and their relation with the repair technique, provides new insights about the pathogenesis of rotator cuff retears, their future prevention and appropriate management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tears are a common clinical problem, and few long-term studies concerning the outcomes of rotator cuff repairs have been performed. The purpose of this study was to report the fifteen-year outcomes of arthroscopic subacromial decompression with mini-open rotator cuff repair. METHODS: The study included seventy-nine patients who had undergone arthroscopic subacromial decompression with mini-open rotator cuff repair from 1993 to 1996. Outcomes were reviewed in 1997, 2002, and 2010. At the final review, forty-nine patients (forty-nine shoulders) were available or were suitable for evaluation. There were eight large tears, forty medium tears, and one small tear. The patients were assessed with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score at each evaluation. The mean age of the patients at the time of follow-up was 70.1 years, and the mean follow-up period was 15.6 years. RESULTS: At the time of final follow-up, the outcome was good or excellent in thirty-four patients (69%), fair in seven, and poor in eight. Three patients required a reoperation. Between the two and fifteen-year evaluations, twenty-nine patients (59%) had maintained their good or excellent result; the overall raw scores had deteriorated for fifteen patients (31%), and they had improved for twenty-four (49%). Forty-one patients (84%) were satisfied with the final outcome of the shoulder surgery. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that arthroscopic subacromial decompression with mini-open rotator cuff repair can provide a lasting, durable, and satisfactory outcome for a large proportion of patients fifteen years after surgery. Patient satisfaction at the final evaluation did not necessarily correspond with a good or an excellent UCLA score.

AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to clarify the relationship between chronic preoperative opioids and complications following rotator cuff repair. Specifically, we assessed revision, a definitive postoperative end point for surgical outcome. METHODS: This study used PearlDiver, a United States national insurance claims database. All patients undergoing rotator cuff repair from 2008 to 2018 were identified and stratified based on a minimum of 2 opioid prescriptions within the 6 months before surgery, with 1 prescription occurring within 0 to 3 months before surgery and a second prescription within 4 to 6 months before surgery. Univariate logistic regressions of risk factors were conducted, followed by multivariate analysis of comorbidities, including ongoing preoperative opioids, any preoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescriptions, age, sex, diabetes, tobacco, and obesity. RESULTS: In total, 28,939 patients undergoing rotator cuff repair were identified, of whom 10,695 had opioid prescriptions within both 0 to 3 months and 4 to 6 months before index rotator cuff repair, whereas 18,244 had no opioid prescriptions within the 6-month preoperative period. In total, 977 (3.4%) patients underwent revision within 6 months, which increased to 1311 (4.5%) within 1 year of the index procedure. In the multivariate analysis controlling for age, preoperative NSAID prescriptions, tobacco, diabetes, obesity, and sex, we observed a significant association between chronic preoperative opioid prescriptions and rotator cuff repair revision (6-month odds ratio 1.12; P = .021, 1-year odds ratio 1.43; P < .001) following index procedure. CONCLUSIONS: We report increased rates of revision within both 6 months and 1 year in patients with prolonged preoperative opioid prescriptions. The opioid cohort had greater rates of preoperative NSAID use and tobacco use, which also were observed to be independent risk factors for revision at both timepoints. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III; Retrospective comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report on the medium- to long-term results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to determine whether rotator cuff repair confers any advantage over arthroscopic sub-acromial decompression (ASAD) alone in the management of medium-sized rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Ethical approval was sought to follow-up patients previously enrolled in a completed and previously published RCT comparing the outcome of ASAD with mini-open cuff repair for the treatment of rotator cuff tear. Forty-two patients were enrolled in the original study, with a mean of 64 years (range 54 years to 77 years). RESULTS: Fifteen of the original 17 patients randomized to ASAD alone and 18 of the original 25 patients randomized to cuff repair were available for follow-up. Each patient underwent American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and Constant scoring, and clinical and ultrasound examination. Mean duration of follow-up was 7 years (range 5 years to 11 years). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of ASES, DASH and Constant scores at follow-up between the two groups. Some 33% of patients in the cuff-repair group had a proven re-rupture on ultrasound. This patient subgroup had significantly worse Constant scores compared to patients where the repair remained intact. None of the patients from either group developed cuff-tear arthropathy requiring arthroplasty surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In this medium- to longer-term study, there is no demonstrable significant benefit of cuff repair over decompression alone for the treatment of medium-sized rotator cuff tears, in terms of ASES, DASH and Constant scores for pain, function and strength modules. The presence of cuff tear does not necessitate surgical repair. This conclusion should drive surgical strategies and shared decision-making between patients and surgeons.

AB  - Background/aim: Sleep disturbance and related improvement in quality of life as a result of arthroscopic repair in rotator cuff tear (RCT) patients can be considered as an important parameter. The aim of our study is to evaluate the rotator cuff by ultrasonography (USG) in the first postoperative year and to examine whether there is a difference between sleep disturbance and quality of life between cases of rupture and healthy patients. In addition, we aim to compare the preoperative and at least the first postoperative year's sleep disturbances and quality of life among patients who underwent arthroscopic RCT repair and to examine the effects of factors affecting this situation. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who were operated on for RCT. In this process, 257 patients were examined and 76 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. The Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), Constant-Murley shoulder score (CSS), and Oxford shoulder score (OSS) were used to evaluate the results preoperatively and at the last control visit of each patient. In the USG performed in the postoperative first year, the rotor cuff was evaluated in terms of rerupture. Results: It was observed that 14 (18.4%) patients' rotor cuffs were reruptured and those of 62 (81.6%) patients were intact. The preoperative PSQI, CSS, and OSS values of the patients were calculated as an average of 10.79 +/- 3.58, 35.61 +/- 8.88, and 17.61 +/- 4.20 and the mean postoperative values were calculated as 5.45 +/- 1.68, 81.55 +/- 5.27, and 38.05 +/- 3.06, respectively. The postoperative PSQI value was statistically significantly lower in patients with tears of <1 cm (PSQI: 4.29 +/- 0.73) than in those with tears of 1-3 cm (PSQI: 5.50 +/- 2.17) and 3-5 cm (PSQI: 5.88 +/- 1.25) (P < 0.001). The mean CSS and OSS values were significantly higher in postoperative measurements for all tear types. According to the size of the tear, postoperative CSS and OSS values were statistically significantly lower in patients with tears of 3-5 cm (CSS: 78.59 +/- 4.50 and OSS: 36.18 +/- 2.47) than those with <1 cm (CSS: 85.43 +/- 2.14 and OSS: 40.57 +/- 1.55) and 1-3 cm (CSS: 83.21 +/- 5.35 and OSS: 39.07 +/- 2.94) tears (P < 0.001). Conclusion: In the USG performed in the postoperative first year, it was determined that the patients with healthy rotator cuffs recovered better than those with rerupture.

AB  - The goal of this study was to review the authors' initial experience with arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair. Thirty-one patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears underwent arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair over a 15-month period. Preoperatively, demographics and subjective scores were recorded. Postoperatively, pain levels, subjective shoulder values, satisfaction scores, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, complications, and reoperations were noted with a minimum 2-year follow-up. The relationships between pre- and intraoperative variables and outcome scores were determined with univariate analysis. Average patient age was 56 years, and 23 patients (74%) were men. Twenty patients (65%) underwent primary rotator cuff repair, and 11 patients (35%) underwent revision repair. Average time to follow-up was 26 months. Average preoperative pain level and subjective shoulder value were 5.1 of 10 and 35%, respectively. Average postoperative scores included pain level of 0.9 of 10, subjective shoulder value of 84%, satisfaction score of 90.6 of 100, and ASES score of 86.3 of 100. There were 3 (9.7%) major and 2 (6%) minor complications. Patients undergoing revision rotator cuff repair had significantly worse outcomes (pain level, subjective shoulder value, ASES score; P<.05) compared with those undergoing primary repair, and cortical augmentation did not significantly affect outcome. Overall, outcomes after arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair are good, although patients undergoing revision repair do not have the same outcomes as those undergoing primary cuff repair. The procedure is not without complications (9.7% major, 6% minor complications). Cortical augmentation may be used to supplement fixation, although it does not necessarily affect outcomes. Patients without such augmentation may be at increased risk for suture cutout through the bone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While patient age, tear size, and muscle fatty infiltration are factors known to affect the rate of tendon healing after rotator cuff repair, the effect of tendon delamination is less known. PURPOSE: To assess the effect of tendon delamination on rotator cuff healing after arthroscopic single-row (SR) repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Consecutive patients (N = 117) with chronic full-thickness rotator cuff tears underwent arthroscopic SR repair with the tension-band cuff repair. The mean +/- SD age at the time of surgery was 60 +/- 8 years. There were 25 small, 63 medium, and 29 large tears. Tendon delamination was assessed intraoperatively under arthroscopy with the arthroscope placed in the lateral portal. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with nondelaminated (n = 80) and delaminated (n = 37) cuff tears. The 2 groups were comparable for age, sex, body mass index, preoperative pain, strength, and a Constant-Murley score. Repair integrity was evaluated with sonography (mean, 24 months after surgery; range, 6-62 months) and classified into 3 categories: type A, indicating complete, homogeneous, and thick coverage of the footprint; type B, partial coverage with a thin tendon; and type C, no coverage of the footprint. RESULTS: The prevalence of tendon delamination observed under arthroscopy was 32% (37 of 117), which increased with tear size and retraction: from 15% in small tears to 32% in medium tears and 45% in large tears ( P = .028). Postoperatively, 83 patients had complete coverage of footprint (type A = 71%) and the cuff was considered healed, whereas 26 had partial coverage or a thin tendon (type B = 22%) and 8 had no coverage (type C = 7%). Overall, the rate of complete healing was 78% in nondelaminated cuff tears and 57% in the case of tendon delamination ( P = .029). In large retracted tears, the healing rate dropped from 81% in the absence of delamination to 39% when the tendons were delaminated ( P = .027). CONCLUSION: Tendon delamination increases with tear size and retraction. Patients with chronic delaminated and retracted rotator cuff tears (stage 2 or 3) are at risk of failure after SR cuff repair, whereas patients with small delaminated rotator cuff tears (stage 1) involving only the supraspinatus can be treated with an SR cuff repair with a high chance of tendon healing. These results suggest that SR cuff repair may be insufficient to treat delaminated chronic cuff tears. To improve the anatomic outcomes of rotator cuff repairs, surgeons should consider treating delaminated tears with a double-row or double-layer repair.

AB  - Aims: Large population-based studies have demonstrated increased prevalence of rotator cuff disease amongst diabetics. Recent studies have suggested comparable clinical outcomes from rotator cuff repair despite suggestions of increased complication rates amongst diabetics. However, there is a relative paucity of studies considering the effect of diabetes upon complication rate. We aim to report and quantify the effect of diabetes on complication rates following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Materials and methods: A retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between January 2011 and December 2014 was performed. Diabetic status and complication data defined as infection, frozen shoulder, re-tear or re-operation were collected and interrogated. Results: A total of 462 patients were included at median follow-up of 5.6 years. Diabetics were significantly more likely to experience frozen shoulder (15.8% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.001), re-tear (26.3% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.042) or at least one complication following surgery (35.1% vs. 22.7%, p = 0.041) compared to non-diabetics. These equated to odds ratios of 4.03, 1.94 and 1.84, respectively. Conclusions: Diabetic patients are almost twice as likely to experience complications following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, including double the risk of repair failure and more than four times the risk of frozen shoulder.

AB  - PURPOSE: We assessed cuff integrity after arthroscopic repair of small full-thickness supraspinatus tears (<2 cm) and the correlation with clinical results and predisposing factors for recurrence. We hypothesized that clinical results depend on tendon healing, which is obtained in almost all cases. METHODS: The study included 46 small supraspinatus tears in 46 patients. Mean age was 56.8 years (range, 39-75 years). Preoperative and postoperative functions were assessed by the Constant-Murley (CM) score. The integrity of the repair was evaluated by ultrasonography. The average follow-up was 35 months (range, 24-60 months). RESULTS: The mean absolute CM score improved significantly (P < .001) from 46.8 points (range, 34-62 points) preoperatively to 76 (range, 51-98) at the last follow-up. The result was excellent or good in 76.1%, and 42 (91.3%) were subjectively very satisfied or satisfied with the final result. The supraspinatus was completely healed on imaging studies in 33 patients (71.8%). The presence of an intratendinous cleavage of the supraspinatus was the only factor associated with a postoperative rerupture (P = .044). There was no association between functional and anatomic results. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair of small supraspinatus tears yields favorable clinical and anatomic results at a mean of 35 months after surgery. Retearing is relatively common, but has no effect on the clinical result except that patients with radiographic signs of tendon healing appear to have increased postoperative ability to perform activities of daily living (P = .022). An intratendinous cleavage is the only significant predisposing factor for recurrence.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare the functional and structural outcomes of 2 techniques for double-row, suture-bridging cuff repair. METHODS: A consecutive series of 73 patients who underwent arthroscopic, double-row, suture-bridge primary rotator cuff repair of full-thickness supraspinatus tear were evaluated. Thirty-eight shoulders were repaired by the arthroscopic, tied, suture-bridging technique (group A), and 35 shoulders by knot-less bridging with suture tape material (group B). Constant scores, pain, range of motion, strength, and complications were measured after a minimum follow-up period of 12 months post-operatively. Structural integrity of the repairs was evaluated systematically by either magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography arthrography. RESULTS: Median follow-up after surgery was 29 (23-32) months in group A, and 21 (12-23) months in group B. Mean pain relief, range of motion, strength, and constant score improved significantly in both groups. No statistical differences were found between groups in the post-operative period. According to control imaging, the re-tear rate trended to be higher in group A (23.4 %) than in group B (17.1 %), although not significantly. CONCLUSION: Both bridging repair techniques achieved successful functional outcomes. In terms of structural outcome, the knot-less tape-bridging construct showed a lower but not significant re-tear rate. Longer follow-up is needed to confirm these results and to evaluate potential differences between the two techniques. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: A prospective, non-randomized, comparative study, Level III.

AB  - To evaluate the null hypothesis of no difference in degree of pain or stiffness between patients with partial- and full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, we measured pain and stiffness in a cohort of consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopy for rotator cuff-related conditions. Pain was measured with a visual analogue scale, and range of motion was measured with a goniometer. Included in the study were 410 shoulders (410 patients), of which 214 had no tear, 66 had articular-sided partial-thickness tears, and 83 had single-tendon full-thickness tears. There was no statistical difference for measurements of pain or stiffness between patients with partial- and full-thickness tears, and hence the null hypothesis was upheld. Neither pain nor stiffness should be used as a diagnostic indicator for differentiation of partial- and full-thickness rotator cuff tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal technique for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is still controversial. Large tears with a high grade of retraction have an especially high risk of retearing. This study reports the clinical and radiologic results of a triple-row modified suture bridge technique for the treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with medium and high grades of retraction. METHODS: A total of 101 shoulders in 100 patients underwent a triple-row modified suture bridge reconstruction for full-thickness rotator cuff tears with retraction grade II and grade III according to Patte; 81 patients were reached for follow-up 36.2 months after surgery. At follow-up, clinical outcome was assessed by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, subjective shoulder value, visual analog scale score, University of California-Los Angeles shoulder score, and Constant score (CS). At follow-up, an ultrasound examination was performed to determine tendon integrity or retears in all patients. RESULTS: The overall retear rate was 4.9% (4/81). The clinical outcome was good to excellent (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 94 +/- 11; subjective shoulder value, 92 +/- 12; University of California-Los Angeles shoulder score, 33 +/- 5; Constant score, 90 +/- 9). In the radiologic follow-up, no retear was found in any of the follow-up patients after an average of 36.2 months. There was no significant difference in clinical outcome parameters between rotator cuff tears Patte II and Patte III (P > .05). CONCLUSION: For tears with a high grade of retraction, surgical treatment using a triple-row modified suture bridge technique represents a good treatment option with a low rate of retearing and good to excellent clinical results.

AB  - Background: Among many advances in the treatment of rotator cuff tears, arthroscopic augmentation techniques with patches of various biological and synthetic graft materials have been introduced to reinforce the repair. However, structural and functional outcomes after patch augmentation vary, and reinforcing the tendon healing remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical and radiologic outcomes 1 year after arthroscopic posterosuperior (PS) rotator cuff repair with bioabsorbable patch augmentation. Methods: From October 2014 to December 2017, all patients with PS rotator cuff tears undergoing arthroscopic repair with patch augmentation using a resorbable, biologically derived poly-4-hydroxybutyrate patch (Biofiber; Wright, Memphis, TN, USA) were enrolled in this study. Only full-thickness PS lesions with >=1 of the following tear patterns were augmented with a patch and were the subject of this study: large U- and L-shaped tear, transtendinous tear, delamination, and fraying of the bursal layer. Patients were examined preoperatively and at 1 year postoperatively with a standardized examination protocol and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: Sixteen patients were included in this study; 1 patient was lost to follow-up. One patient only underwent clinical follow-up. We detected 1 repair failure (6.7%) with dislocation of the lateral-row anchors on computed tomography scanning at 3 months postoperatively. MRI was performed in 14 patients after 1 year; in all of them, the cuff repair was intact. The Sugaya tendon integrity score was 1.7 +/- 0.9. The Constant-Murley score improved from 44 to 89 points (P < .001). Muscular strength improved in the supraspinatus (from 2.6 to 4.8), infraspinatus (from 3.2 to 4.9), and subscapularis (from 4 to 4.9) (all P < .001). Overall, patient satisfaction was high (3.6 +/- 0.6). Discussion: This small-sized case series is the first to prospectively assess clinical and radiologic outcomes after patch augmentation of PS rotator cuff tears using bioabsorbable poly-4-hydroxybutyrate patches. Good to excellent structural and functional outcomes were observed with a low retear rate (6.7%) and good tendon integrity on 1-year postoperative MRI, and the graft did not cause any complications. The use of bioabsorbable patches could be beneficial when unfavorable PS tear patterns are encountered in which a stable repair of the full tendon thickness at its insertion is otherwise difficult to reach.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Risk factors for stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) have been limited to studies with small patient numbers. The objective is to determine patient-related risk factors for stiffness after RCR. METHODS: The PearlDiver database was queried from 2007 to 2015 for patients undergoing isolated arthroscopic RCR. A multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis assessed for risk factors requiring a postoperative manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) or lysis of adhesions (LOA) within 9 months after RCR. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-two of 19,229 patients (1.2%) underwent a LOA and/or MUA within 9 months after arthroscopic RCR. Significant risk factors identified were age less than 50 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.9; P < 0.0001), female gender (OR, 2.0; P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (DM) type I (OR, 2.7; P < 0.0001), hypothyroidism (OR, 1.3; P = 0.020), and systemic lupus erythematosus (OR, 2.1; P = 0.004). However, tobacco use was associated with a 0.5 risk of developing stiffness (P < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Systemic lupus erythematosus, hypothyroidism, and DMI (but not DMII) in addition to young age and female gender were risk factors for LOA/MUA after arthroscopic RCR.

AB  - Background: Biologic technologies can potentially augment existing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair to improve retear rates and postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate healing rates and clinical outcomes of full-thickness rotator cuff repairs augmented with a bioinductive bovine collagen implant. Methods: In this prospective multicenter study, investigators enrolled 115 patients (mean age, 60.4 years) with full-thickness rotator cuff tears. There were 66 (57.4%) medium (1-3 cm) tears and 49 (42.6%) large (3-5 cm) tears. Eligible patients consisted of those >=21 years of age with chronic shoulder pain lasting longer than 3 months and unresponsive to conservative therapy. Patients underwent single- or double-row repair augmented with a bioinductive bovine collagen implant. At the baseline, 3 months, and 1 year, magnetic resonance imaging was performed and patients were assessed for American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Shoulder Score and Constant-Murley Score (CMS). The primary failure end point was retear, classified as any new full-thickness defect observed on magnetic resonance imaging. Results: There were 13 retears (11.3%) at 3 months, with an additional 6 (19 total [16.5%]) found at 1 year. In large tears, double-row repair had a significantly lower rate of retear at 3 months (P = .0004) and 1 year (P = .0001) compared with single-row repair. ASES and CMS scores significantly improved between the baseline and 1 year for medium and large tears. At 1 year, the minimally clinically important difference for ASES and CMS was met by 91.7% (95% CI: 84.9-96.1) and 86.4% (95% CI: 78.2-92.4) of patients, respectively. Patients without retear and those <65 years of age had significantly better CMS scores at 1 year when compared with those with retear and those >=65 years (P < .05). There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes based on treatment of the biceps tendon. Of 9 reported reoperations in the operative shoulder, only 2 were considered potentially related to the collagen implant. Conclusion: Interim results from this prospective study indicate a favorable rate of retear relative to the literature and improvement in clinical function at 1 year after adjunctive treatment with the study implant augmenting standard arthroscopic repair techniques.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated retraction in the setting of acute rotator cuff tears and determined its effects on patient outcomes and tendon repair integrity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 patients had surgery within 6 weeks or less from the time of injury. Fifteen of these patients were prospectively followed at a minimum of 2 years; average 40.5 months (range 24-69). Pre-operative objective and subjective outcomes were compared. Tendon repair integrity was assessed with ultrasound at a minimum of 1 year from surgery. The population was stratified into Group 1 (8 patients) with minimal intra-operative medial tendon retraction to the mid-line level of the humeral head and Group 2 (7 patients) with a large medial tendon retraction to the glenohumeral joint or greater. RESULTS: The average time to surgery from the onset of symptoms was 27 days (range, 6-42). Post-operative motion increased significantly for external rotation and forward elevation, 77% of patients were pain free, 80% were completely satisfied, and 100% would have the surgery again. Group 1 (small retraction) versus Group 2 (large retraction) showed that post-operative pain levels, satisfaction, range of motion, strength, subjective shoulder value (95.4% vs. 92.3%), Constant Score (80.8 vs. 78.1), and American Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (96.2 vs. 93.5) scores were not statistically different. Ultrasound showed a tendon repair integrity rate of 87%. 2 patients who did have a re-tear were in Group 2, yet had comparative outcomes. CONCLUSION: In acute rotator cuff tears, equal patient satisfaction, pain scores, range of motion, strength, and outcome measures should be expected with surgical repair despite the level of retraction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level IV.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the association of postoperative fluoroquinolone use following arthroscopic primary rotator cuff repair with failure requiring revision rotator cuff repair. METHODS: An insurance database was queried for patients undergoing rotator cuff repair from 2007 to 2015. These patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients prescribed fluoroquinolones within 6 months postoperatively (divided into 0-2, 2-4, and 4-6 months), (2) a matched negative control cohort of patients not prescribed fluoroquinolones, and (3) a matched positive control cohort of patients prescribed fluoroquinolones between 6 and 18 months following rotator cuff repair. Rates of failure requiring revision rotator cuff repair were compared within 2 years. RESULTS: A total of 1292 patients were prescribed fluoroquinolones within 6 months after rotator cuff repair, including 442 within 2 months, 433 within 2 to 4 months, and 417 within 4 to 6 months, and were compared to 5225 matched negative controls and 1597 matched positive controls. The rate of revision rotator cuff repair was significantly higher in patients prescribed fluoroquinolones within 2 months (6.1 %) compared to matched negative (2.2 %, P = 0.0009) and positive controls (2.4 %, P = 0.0026). There were no significant differences in the rate of revision rotator cuff repair when fluoroquinolones were prescribed >2 months after rotator cuff repair. CONCLUSIONS: Early use of fluoroquinolones following rotator cuff repair was independently associated with significantly increased rates of failure requiring revision rotator cuff repair. This is the first clinical study examining the association of postoperative fluoroquinolone use with failure following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent animal studies have demonstrated that hyperlipidemia is associated with poor tendon-bone healing after rotator cuff repair; however, these findings have not been substantiated in human studies. PURPOSE: To examine any association between hyperlipidemia and the failure of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair requiring revision surgery and to investigate whether the use of statin lipid-lowering agents had any influence on observed associations. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: From a national insurance database, patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with perioperative lipid levels (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein [LDL], and triglycerides) recorded were reviewed. For each lipid test, patients were stratified into normal, moderate, and high groups based on published standards. For the total cholesterol and LDL cohorts, a subgroup analysis of patients stratified by statin use was performed. The primary outcome measure was ipsilateral revision rotator cuff surgery, including revision repair or debridement. A logistic regression analysis controlling for patient demographics and comorbidities was utilized for comparison. RESULTS: There were 30,638 patients included in the study. The rate of revision rotator cuff surgery was significantly increased in patients with moderate (odds ratio [OR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03-1.40; P = .022) and high total cholesterol levels (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.10-1.55; P = .006) compared with patients with normal total cholesterol levels perioperatively. Within each of these groups, patients without statin use had significantly higher rates of revision surgery, while those with statin prescriptions did not. The absolute risk reduction for statin use ranged from 0.24% to 1.87% when stratified by the total cholesterol level, yielding a number needed to treat from 54 to 408 patients. The rate of revision surgery was significantly increased in patients with moderate (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10-1.41; P = .001) and high LDL levels (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.08-1.99; P = .014) compared with patients with normal LDL levels perioperatively. Again, patients without statin prescriptions had significantly increased rates of revision surgery, whereas patients with statin use did not. The absolute risk reduction for statin use ranged from 0.26% to 1.89% when stratified by the LDL level, yielding a number needed to treat from 53 to 387 patients. There were no significant differences in the rates of revision rotator cuff surgery between patients with moderate and high triglyceride levels compared with patients with normal triglyceride levels. CONCLUSION: The present study found a significant association between moderate and high perioperative total cholesterol and LDL levels and the rate of revision surgery after primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Furthermore, the use of statin agents appeared to mitigate the need for revision rotator cuff repair. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate these preliminary findings and determine if better perioperative lipid control can improve clinical outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine any association between perioperative serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and failure of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) requiring revision surgery. METHODS: Using a private-payer national insurance database, patients who underwent arthroscopic RCR with perioperative serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels recorded were included. Patients were stratified into groups of (1) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL), (2) insufficiency (20-30 ng/mL), or (3) sufficient (>30-<150 ng/mL). The primary outcome measure was ipsilateral revision rotator cuff surgery, including revision repair, debridement, or reverse shoulder arthroplasty. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to control for patient demographics and comorbidities during comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 982 patients were included in the study. The rate of revision rotator cuff surgery was significantly higher in patients in the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D-deficient group (5.88%) compared with the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D-sufficient control group (3.7%) (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-5.8; P = .007). Patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (5.88%) also had a significantly higher incidence of revision surgery compared with patients with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.5-3.9; P = .011). There was no significant difference in the incidence of revision surgery in the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D-insufficient group (4.97%) compared with the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D-sufficient control group (3.7%) (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.3; P = .250). The absolute risk reduction of revision surgery for 25-hydroxyvitamin D-deficient patients compared with controls was 2.2%, corresponding to a number needed to treat to avoid 1 revision surgery of 46 patients, relative risk reduction = 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present study found a significant statistical association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and insufficiency and the rate of revision rotator cuff surgery after primary arthroscopic RCR, the absolute differences of these revision rates are minimal and are accompanied with overlapping confidence intervals limiting the clinical significance of these findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the association between glycemic control and adverse events after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who underwent arthroscopic RCR and had a hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) level determined within 3 months before or after surgery were identified in a national database and stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> level. The incidence of postoperative infection within 6 months was determined using Current Procedural Terminology and International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine whether a threshold HbA<sub>1c</sub> level existed above which the risk of infection, revision rotator cuff surgery, and lysis of adhesions (LOA)-manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) after arthroscopic RCR was significantly increased. This threshold was then tested using a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The study included 3,740 patients with an infection rate ranging from a low of 0.29% to a high of 1.14% after RCR. The inflection point of the ROC curve for infection corresponded to an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level between 7.0 and 8.0 mg/dL (P = .035; area under the curve, 0.648; specificity, 61%; sensitivity, 59%). We then used 8.0 mg/dL as a threshold to test for adverse outcomes. We found a significant difference in infection rates for patients with levels below versus above the threshold (0.30% vs 0.84%; OR, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.4; P = .014) but no difference in revision rates (P = .240) or LOA-MUA (P = .650) in patients with levels above versus below the threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of infection after RCR in patients with diabetes mellitus increases as the perioperative HbA<sub>1c</sub> level increases and, although statistically significant, remains low. ROC curve analysis determined that a perioperative HbA<sub>1c</sub> level above 8.0 mg/dL could serve as a threshold level; however, the area under the curve and low sensitivity reflected the poor utility of this test as an independent predictor. This study did not find an association between increased perioperative HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels and rates of revision rotator cuff surgery or LOA-MUA after RCR. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine any association between osteoporosis and the failure of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) leading to revision surgery and to investigate whether the use of bisphosphonates had any influence on the observed associations. METHODS: Patients who underwent ARCR with a diagnosis of osteoporosis were identified from the PearlDiver database and stratified according to whether there was a filled prescription for a bisphosphonate in the perioperative period. Patients with osteoporosis who underwent ARCR with bisphosphonate use were compared with age- and sex-matched patients who underwent ARCR with osteoporosis without a prescription for a bisphosphonate within 1 year of surgery and patients who underwent ARCR without a diagnosis of osteoporosis and no bisphosphonate use. The primary outcome measure was ipsilateral revision rotator cuff surgery, including revision repair, debridement for a diagnosis of a rotator cuff tear, or reverse shoulder arthroplasty. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to control for patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities during comparisons. RESULTS: We identified 2,706 patients, including 451 in the bisphosphonate study group; 902 in the osteoporosis, no-bisphosphonate control group; and 1,353 in the non-osteoporosis control group. Patients with osteoporosis, including those to whom bisphosphonates were prescribed, had a significantly higher rate of revision rotator cuff surgery (6.58%) than patients without osteoporosis (4.51%) (odds ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.97; P = .008). No significant difference in the rate of revision surgery was found between patients with osteoporosis using bisphosphonates (6.65%) and age- and sex-matched patients with osteoporosis not using bisphosphonates (6.54%, P = .718). CONCLUSIONS: By using an administrative database, this study was able to show a substantial difference in the revision surgery rate after ARCR in patients with osteoporosis compared with matched controls. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have reported acceptable clinical outcomes after simultaneous, single-stage bilateral and staged bilateral rotator cuff repair (RCR), few studies have been adequately powered to compare postoperative complication rates at various time intervals between procedures. PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between the timing of bilateral arthroscopic RCR and complications. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: Patients from the Medicare data set within the PearlDiver database who underwent bilateral RCR between 2005 and 2014 were identified. These patients were then stratified by time between surgeries into cohorts: (1) single stage, (2) <3 months, (3) 3 to 6 months, (4) 6 to 9 months, (5) 9 months to 1 year, and (6) 1 to 2 years. Surgical and medical complications of these cohorts were compared with those of a control cohort of patients who underwent bilateral RCR >2 years apart using a regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 11,079 patients who underwent bilateral RCR were identified. Patients who underwent single-stage bilateral arthroscopic RCR experienced higher rates of revision RCR (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; P < .0001), reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) (OR, 2.47; P < .0001), and postoperative infection (OR, 2.18; P = .007) in addition to higher rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) (OR, 1.78; P = .031) and emergency department visits (OR, 1.51; P = .002) compared with the control group. Patients who underwent bilateral RCR with a <3-month interval had higher rates of revision surgery (OR, 1.56; P = .003), RTSA (OR, 1.89; P = .002), and lysis of adhesions (OR, 2.31; P < .0001) in addition to increased rates of VTE (OR, 1.92; P = .015) and emergency department visits (OR, 1.62; P < .0001) compared with the control group. There were no differences in any surgical or medical complications when surgeries were staged by >=3 months compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Patients with Medicare undergoing single-stage and staged bilateral RCR who had the second repair within 3 months had significantly higher rates of multiple medical and surgical complications compared with patients waiting >2 years between procedures.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the prevalence of rotator cuff tears and describe the profile of reoperated patients, causes of repeated tendon tears, tear evolution and range of times between surgical procedures. Method This was a cross-sectional study involving 604 surgical procedures performed at two regional referral hospitals between January 2006 and December 2012. After approval by the ethics committee, data describing the patients' epidemiological profile were gathered at a single time, using Cofield's classification to measure the extent of the tears, all of which underwent arthroscopic surgery. The data were entered into Epi Info 3.5.3 and were analyzed using SPSS version 18.0. Results Among the 604 surgical procedures, females were affected in more cases (351; 58.1%). When the dominant limb was the right limb, it was affected in 90% of the cases (p < 0.05). The supraspinatus tendon was affected in 574 cases (95%) and the tears were of medium size in 300 cases (49.7%). Eighteen reoperations were performed (2.98%) and the upper right limb was the most affected (66,6%). The cause was non-traumatic in 12 patients. The repeated tears were mostly smaller (44%), and the length of time between the two surgical procedures ranged from 6 to 298 weeks. Conclusion Female gender, smaller extent in the second procedure and non-traumatic cause were found in most of the cases analyzed. © 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Ortopedia e Traumatologia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been no report to date regarding retraction patterns of delaminated rotator cuff tears. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and tearing patterns of delamination and repair integrity after the dual-layer repair of delaminated cuff tears. METHODS/DESIGN: A consecutive series of 64 patients with posterosuperior rotator cuff tears underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair from August 2011 to September 2012. Among the patients, 53 who received either dual-layer double-row (DLDR) repair or dual-layer suture bridge (DLSB) repair and 11 who received a single-layer repair were evaluated. The mean follow-up period after surgery was 26.5 months. The retraction direction of the deep and superficial layers was analyzed, and the integrity of the repaired constructs was determined in 37 patients through magnetic resonance imaging at a mean of 12.1 months after surgery. RESULTS: The incidence of delamination was 82.8 %. Posteromedial retraction of the deep and superficial layers was observed in 98.1 and 88.5 % of cases, respectively. The Constant score and UCLA score increased preoperatively to postoperatively, showing no significant differences between the dual-layer repair group and single-layer repair group. Retear was found in two (7.6 %) patients in the dual-layer repair group and three (27.2 %) patients in the single-layer repair group (p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Differential rotator cuff repair strategies are needed to address rotator cuff tears, since recent studies have changed our concept of rotator cuff tears. We have focused on three areas: incidence, retraction patterns, and clinical outcomes. The incidence of delamination was extremely high. Both the superficial layer and deep layer were mainly retracted posteromedially. The retraction of the deep layer and superficial layer may be affected by the infraspinatus. Dual-layer rotator cuff repair based on the retraction pattern of delamination is recommended for improvement of repair integrity and of clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: Acromioclavicular osteoarthritis and rotator cuff tears are commonly coincident. Purpose: To determine the rate of subsequent distal clavicle excision (DCE) when rotator cuff repair (RCR) is performed without DCE and the risk factors for subsequent DCE after RCR. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The operative logs of 2 surgeons from 2007 to 2016 were retrospectively reviewed for all patients who underwent RCR with or without DCE. Preoperative demographic data, symptoms, physical examination, and standardized outcomes (visual analog scale for pain, Simple Shoulder Test, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score) were noted. Acromioclavicular (AC) arthritis was classified on preoperative radiographs. The rate of subsequent surgery on the AC joint was determined via chart review, and univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine risk factors for revision. Results: In total, 894 patients underwent isolated RCR, and 46 underwent concomitant RCR and DCE. On retrospective chart review, of those who underwent isolated RCR, the revision rate for any reason was 7.5% (67 patients), and the rate of subsequent AC surgery was 1.1% (10 patients). Preoperatively, 88% of the total cohort was considered to have a radiographically normal AC joint. On multivariate analysis of patients who underwent isolated RCR, the risk factors for subsequent AC surgery included preoperative tenderness to palpation at the AC joint (10% vs 63%, P < .001), female sex (35% vs 80%, P < .001), and surgery on the dominant side (60% vs 100%, P = .002). On multivariate analysis, these 3 factors explained 50% of the variance in revision AC surgery. When these 3 factors were present in combination, there was a 40% rate of revision AC surgery. Conclusion: This records review found that 10 of 894 (1.1%) rotator cuff repairs underwent subsequent distal clavicle resection. Risk factors for subsequent DCE included tenderness to palpation at the AC joint, female sex, and surgery on the dominant side, with subsequent DCE performed in 40% of cases with a combination of these 3 factors. Because the duration of follow-up was short and the number of reoperations small, some caution is recommended in interpreting these results, as the analyses may be underpowered.

AB  - Background Evidence on the ideal rehabilitation program for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is lacking. Most data and results are conflicting with no consensus made. This study aims to compare between an early aggressive program with immediate postoperative range-of-motion (ROM) exercises and a more conservative program with early restriction of motion in Hong Kong Chinese population. Materials and methods We retrospectively evaluated 37 arthroscopic rotator cuff repair cases who underwent a standardized delayed rehabilitation protocol of immobilization for 4 weeks to 6 weeks before formal passive ROM exercises. Patients were evaluated at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the surgery, for which they would be tested on passive forward flexion (FF). They were categorized as "stiff" if FF was less than 100degree. Constant score, Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score, and isometric abduction power deficit percentage were parameters to assess the functional outcome, and they were obtained in all of the patients' last follow-up assessments. Results Two cases (5.4%) are considered "stiff" 6 months after the surgery. At 1 year, the stiffness in both cases resolved, resulting in 0% rate of stiffness. The mean FF at 1 year was 153.33 +/- 20.15, which is comparable to the literature. Two cases (5.4%) of clinical retear occurred. Mean Constant score at the latest follow-up was 62.4 +/- 13.2. Mean VAS score was 1.1 +/- 1.8 at rest and 2.8 +/- 2.0 on exertion. Mean DASH score was 25.3 +/- 21.9. Mean isometric abduction power deficit was 42.7% +/- 0.2%. Discussion Historically, due to concerns on long-term stiffness, an early aggressive postoperative rehabilitation protocol was used. We found that an early restriction of ROM with 4 weeks to 6 weeks of immobilization did not lead to long-term stiffness and functional disadvantage. This includes patients with stiffness even before the operations. Conclusions Immobilization for 4 weeks to 6 weeks after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair does not result in long-term stiffness and may even be beneficial to cuff tendon healing. Copyright © 2017

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess tendon healing and clinical results of rotator cuff tears (RCTs) repaired arthroscopically in patients aged 65 years or older. METHODS: Between January 2001 and December 2004, 88 patients with a mean age of 70 years (range, 65 to 85 years) had arthroscopic RCT repair. The repair was performed on 54 women (61%). The dominant arm was involved in 72 patients (82%). RCT included more than 2 tendons in 45 cases. Functional outcomes were assessed by use of the Constant score and Simple Shoulder Test. Tendon healing was estimated by use of a computed tomography (CT) arthrogram, which was obtained 6 months postoperatively, and was classified into 3 categories: stage 1, watertight and anatomic healing; stage 2, watertight and partial healing; and stage 3, not watertight and retear. RESULTS: The mean duration of follow-up was 41 months (range, 24 to 77 months). The mean clinical outcome scores all improved significantly at the time of the final follow-up (P < .01). Computed tomography arthrogram imaging showed 27 shoulders with a stage 1 repair, 20 with a stage 2 repair, and 34 with a stage 3 repair. The retear rate was 42% (34 of 81). The patients with tendon healing stage 1 or 2 had a significantly superior functional outcome in terms of overall scores and strength compared with the stage 3 repairs (P < .01). In our study we had 39 isolated supraspinatus tears (small or medium tears); 11 (28.9%) had a retear (stage 3). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair in patients aged 65 years or older can yield tendon healing resulting in significant functional improvement. Our data suggest that arthroscopic repair can be considered successful for the older patient specifically when the tear is limited to the supraspinatus tendon. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare pain patterns and identify factors associated with residual shoulder pain after rotator cuff repairs using double-row and single-row techniques. METHODS: A cohort study was performed using patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs at our center in 2015. Patients were allocated according to the repair technique into an single-row (SR) group or a double-row (DR) group. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for pain were assessed at 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after surgery. Functional and radiographic assessments were performed at least 24 months postoperatively. The proportion of patients with residual pain and factors associated with residual shoulder pain (VAS > 0 at the final follow-up) were analyzed in both groups. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled in the SR group, and 53 were enrolled in the DR group. The DR group appeared to have higher levels of pain 1 week (P < 0.001) and 3 months (P = 0.041) postoperatively, while at other time points, the pain intensity of the two groups was comparable. Fourteen (26.4%) and 25 (48.1%) patients in the DR and the SR groups, respectively, developed residual shoulder pain, (P = 0.022; RR 1.82). The univariate analysis and multiple regression revealed that a poorer quality of tendon tissue is related to residual pain in the SR group, whereas tendon retraction is associated with residual pain in the DR group. The rate of re-tear was similar between the two groups and between patients with and without residual pain. CONCLUSIONS: The DR repair technique results in a greater intensity of pain than that of SR repair during the first 3 months after surgery; however, patients who underwent DR repair presented a significantly lower proportion of residual shoulder pain and better tendon quality after 2 years. Poorer tendon quality and larger tendon retraction as determined intraoperatively were risk factors for residual pain. These results highlight the necessity of promoting healing on the grounds of residual pain prevention. Level of evidence: Ii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most patients return successfully to shoulder involving sports or activity after rotator cuff repairs. It has not been decided yet whether postoperative participation in shoulder activity adds to the risk of retear. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose was to verify whether patients who participate in shoulder activities after rotator cuff repair have a higher risk of structural failure than nonactive patients and to investigate the relationship between postoperative shoulder function and tendon integrity in active and nonactive patients. The hypotheses were that (1) active patients have a higher retear rate than nonactive patients and (2) structural failure is associated with worse functional outcomes in active patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A cohort study was performed using 145 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair from 2015 to 2017. Functional assessments and magnetic resonance imaging were performed at least 24 months postoperatively. Shoulder activities since 6 months after surgery were rated in 4 categories (sports, job, activities of daily life, and weight of general lifting) as sedentary, light, moderate, or strenuous. The activity level of each patient was defined by the highest rated category. Patients who were involved in light, moderate, and strenuous activity were identified as active for the present study, and the rest were defined as sedentary. The proportion of retears between groups and the functional conditions between retorn and intact tendons were compared. RESULTS: A total of 48 patients were enrolled in the active group, and 97 were enrolled in the sedentary group. The active group demonstrated a significantly higher retear rate than the sedentary group (27.1% vs 11.3%, respectively; P = .016; risk ratio, 2.39 [95% CI, 1.16-4.93]). In the active group, patients with retears showed higher visual analog scale scores for pain, decreased abduction strength, and lower shoulder functional scores (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Fudan University Shoulder Score, and Constant-Murley score) than those with healed tendons, whereas in the sedentary group, functional outcomes were generally similar across patients with and without retears. CONCLUSION: Shoulder activity after the early postoperative period was associated with a high risk of retears in patients who underwent rotator cuff repair. A correlation between inhibited function and structural failure was detected but only in active patients, while sedentary patients with retears retained functional improvements similar to those with intact tendons.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of rotator cuff repair in the presence of a greater tuberosity cyst (GTC) using a transosseous repair technique. Method(s): This study included patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff tear repair with a transosseous technique and were evaluated clinically and by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 1 year. The inclusion criteria were based on the results of preoperative MRI and were as follows: patients identified as having a repairable full-thickness rotator cuff tear associated with the presence of cystic changes at the tendon insertion site of the greater tuberosity, defined as a GTC involving the footprint area of the torn tendon (supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus tendons). Result(s): We evaluated 25 patients. The mean preoperative and postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores were 39.48 (P =.530) and 84.64 (P =.035), respectively; Constant shoulder scores, 38.96 (P <.005) and 80.28 (P =.425), respectively; and University of California-Los Angeles shoulder rating scale scores, 10.6 (P =.045) and 29.04 (P =.315), respectively. The GTC mapping system was easily adopted in all the MRI examinations independently from the quality of the images. The GTCs were mostly located in the superficial anterolateral section of the humeral head and in both the posterolateral sections (superficial and deep). Conclusion(s): Arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair led to significant mid-term improvement and satisfactory subjective outcomes with low complication and failure rates in this study. The GTC mapping system could be useful to evaluate GTCs and to aid surgeons in the choice of the best surgical technique. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional and anatomic results of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and to analyze the factors affecting the integrity of arthroscopically repaired rotator cuff tears of the shoulder. METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine consecutive shoulders that underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, had a postoperative MRI evaluation and were followed for at least two years were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 57.6 years (range, 38 to 74 years) and the mean follow-up period was 39 months (range, 24 to 83 months). RESULTS: The rotator cuff was completely healed in 131 (77.5%) out of 169 shoulders and recurrent tears occurred in 38 shoulders (22.5%). At the last follow-up visit, the mean score for pain during motion was 1.53 (range, 0 to 4) in the completely healed group and 1.59 (range, 0 to 4) in the group with recurrent tears (p = 0.092). The average elevation strength was 7.87 kg (range, 4.96 to 11.62 kg) and 5.25 kg (range, 4.15 to 8.13 kg) and the mean University of California at Los Angeles score was 30.96 (range, 26 to 35) and 30.64 (range, 23 to 34), respectively (p < 0.001, p = 0.798). The complete healing rate was 87.8% in the group less than 50 years of age (49 shoulders), 79.4% in the group over 51 years but less than 60 years of age (68 shoulders), and 65.4% in the group over 61 years of age (52 shoulders, p = 0.049); it was 96.7% in the group with small-sized tears (30 shoulders), 87.3% in the group with medium-sized tears (71 shoulders), and 58.8% in the group with large-sized or massive tears (68 shoulders, p = 0.009). All of the rotator cuffs with a global fatty degeneration index of greater than two preoperatively had recurrent tears. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears led to a relatively high rate of recurrent defects. However, the minimum two-year follow up demonstrated excellent pain relief and improvement in the ability to perform the activities of daily living, despite the structural failures. The factors affecting tendon healing were the patient's age, the size and extent of the tear, and the presence of fatty degeneration in the rotator cuff muscle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suture bridge repair has been recognized to have superior biomechanical characteristics, as shown in previous biomechanical studies. However, it is not clear whether the tendon heals better in vivo after suture bridge repair. PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical results and repair integrity after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using a suture bridge technique for patients with rotator cuff tears. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three shoulders (120 patients) that underwent arthroscopic suture bridge repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tear were enrolled for this study. The mean duration of follow-up was 25.2 months (range, 16-34 months). The postoperative repair integrity was analyzed with use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 87 shoulders. According to the retear patterns on postoperative MRI, the cases were divided into type 1 (failure at the original repair site) or 2 (failure around the medial row). RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score improved from the preoperative mean of 13.2 points to 29.7 points (P < .001). The rotator cuff was completely healed in 58 (66.7%) of the 87 shoulders, and there was a recurrent tear in 29 shoulders (33.3%). The incidence of retear tended to increase with age older than 60 years at the time of surgery (P = .002). When there was a larger intraoperative tear, the rate of retear was also higher (P = .002). When the severity of preoperative fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles was higher, there was a greater chance of a recurrent tear (P < .001). The retear patterns on postoperative MRI in 29 shoulders with recurrent failures were classified as type 1 in 12 shoulders (41.4%) and type 2 in 17 shoulders (58.6%). The preoperative cuff tear size did not have an influence on retear patterns (P = .236), but the percentage of type 1 retear increased with the severity of fatty degeneration or muscle atrophy (P = .041, .023). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic suture bridge repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears led to a relatively high rate of recurrent defects. However, the mean 25-month follow-up demonstrated excellent pain relief and improvement in the ability to perform the activities of daily living, despite the structural failures. The factors affecting tendon healing were the patient's age, the size and extent of the tear, and the presence of fatty degeneration in the rotator cuff muscle. The retear in cases with a suture bridge technique tended to be more frequently at the musculotendinous junction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical effect of sustained hyperglycemia on tendon-to-bone healing after rotator cuff repair has not been well characterized. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and structural outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and to determine the effect of a diabetic phenotype on tendon-to-bone healing. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated a total of 335 shoulders that were available for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation at least 6 months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using the suture-bridge technique with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Only patients who had medium- to large-sized tears with supraspinatus of fatty infiltration <2 and no or mild atrophy were enrolled in this study. There were 271 nondiabetic patients (group A) and 64 diabetic patients (group B). The mean age at the time of operation for groups A and B was 57.7 and 58.2 years, respectively, and the mean duration of follow-up after surgery was 27.8 and 24.8 months, respectively. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to pain at rest and during motion (P = .212 and .336, respectively). Both groups reported statistically significant improvement in Constant and Shoulder Rating Scale of the University of California at Los Angeles scores (P = .323 and .241, respectively), but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. In assessing the repair integrity with postoperative MRI scans, 39 of 271 cases in group A (14.4%) and 23 of 64 cases in group B (35.9%) had retears, and the difference between the 2 groups was statistically significant (P < .001). In analyzing the retear rates according to the severity of sustained hyperglycemia in group B, retear was found in 16 of 37 (43.2%) uncontrolled diabetic patients with poor glycemic control (>=7.0% of preoperative serum glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] levels) and in 7 of 27 (25.9%) controlled diabetic patients (<7.0%) (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Pain, range of motion, and function all significantly improved after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using the suture-bridge technique, regardless of the presence of diabetes. However, sustained hyperglycemia increased the possibility of anatomic failure at the repaired cuff. In diabetic patients, an effective glycemic control was associated with better rate of healing after rotator cuff repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anterior rotator cable is critical in force transmission of the rotator cuff. However, few clinical studies have examined the correlation between the integrity of the anterior supraspinatus tendon and surgical outcomes in patients with rotator cuff tears. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and structural outcomes of the arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with and without anterior disruption of the supraspinatus tendon. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: One hundred eighty-one shoulders available for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at least 6 months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, with a minimum 1-year follow-up, were enrolled. The anterior attachment of the rotator cable was disrupted in 113 shoulders (group A) and intact in 68 shoulders (group B). The mean age at the time of surgery in groups A and B was 59.6 and 59.2 years, respectively, and the mean follow-up period was 24.2 and 25.1 months, respectively. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in the preoperative tear size and pattern and muscle fatty degeneration between the 2 groups ( P = .004, P = .008, and P < .001, respectively). At final follow-up, the mean visual analog scale (VAS) for pain score during motion was 1.31 +/- 0.98 and 1.24 +/- 0.90 in groups A and B, respectively ( P = .587). The mean Constant score was 77.5 +/- 11.2 and 78.0 +/- 11.9 points in groups A and B, respectively ( P = .875). The mean University of California, Los Angeles score was 30.5 +/- 4.1 and 31.0 +/- 3.0 points in groups A and B, respectively ( P = .652). In assessing the repair integrity on postoperative MRI, the retear rate was 23.9% and 14.7% in groups A and B, respectively ( P = .029). CONCLUSION: Irrespective of involvement in the anterior attachment of the rotator cable, the mean 24-month follow-up demonstrated excellent pain relief and improvement in the ability to perform activities of daily living after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. However, tears with anterior disruption of the rotator cable showed a significantly larger and more complex tear pattern and more advanced fatty degeneration. Additionally, the retear rate was significantly higher in patients with a tear involving the anterior attachment of the rotator cable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the integrity and functional outcomes of rotator cuff tear after performing the double-pulley suture bridge (DPSB) repair technique according to the tear size by using serial ultrasonographic examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 41 consecutive arthroscopic rotator repairs using the DPSB technique. The average follow-up was 28 months. We completed the serial ultrasonographic examinations and compared the results with the functional outcome using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Constant score, the Korean Shoulder Scoring (KSS) system, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score. RESULTS: The overall retear rate was 19.5% (8 of 41), comprising 50% (2 of 4) for massive tears, 18% (2 of 11) for large tears, 17% (4 of 23) for medium tears, and no failures for small tears (0 of 3). The retear rate was 17.6% (6 of 34) after complete repair and 28.6% (2 of 7) after repair with gap formation. Seventy-five percent (6 of 8) of retears were identified within 6 months after operation and 25% (2 of 8) were identified more than 1 year after repair. The functional outcomes of the intact group and the retear group according to the ASES score, the Constant score, the KSS, and the UCLA score were 96, 93, 94, and 33, and 90, 82, 87, and 31, respectively (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The overall retear rate after DPSB repair was 19.5% with 2 time periods of retear. The outcome improved independent of the tear size and the cuff integrity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate clinical outcomes, maintenance of repair integrity, and retear rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a suture bridge technique among patients with medium, large, and massive rotator cuff tears. METHODS: We evaluated 147 patients who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Clinical and functional evaluations were performed with the Constant and University of California-Los Angeles scores. All patients were confirmed to have magnetic resonance imaging evidence of tendon healing at least 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The average postoperative time to follow-up magnetic resonance imaging was 23.4 months (range, 12-48 months). A total of 25 (17.0%) retears were observed. All clinical outcome scores were improved significantly at follow-up. Larger intraoperative tear sizes were correlated with higher retear rates. The incidence of retear was also higher in cases in which the preoperative fatty degeneration grade was higher. The incidence of retear increased with age and in the heavy worker group (e.g., farmers, carriers, car mechanics) but was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a suture bridge technique yields improvements in clinical outcome measures and a relatively high degree of patient satisfaction despite the fact that repair integrity is not maintained in many cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of postoperative stiffness after rotator cuff repair and to evaluate postoperative stiffness with respect to its risk factors and its influence on outcome. METHODS: We included 288 patients (mean age, 59.5 +/- 8.4 years) who underwent surgical repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Postoperative range of motion was measured serially 3 months, 6 months, and at least 1 year (mean, 22.8 +/- 13.1 months) after surgery. Simultaneously, functional outcome was evaluated using the pain visual analog scale (VAS) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and cuff healing was confirmed by computed tomography arthrography or ultrasonography at least 1 year after surgery (mean, 13.5 +/- 2.7 months). We calculated the serial incidence of postoperative stiffness at each follow-up visit, assessed the risk factors for postoperative stiffness at each period, and then evaluated the correlation of stiffness with cuff healing and functional outcome. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative stiffness was 18.6% (54/288) at 3 months, 2.8% (8/288) at 6 months, and 6.6% (19/288) at final follow-up. Mean age was higher in the stiffness group at all times (all P < .05). Preoperative stiffness affected postoperative stiffness only at 3 months (P = .04). Larger tear size, higher grade of fatty infiltration (FI), and open or mini-open surgery were correlated with stiffness only at final follow-up (all P < .05). More patients with final postoperative stiffness showed retear (17/19, 89.5%) compared with those without stiffness (49/269, 18.2%, P < .001), and retear was an independent factor for late postoperative stiffness. Pain VAS was higher in the stiffness group at 3 months and final follow-up (all P < .01), and ASES score was lower in the stiffness group only at final follow-up (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Old age is an important risk factor for postoperative stiffness throughout the follow-up period. Early postoperative stiffness is affected by preoperative stiffness. However, late postoperative stiffness, especially newly developed stiffness, is closely related to retear and significantly worse functional outcome after surgical repair, even though we could not find the cause-effect relation. When a patient complains about newly developed stiffness in the late postoperative period, retear should be considered. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrophy of rotator cuff muscles has been considered an irreversible phenomenon. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether atrophy is truly irreversible after rotator cuff repair. METHODS: We measured supraspinatus muscle atrophy of 191 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and postoperative multidetector computed tomography images, taken at least 1 year after operation. The occupation ratio was calculated using Photoshop CS3 software. We compared the change between pre- and postoperative occupation ratios after modifying the preoperative occupation ratio. In addition, possible relationship between various clinical factors and the change of atrophy, and between the change of atrophy and cuff integrity after surgical repair were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean occupation ratio was significantly increased postoperatively from 0.44 +/- 0.17 to 0.52 +/- 0.17 (p < 0.001). Among 191 patients, 81 (42.4%) showed improvement of atrophy (more than a 10% increase in occupation ratio) and 33 (17.3%) worsening (more than a 10% decrease). Various clinical factors such as age tear size, or initial degree of atrophy did not affect the change of atrophy. However, the change of atrophy was related to repair integrity: cuff healing failure rate of 48.5% (16 of 33) in worsened atrophy; and 22.2% (18 of 81) in improved atrophy (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The supraspinatus muscle atrophy as measured by occupation ratio could be improved postoperatively in case of successful cuff repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to report the outcome of patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) and to determine the factors associated with return to work and activity. MATERIALS: Three hundred sixty-five patients who underwent ARCR were prospectively evaluated. The cohort was divided into 2 groups based on clinical results at 6 months. Group A consisted of patients who were considered to have a satisfactory outcome based on return to their previous professional or spare-time activities. Group B consisted of patients with an unsatisfactory outcome based on a lack of return to normal work or activities. RESULTS: Of the patients, 305 had a satisfactory outcome (group A) and 60 were categorized as having an unsatisfactory outcome (group B). On multivariate analysis, preoperative factors associated with group B included female gender and heavy manual labor. Postoperative bursitis on ultrasound at 6 months was associated with being in group B. Lack of tendon healing was not associated with group B. However, if a patient without healing had persistent pain at 6 months, the pain persisted at 9 months. CONCLUSION: ARCR is an effective procedure that leads to significant improvement in pain, function, and tendon healing in most cases. However, in 1 of 5 cases, patients were unable to resume normal activity at 6 months postoperatively. Persistent limitation at 6 months was associated with female gender, heavy manual workers, and the presence of postoperative persistent bursitis.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The present study reports an original independent double-row technique for arthroscopic posterosuperior rotator cuff repair. Clinical and ultrasound results were assessed at 6-month follow-up in a single-center series of 78 patients with a mean age of 57years. Constant score improved from 55 to 73 (P<0.05). Seven patients (9%) had re-tear: 6 tendon avulsions from the bone and 1 tear at the myotendinous junction. This repair technique provided a high rate of tendon healing on the bone, with a lower rate of complications than with traditional double-row repair techniques. Level of evidence: Ii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early repair of isolated supraspinatus tears could prevent further deterioration of the rotator cuff; however, there is no consensus on the management of such tears because of a lack of long-term outcome studies. The purposes of this study were to report the 10-year outcomes of isolated supraspinatus repairs and to investigate the factors that favor healing and recovery. METHODS: We retrieved the records of all 511 patients who, in 2003, underwent repair of full-thickness isolated supraspinatus tears, performed by 15 surgeons at 15 centers. In 2014, the patients were asked to return for evaluation at a minimum follow-up of 10 years. One hundred and eighty-eight patients could not be reached, and 35 were excluded because they had a reoperation (17 had a retear, 7 had conversion to an arthroplasty, and 11 had other causes). A total of 288 patients (50% were men) who had a mean age (and standard deviation) at index surgery of 56.5 +/- 8.3 years (range, 32 to 77 years) were evaluated clinically, and 210 of them were also evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Thirty shoulders (10.4%) had complications, including stiffness (20 shoulders), infection (1 shoulder), and other complications (9 shoulders). The total Constant score improved from a mean of 51.8 +/- 13.6 points (range, 19 to 87 points) preoperatively to 77.7 +/- 12.1 points (range, 37 to 100 points) at 10 years. At the 10-year follow-up evaluation, the mean Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) was 84.9 +/- 14.8 (range, 20 to 100), and the mean Simple Shoulder Test (SST) was 10.1 +/- 2.2 (range, 3 to 12). Of the 210 shoulders evaluated using MRI, the repair integrity was Sugaya type I in 26 shoulders (12%), type II in 85 (41%), type III in 59 (28%), type IV in 27 (13%), and type V in 13 (6%). The total Constant score at the final follow-up was significantly associated with tendon healing (p < 0.005) and was inversely associated with preoperative fatty infiltration (p < 0.001). Neither the surgical approach nor the preoperative retraction influenced the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Repairs of isolated supraspinatus tears maintained considerable improvement in clinical and radiographic outcomes at 10 years. Preoperative fatty infiltration and postoperative retear have a significantly detrimental effect on the long-term functional outcome of rotator cuff repair. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - Background: This study evaluated the clinical and structural outcome 20 years after repair of isolated supraspinatus tendon tears. We hypothesized that the results would deteriorate over time. Material(s) and Method(s): For this retrospective multicenter study, 137 patients were recalled for a clinical and imaging assessment. Six patients (4.3%) had died from unrelated causes, 52 (38.0%) were lost to follow-up, and 13 (9.5%) had undergone reoperations. This left 66 patients for clinical evaluation. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging were additionally performed for 45 patients, allowing assessment of osteoarthritis, tendon healing, fatty infiltration (FI), and muscle atrophy. Result(s): The Constant Score (CS) improved from 51.5 +/- 14.1 points preoperatively to 71 points (P <.05) with a mean Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV) of 77.2% +/- 22%. Tendon discontinuity (Sugaya IV-V) was present in 19 of 45 patients (42 %), and there was advanced FI (Goutallier III-IV) of the supraspinatus in 12 (27%) and of the infraspinatus muscle in 16 (35%). Supraspinatus atrophy was present in 12 patients (28%), advanced arthritis in 6, and cuff tear arthropathy in 12 (30%). The CS and SSV were significantly inferior for shoulders with FI of stages III to IV (P <.05). The CS was lower in cuff tear arthropathy and correlated with infraspinatus FI. Conclusion(s): At 20 years after surgical repair of isolated supraspinatus tears, the clinical outcome remains significantly above the preoperative state. FI of the infraspinatus is the most influential factor on long-term clinical outcome. Copyright © 2018

AB  - PURPOSE: The critical shoulder angle (CSA) has been implicated as a potential risk factor for failure following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the clinical usefulness of this measurement. Given these discrepancies and limited comparisons to clinical outcomes, the aim of the current study was to determine whether higher CSAs correlated with an increased retear rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and to determine if any association between CSA and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) exists. It was hypothesized that there would be no correlation between CSA and retear rate or PROs after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: A total of 164 patients who underwent arthroscopic RCR were retrospectively reviewed. CSA was measured for each patient. Patients were then divided into a retear group of 18 patients and a non-retear group of 146 patients. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including PROMIS 10 score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Brophy score, and visual analog pain scores (VAS) were recorded post-operatively. RESULTS: The average CSA was 31.2 +/- 4.5degree for the retear group and 32.2 +/- 4.7degree for the non-retear group (n.s.). No correlations were found between CSA and PROMIS score (n.s.), ASES score (n.s.), Brophy score (n.s.), or VAS (n.s.). CONCLUSION: Critical shoulder angle had no correlation to retear rate or patient-reported outcomes. CSA should not be used as a clinical predictor to assess rotator cuff retear risk after arthroscopic RCR. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to assess the changes occurring over time in the MRI appearance of repaired rotator cuff tendons and to correlate MRI appearance with clinical outcomes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: MRI examinations were performed on 40 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after arthroscopic repair. Preoperative scans were assessed for size of tear. Postoperative scans were evaluated for size of footprint, tendon thickness, signal intensity of the repaired tendon, and presence of full-thickness tear. Footprint and tendon thickness were graded from 1 to 4 according to percentage of normal. Tendon signal intensity was graded from 1 to 4 on the basis of the length of abnormal tendon. A composite score of footprint, tendon thickness, and tendon signal intensity was used to compare overall tendon appearance relative to the intact tendon. Rasch analysis was used to transform ordinal scale data into interval scale data. Using interval scale data, MRI findings were correlated to shoulder strength and the Constant-Murley score of clinical outcome. RESULTS: Four recurrent tendon tears occurred during the first postoperative year. Tendons appeared most disorganized compared with native tendon 3 months after surgery. Twenty-four of 36 intact tendons showed a decreased tendon score between 6 weeks and 3 months. There was considerable variability in tendon appearance among patients. There was no correlation between MRI appearance and clinical outcome score. CONCLUSION: MRI appearance of the repaired tendon changes over time but does not correlate with function or predict clinical outcomes at 1 year after surgery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff have shown have shown encouraging clinical results. However, few authors have assessed integrity of repair with ultrasound. The presence of re-rupture by ultrasonography in a rotator cuff repair may not relate to the patient's functional status. OBJECTIVE: We used ultrasonography to assess the prevalence of re-rupture in rotator cuff repairs and its clinical relevance with minimum 1 year postoperatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evidence level IV (Case series). We evaluated 27 shoulders that underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Clinical evaluation was performed using UCLA functional scale, visual analogue scale (UCLA, VAS). Post-operative ultrasound was performed at least 1 year postoperatively. Statistical analysis was done with the SPSS 11.0 software. RESULTS: We examined 27 shoulders, mean age 56.4 (41-78), mean postoperative follow-up 19.6 (12 m-88 m). Clinical assessment with UCLA functional scale results were: good-excellent (77.4%); fair (22.2%). VAS results showed that 44.4% reported VAS of 0; in the range of 1-3 VAS was 55.5% of the patients. Ultrasound evaluation showed no injury in 37%; partial lesion 51.9%, and a total lesion 11.1%. Thirty-three % of the patients with VAS of 0 showed no injury when evaluated by ultrasonography, injury by ultrasound 33.3% with VAS (1-3) 22.2%. UCLA (good-excellent) without injury by ultrasound 33.3% with a 44.4% degree of injury, UCLA (Fair) without injury 3.7%, with some degree of lesion 18.5%. Results no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In our series, we find that integrity of rotator cuff postoperative ultrasound, it has no effect on the functional status of patients with postoperative follow-up of at least 1 year, with UCLA and VAS.

AB  - The aim of this study was to document the incidence of postoperative shoulder stiffness (SS) after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and evaluate the role of risk factors for its development. Seventy-five consecutive patients that underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were included. The incidence of postoperative SS was prospectively investigated and the presence of 20 potential risk factors was documented retrospectively. The incidence of post-operative SS was 10.4%. All patients were women, and sex was significantly associated to pathology development (p=0.0067). The presence of gastroesophageal diseases was found to be significantly associated with post-operative SS development (p=0.0046). A significant association between the occurrence of post-operative SS and the presence of gastroesophageal diseases was identified. This finding, not yet reported in literature, deserves further investigation. The incidence of postoperative SS fell among previously reported ranges, with females significantly more affected than men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative shoulder stiffness (SS) after arthroscopic rotator cuff (RC) repair has been reported with a variable incidence, and numerous preoperative risk factors have been described. This prospective study aimed to document the incidence of postoperative SS and to evaluate the role of preoperative risk factors in the development of this complication, with a special focus on the role of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). METHODS: Preoperative risk factors for SS were prospectively evaluated in 237 consecutive patients undergoing arthroscopic single-row RC repair. The presence of GERD was evaluated with the GerdQ diagnostic tool. Postoperative SS was diagnosed according to the criteria described by Brislin et al in 2007. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative SS was 8.02%. The presence of GERD was significantly associated with the development of postoperative SS (odds ratio [OR], 5.265; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.657-1.731; P = .005). Older age (OR, 0.896; 95% CI, 0.847-0.949; P < .001), male sex (OR, 0.126; 95% CI, 0.0252-0.632; P = .012), and number of pregnancies (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.228-0.967; P = .040) emerged as protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of GERD significantly influences the development of postoperative SS after arthroscopic single-row RC repair. An underlying aspecific proinflammatory condition, characterized by increased expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor beta, and disorders in retinoid metabolism are hypotheses that could explain this previously unknown association. The documented incidence of postoperative SS falls within previously reported ranges, with women being significantly more affected than men.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the national trends in arthroscopic and open rotator cuff repair surgery and the associated demographics, complications, and risk factors specific to each procedure. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) dataset between the years 2007 and 2018. Patients were identified using Common Procedural Terminology codes for open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Variables collected including basic demographics, procedural, and outcome specific variables as available through the NSQIP repository. Appropriate statistical measures were used to compare the groups, with the chi<sup>2</sup> test used for categorical variables and t test for continuous variables. RESULTS: The arthroscopic cohort comprised 39,013 patients; the open group consisted of 8,664. Reported arthroscopic and open cases increased significantly between 2007 and 2018 from 135 to 7,269 and 65 to 1,168, respectively. Average operative time for arthroscopic procedure was 89 minutes and 76 minutes for open. The open group consisted of a slightly greater percentage of smokers, 18.3% versus 15.2%, and patients with diabetes, 18.2% versus 15.9%, both of which were statistically significant (P < .001). Open cases had an odds ratio of 3.05 for superficial infections and 7.40 for deep infections, both of which were statistically significant (P < .001). The open cohort also had an odds ratio of 1.71 for unplanned readmissions when compared with the arthroscopic cohort, which was also statistically significant (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: According to the NSQIP database, the increase in arthroscopic procedures is significantly outpacing the increase in open procedures during this study period, which matches the trends seen in previous studies. Patients with diabetes and who smoke also represent a greater risk group for postoperative complications when undergoing open surgery. These findings suggest that perhaps the decision to pursue one technique over the other may be influenced both by provider preference and patient-related factors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective comparative trial.

AB  - PURPOSE: To define and compare the incidence and risk factors for short-term complications after arthroscopic and open rotator cuff repair (RTCR), and to identify independent risk factors for complications after RTCR. METHODS: All patients who underwent open or arthroscopic RTCR from 2005 to 2013 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Short-term complications were categorized as surgical, medical, mortality, and unplanned 30-day readmission. Univariate analysis allowed the comparison of patient demographics and comorbidities. Propensity score matching was used to control for demographic differences between arthroscopic and open RTCR patient groups. Independent risk factors for complication were identified using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 11,314 RTCRs were identified (24% open, 76% arthroscopic). The mean operative time for open RTCR was 78 minutes compared with 91 minutes for arthroscopic repairs (P < .001). The overall complication rate was 1.3%, with the highest complication unplanned return to the operating room (41 patients, 0.36%). The 30-day readmission was 1.16% (76/6,560 patients) and the mortality rate was 0.03% (3 patients). Total 30-day complications in the propensity-score-matched patient group were higher after open versus arthroscopic repair (1.79% vs 1.17%; P = .006). The overall infection rate after RTCR was 0.56%, with deep wound infection higher in the open repair patient group (P = .003). Multivariate analysis identified age >65 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.3), operative time >90 minutes (OR 1.5; CI 1.1-2.1), and open RTCR (OR 1.6; CI 1.1-2.3) as independent risk factors for complications. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term complications after RTCR are rare. Total complications are higher after open RTCR in propensity-matched patient groups and in multivariate analysis. Risk factors for complications include patient age >65, operative time >90 minutes, and open repair. Open RTCR is associated with an increased risk of surgical infections. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare rehabilitation protocol and operative treatment in a population of patients with a diagnosis of small to medium rotator cuff tears (<=3 cm), the null hypothesis being that there would been no difference in terms of clinical outcomes and patient's satisfaction between the rehabilitation protocol and the surgical treatment. METHODS: Patients with small to medium supraspinatus tears were retrospectively enrolled in this study and divided in 2 groups: arthroscopic repair (group A, 20 patients) and reinstated (group B, 18 patients). At a mean follow-up of 18 months, both groups underwent clinical (Constant, QuickDash, VAS), dynamometric and ultrasonographic evaluation. RESULTS: In both groups a significant clinical improvement was registered compared to baseline. However, surgical treatment yielded better results in Constant (p=0.004), Quick-Dash (p=0.0012), VAS (p=0.048) and strength evaluation (p=0.0014). In group A the re-tear rate was 10%, while in group B only 11% of increased tear size was registered. CONCLUSION: At a short term follow-up, the surgical treatment of small to medium supraspinatus tears yielded better clinical outcomes compared to the rehabilitation protocol, with better strength outcomes and 10% re-tear rate. Nevertheless, physiotherapy still offers acceptable results and could be a valuable option in patients not undergoing surgery. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - <b>Objective</b> To describe a new presentation of tears and retears of the rotator cuff, which we denominate captured rotator cuff (CRC). We also aim to evaluate it clinically and through images. <b>Methods</b> We assessed retrospectively 16 patients with intraoperative diagnosis of CRC between March 2005 and September 2017; by means of imaging (radiography and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and functional scores (UCLA and Constant & Murley). In images we analyzed the evolution for rotator cuff arthropathy and presence of retears. Functionally, we compared the affected side with the contralateral side and extensive lesions with nonextensive. <b>Results</b> Five (31.25%) patients presented with rotator cuff arthropathy, and 10 (62.5%) with retears. Three (75%) patients with nonextensive lesions had good/excellent UCLA and Constant & Murley scores. In patients with extensive lesions, when the Constant & Murley score was evaluated, 6 (50%) presented good/excellent results, and in the UCLA score, 7 (58.3%). Comparing the affected side (Constant 74.72 points; UCLA 20 points) with the contralateral side (Constant 96.96 points; UCLA 25.63 points), there were worse functional results with statistical significance. <b>Conclusion</b> The diagnosis of CRC is suspected by characteristic findings on MRI and confirmed in arthroscopy. The affected shoulders present worse functional postoperative scores.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of tendon integrity following open cuff repairs with functional and isokinetic strength measurements. Twenty-six shoulders of 25 patients were included in this study. At the final follow-up, 14 repairs (53.8%) were intact and 12 repairs (46.2%) had failed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mean UCLA score at latest follow-up was 28.5 and mean Constant score was 80.3. Constant scores were found to be significantly low for the failed group. Age was found to be significantly related to failed repair. Fatty infiltration stage in the failed repair group was significantly high, and a strong positive correlation for both groups existed pre and postoperatively. When both groups were compared, the failed group was found to have significantly low measurements at extension and internal rotation. Despite high failure rates, functional results were satisfactory. Increased age and fatty infiltration stage decrease success.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in fatty degeneration and atrophy of rotator cuff muscles after arthroscopic repair. We further assessed the factors affecting the functional outcomes and integrity of the rotator cuff. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and two prospectively followed patients who underwent single-row arthroscopic repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tears between 2008 and 2010 in our institution were included. All patients underwent shoulder MRI examination before the arthroscopic repair and at the final follow-up at least 2 years after the surgical repair. Supraspinatus muscle atrophy was measured and evaluated according to the Thomazeau classification. The fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles was graded according to the Goutallier classification. Functional outcomes were assessed with the Constant shoulder score. The changes in fatty degeneration and atrophy were analyzed during the treatment period. Correlation coefficients (Pearson r) and stepwise, multiple linear regression were used to determine the relationship between the outcome variables (final Constant score and integrity of the cuff), and the predictor variables, age, sex, follow-up duration, initial muscle atrophy, final muscle atrophy, initial fatty degeneration and final fatty degeneration. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients reviewed, 87 patients responded and concluded the final clinical follow-up and MRI examination (85.2 % follow-up rate). There were 67 females and 20 males with a mean age of 62.5 +/- 8.3 years (range 40-80 years). Mean follow-up period was 30.1 +/- 5.8 months (range 24-43 months). At the final follow-up, the mean Constant shoulder score was 94.2 +/- 8.2 (range 70-100), and 66 (75.9 %) patients rated as excellent, 14 (16.1 %) as good, and 7 (8.0 %) as fair. No patient had poor results. There was re-rupture in 26 (29.9 %) patients on final MRI examination. No patient had improvement in muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration. The atrophic changes between intact tendon and re-rupture cases were statistically similar (p = 0.300). The deterioration of fatty degeneration was significantly higher in the re-rupture group (p = 0.0001). The Constant shoulder score was significantly lower in patients with re-rupture (97.4 +/- 5.0 versus 86.6 +/- 9.3, p = 0.001). Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the Constant score was dependent on the final integrity of the tendon and the size of the tear (R (2) 0.420, p 0.001). The final integrity of the tendon was dependent on the age of the patient, initial and final fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles and the size of the tear (R (2) 0.669, p 0.001). CONCLUSION: Initial muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration did not improve even after a successful rotator cuff repair where the tendon anatomic integrity was maintained for at least 2 years. It may continue to deteriorate, and the best possibility was preservation of the preoperative status. On the other hand, in cases of re-rupture, fatty degeneration and atrophy continued to worsen significantly. The factors affecting tendon integrity were found to be the age of the patient, the size of the tear and the severity of preoperative fatty degeneration in the rotator cuff.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify any dose-dependent association between the use of subacromial corticosteroid injections within a year before rotator cuff repair (RCR) and subsequent need for revision rotator cuff surgery. METHODS: Two large administrative databases were queried for patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR. A minimum of 1 year of preoperative database exposure and 2 years of postoperative database follow-up were required for inclusion. Patients were stratified into groups that received 0 (control), 1, 2, or 3 or more ipsilateral corticosteroid shoulder injections within the year prior to RCR. The outcome of interest was ipsilateral revision arthroscopic or open RCR or arthroscopic debridement for a diagnosis of rotator cuff tear within 2 years of the index surgery. Revision rates were compared between groups using a multivariate logistic regression analysis controlling for demographic and comorbidity confounders. RESULTS: A total of 110,567 patients from the Medicare database and 12,892 patients from the private insurance database were included. There was no association between a single injection within the year prior to RCR and revision surgery in either cohort. The use of 2 or more injections was associated with a significant increase in the risk of requiring revision surgery in both the Medicare (odds ratio [OR], 2.76-3.26; P < .0001) and private insurance (OR, 2.53-2.87; P < .0001) populations. CONCLUSIONS: A single shoulder injection within a year prior to arthroscopic RCR was not associated with any increased risk of revision surgery; however, the administration of 2 or more injections was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent revision rotator cuff surgery (OR, 2.53-3.26). Although causality cannot be established on the basis of this database review, caution is recommended when considering more than 1 shoulder corticosteroid injection in patients with potentially repairable rotator cuff tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears has been associated with satisfactory improvement in pain and function. The goal of this study was to compare the results of patients with diabetes and patients without diabetes after the 2 cohorts underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 56 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes mellitus and 67 patients without diabetes, all of whom underwent arthroscopic RCR with 1 year of follow-up. Changes in range of motion (ROM), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and Penn Shoulder Score (PSS) were compared between both groups at 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant improvement in ROM for both groups. However, patients without diabetes had greater forward flexion (P = 0.02), abduction (P = 0.04), and external rotation (P = 0.004). Both groups noted significant improvement in their respective ASES score and PSS. However, patients with diabetes had a lower ASES score (P < 0.01) and PSS (P < 0.01). There were no differences in recurrent tears or complications. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic RCR in patients with diabetes resulted in improved postoperative ROM and function.

AB  - Background: Symptomatic rotator cuff tears can cause significant pain and functional disturbance, with associated financial ramifications. Non-surgical management should always be considered initially, however if recalcitrant to these measures surgical intervention may involve open, arthroscopic-assisted mini-open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. The use of trans-osseous sutures and suture anchors has been reported with good results, with no significant differences if the repair remains intact or recurrent tears occur. The role of traditional suture anchors has been assessed clinically and biomechanically, however there have been reports of pull out, anchor material found within joint and concerns with the amount of bone loss. The all suture anchor (ASA) is proposed to address these concerns with encouraging cadaveric, biomechanical results to date. Methods: The two senior authors performed 31 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs using ASA with a double row technique at the two study centres'. The patients were reviewed in clinic at one month, three months, 6 months and a year postoperatively. The patients were assessed with the Constant score and clinical range of motion of the shoulder in abduction, forward flexion, external rotation and internal rotation. The surgical technique and rehabilitation was the same for both surgeons. Results: At a mean follow up of 10.2 months (range 3-12 months) the mean constant score was 77.1 (range 35-90), with a mean abduction of 139.6degree (range 30-180degree), external rotation of 43.4degree (range 20-80degree), and internal rotation to lumbar vertebrae 3-4 (range buttock to lumbar vertebra 1). There has been one re-rupture to date. Conclusions: The functional and clinical results in our study are comparable to those reported in literature using standard anchors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Comparing radiologic bone ingrowth and the clinical outcomes of an open-construct (PEEK) (polyether ether ketone) suture anchor with those of a bio-composite suture anchor (glycolic polylactic acid anchors, beta-tricalcium phosphate and calcium sulphate) in patients with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: From August 2017 to January 2019, 33 patients of both sexes, aged between 44 and 78 years underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for tears considered repairable with an extension not exceeding4 cm. The bioabsorbable anchors used comprised glycolic polylactic acid/beta-tricalcium phosphate/ calcium sulphate, and the non-absorbable anchors in polyetheretherketone (PEEK). All patients underwent MRI evaluation at 12 months postoperatively to determine complications and identify any re-tear. RESULTS: Clinical scores showed an improvement from both clinical and functional point of view. There were no statistically significant changes compared to the physical examination. On radiographs, mobilizations, anchor pull-outs or other complications did not occur in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder function improved after complete repair of the rotator cuff and similar clinical results were achieved regardless of the material and shape of the suture anchor. The bioabsorbable anchors in innovative open architecture material seem to have results comparable to peek anchors. Unfortunately, further studies are needed to define the advantages in using one material compared to the other. (www.actabiomedica.it).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Repair of cuff tears involving rotator interval reportedly improves function. However, it is unclear whether successful repair prevents shoulder degenerative changes. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Therefore, we (1) documented the minimal 4-year function of patients who underwent open surgical repair for rotator interval tears; (2) evaluated repaired tendon healing with postoperative MRI; and (3) sought to determine the influence of tendon healing on muscular and glenohumeral joint changes. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 22 patients (23 shoulders) treated by open transosseous reinsertion of supraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. The mean age of the patients was 53 years (range, 37-64 years). The tear was traumatic in four cases. Repair healing and muscular changes were assessed using MRI. The minimum followup was 46 months (mean, 75 months; range, 46-103 months). RESULTS: We observed an improvement in the absolute Constant-Murley score from 63 points preoperatively to 76 points postoperatively. With the last followup MRI, the supraspinatus tendon repair had failed in two of the 23 shoulders, whereas the subscapularis tendon repair had healed in all cases. Once healing of the repaired tendon occurred, supraspinatus muscle atrophy never worsened. However, on MRI fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles increased despite successful tendon repair. Glenohumeral arthritis remained stable. Postoperative abduction and internal rotation strengths were better when the standardized supraspinatus muscle area was greater than 0.5 at the final evaluation. CONCLUSION: Durable functional improvement and limited degenerative articular and muscular changes can be expected in most patients 4 to 10 years after open repair of anterosuperior cuff tears provided that healing of the cuff is obtained. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of rotator cuff tears increases with age, and many patients undergo surgical repair. Retears are not uncommon, with rates ranging between 9% and 36% in recent studies, and are a major concern. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between patient age and the chance of healing following rotator cuff repair. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair performed by a single surgeon. All patients had an ultrasound performed by a musculoskeletal sonographer 6 months after rotator cuff repair to assess the repair integrity. RESULTS: The cohort of 1,600 patients was normally distributed in terms of age, with a mean age (and standard error of the mean) of 59 +/- 0.3 years and a range of 15 to 91 years. The 212 patients (13%) who had a retear at 6 months were also normally distributed in terms of age, with a mean age of 65 +/- 0.8 years and a range of 15 to 88 years. The retear rate in patients <50 years old was 5%. This increased to 10% in patients aged 50 to 59 years, 15% in those aged 60 to 69 years, 25% in those aged 70 to 79 years, and 34% in those aged >=80 years. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that patient age was an independent factor strongly associated with retears. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of rotator cuff retears is low in patients <50 years of age. The relationship between age and rotator cuff retears is linear in patients 50 to 69 years of age, with an increase of 5% between decades, and increases substantially in patients >=70 years old. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the repair integrity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and secondarily, clinical outcomes, of medium to large (2-4 cm) rotator cuff tears treated using an arthroscopic triple-loaded medially based single-row repair technique augmented laterally with bone marrow vents. METHODS: This is a retrospective outcomes study of patients with full-thickness medium to large (2-4 cm) rotator cuff tears repaired by 4 surgeons at a single institution over a 2-year period with a minimum of 24 months' follow-up. A single-row repair with tension-minimizing medially based triple-loaded anchors and laterally placed bone marrow vents was used. Patients completed a satisfaction and pain survey, the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff index questionnaire, and a Short Form-36 version 2 survey to evaluate clinical outcomes. MRI was obtained at a minimum of 24 months follow-up to assess repair integrity. RESULTS: A total of 64 males and 27 females with a mean age of 59.7 (range, 34-82) were included. The mean tear size was 2.6 cm in anteroposterior dimension, treated with a mean of 2.2 anchors. Eighty-three of 91 shoulders (91%) reported being completely satisfied with their result. The median Western Ontario Rotator Cuff score was 95.2% of normal, with a significant difference found between those with an intact repair and those with a full-thickness recurrent defect (median, 95.9% vs. 73.8%; P = .003). Postoperative MRI obtained at a median of 32 months (range, 24-48) demonstrated an intact repair in 84 of 91 shoulders (92%), with failure defined as a full-thickness defect of the tendon. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of medium to large rotator cuff tears using triple-loaded medially based single-row repair augmented with marrow vents resulted in a 92% healing rate by MRI and excellent patient-reported outcomes LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, retrospective case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff repairs in patients aged older than 65 years are reported to have a high failure rate. Furthermore, asymptomatic cuff tearing is frequent in this age group, so the value of tendon repair has been questioned. Our aim was to review the results of cuff repair in these patients and to identify factors predicting outcome. METHODS: In this study, 58 patients aged older than 65 years with reparable supraspinatus tears underwent primary open (22 patients) or arthroscopic (36 patients) repair. The leading symptom was pain despite nonoperative treatment for at least 6 months. Tendon healing was assessed on ultrasonography. RESULTS: Forty-four shoulders could be reviewed at a mean follow-up of 57 months (range, 24-112 months). Tendon healing was complete in 31 shoulders (70%). The mean Constant score (CS) improved from 49 points (range, 5-74 points) preoperatively to 78 points (range, 23-100 points) at follow-up (P < .05). The respective values for the relative CS were 64% (range, 7%-97%) and 95% (range, 33%-100%) (P < .05). The mean CS was better for healed repairs (82 points [range, 57-100 points]) than for nonhealed repairs (61 points [range, 23-88 points]) (P < .05). In 41 of 44 cases (93%), patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the operation. Though not statistically significant, dominance, cortisone injection, smoking, and tendon retraction appeared to favor nonhealing. CONCLUSIONS: Isolated supraspinatus tendon repairs in patients aged older than 65 years have a high healing potential and yield good clinical results with even better outcome if the repairs heal. Repair of symptomatic single-tendon rotator cuff tears in patients aged older than 65 years who do not respond to conservative treatment appears justified.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of suture techniques on clinical outcomes and re-tear rate following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (aRCR) in full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Material(s) and Method(s): The study included 115 consecutive aRCRs with a minimum 1-year follow-up. Patients were divided into two groups according to the repair technique used (Group 1: single-row technique; Group 2: double-row technique). Pre-and postoperative clinical and functional outcomes were measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), the Constant-Murley Score (CMS) and range of motion (ROM) (abduction degrees). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was used for radiological evaluation pre-and postoperatively. Patte' classification was used to determine the retraction amount of the tear. Failure was determined by MRI imaging together with clinical and functional evaluation. A comparative analysis of clinical and functional outcomes and failure rates were performed between groups. Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 25.3 +/- 9.7 months. The mean age at the time of surgery was 58.6 +/- 8.3 years. While no statistical difference was observed between preoperative patient and tear characteristics, the number of anchors used in Group 2 was significantly higher than the Group 1, p=0.001). A significant improvement was found in clinical and functional scores in both groups (p < 0.001 for both). However, pre-and postoperative clinical and functional outcomes and failure rates did not differ between groups (p>0.05). Eight patients (7%) had a re-tear at the last follow-up (4 in Group 1; 4 in Group 2, p=0.571). Patients with no re-tear could return to their preoperative activities at the last follow-up. Discussion(s): Satisfactory results can be obtained in the early postoperative period, regardless of the suture technique in aRCR of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. We suggest that the single-row method is at least as effective as the double-row and cost-effective procedure in aRCR. Copyright © 2021, Derman Medical Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - We conducted a study to determine whether intractable postoperative stiffness or deltoid damage results from primary arthroscopic anterior acromioplasty and mini-open repair of full-thickness tears of the superior rotator cuff. Eighty-three repairs (80 patients) were available for follow-up at a mean (range) of 57.2 (12-98) months. Range of motion at presentation and motion in contralateral shoulder at final follow-up were used for comparison. Significant improvements were seen in active forward elevation, passive forward elevation, and active external rotation at 90degree abduction. Final motion in the operative and contralateral shoulders was similar. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder index improved significantly (P<.0001) from 50.0 before surgery to 88.3 after surgery. Although 1 patient had a symptomatic retear that required revision surgery, there were no cases of intractable stiffness, and there were no cases of deltoid damage.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes of knotless suture bridge repair after a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. METHODS: A prospective consecutive series of full-thickness supraspinatus atraumatic chronic tears was evaluated in the study. Tears were medium or large. Further inclusion criteria were minimum clinical follow-up of 5 years with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24 months and fatty infiltration <2. Patients with shoulder stiffness, arthritis, or rotator cuff tear involving the subscapularis tendon were excluded. An arthroscopic cuff repair was performed using a knotless double-row suture bridge technique with braided suture tapes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Constant score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, strength score, and a visual analog scale. Tendon healing was analyzed according to Sugaya MRI classification at 24 months. A Sugaya score of 1 or 2 was considered as tendon healing. Statistical analysis was performed with the Student's t-test. P = .05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included in this series. Mean follow-up was equal to 68.8 +/- 7 months. At last follow-up, the mean visual analog scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, and Constant scores improved significantly from 5.5 +/- 1.6, 48.2 +/- 13.1, 37.8 +/- 8.3, to 2.1 +/- 2.1 (P = 5.43 E-14), 87.4 +/- 15.8 (P = 7.15 E-27), and 82.8 +/- 14.7 (P = 1.01 E-33), respectively. Anteflexion improved from 99.3degree +/- 13.4degree preoperatively to 136.6degree +/- 15.9degree at last follow-up (P = 3.08 E-21). Strength score was significantly higher postoperatively (18.4 +/- 6.7 vs 8.3 +/- 3.5). MRI showed 88% (n = 57) of Sugaya 1-2 repairs. Patients with unhealed rotator cuffs showed significantly lower functional results than the Sugaya 1-2 group. No correlation between degree of retraction and rate of healing was observed. Four symptomatic patients (6%) required revision for failed rotator cuff repair. CONCLUSIONS: Despite potential confounding factors, arthroscopic knotless suture bridge repair of rotator cuff tears with acromioplasty demonstrated excellent long-term results of tendon healing, pain relief, and improvement of shoulder function. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the effect of time to repair on the outcome after an acute rotator cuff tear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on patients presenting with acute rotator cuff tear to our shoulder clinic. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the Oxford Shoulder Score, and symptomatic retears were diagnosed by clinical assessment plus imaging. RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent rotator cuff repair within 6 months of injury via initial referral through the Acute Shoulder Injury Clinic (early repair group; mean age, 60 years; age range, 39-77 years). Twenty age- and sex-matched patients were identified who had undergone delayed repair (6-18 months after injury; mean age, 60 years; age range, 40-78 years). The mean follow-up period was 10 months for the early repair group versus 11 months for the delayed repair group. Both groups had clinically significant improvements in their Oxford scores, although the early repair group had an improvement that was nearly double that of the delayed repair group (20.3 for early vs 10.4 for delayed, P = .0014). Postoperative Oxford scores were significantly higher in the early repair group (mean of 43.8 for early vs 35.8 for delayed, P = .0057). There were 2 symptomatic retears in the early repair group versus 5 in the delayed repair group. CONCLUSION: Our results show improved outcomes with early repair (within 6 months) of acute rotator cuff tears and support the provision of an acute shoulder injury referral clinic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retear or nonhealing of a surgically repaired rotator cuff is common, but the determinants of retear are poorly understood. We aimed to determine the relationship between preoperative and intraoperative factors and retear rate following rotator cuff repair and to formulate a predictive model based on this relationship, including any interaction effects between tear size, patient age, and surgical experience in contributing to the retear rate. METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of prospectively collected data from 1962 consecutive patients who underwent a primary arthroscopic single-row rotator cuff repair performed by the senior author from 2007 through 2018 and postoperatively returned for 6-month follow-up ultrasonography. RESULTS: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed anteroposterior tear length to be the most important independent predictor of retear (Wald statistic, 90; P < .001). Other independent predictors included case number (Wald statistic, 59; P < .001), patient age at surgery (Wald statistic, 30; P < .001), and type of hospital (public vs. private) (Wald statistic, 17; P < .001). The data indicated that following rotator cuff repair, there was a 4-fold increase in the retear rate as the anteroposterior tear size increased from 1 cm to 3 cm; a 8-fold decrease when comparing case number 1000 with case number 3000; a 2-fold increase as patient age increased from 50 years to 70 years; and a 3-fold increase when comparing surgery performed in a public hospital vs. a private hospital. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.84), indicating that our equation could predict 81% of retears. CONCLUSIONS: Anteroposterior tear length was the most important independent predictor of retear or nonhealing. Other predictive factors included case number, patient age at surgery, and hospital type. The predictive effect of anteroposterior tear length, patient age, and case number in contributing to retear was additive. Our regression equation may be used to calculate patient rotator cuff retear risk at 6 months after repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Impaired healing after rotator cuff repair is a major concern, with retear rates as high as 94%. A method to predict whether patients are likely to experience poor surgical outcomes would change clinical practice. While various patient factors, such as age and tear size, have been linked to poor functional outcomes, it is currently very challenging to predict outcomes before surgery. PURPOSE: To evaluate gene expression differences in tissue collected during surgery between patients who ultimately went on to have good outcomes and those who experienced a retear, in an effort to determine if surgical outcomes can be predicted. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Rotator cuff tissue was collected at the time of surgery from 140 patients. Patients were tracked for a minimum of 6 months to identify those with good or poor outcomes, using clinical functional scores and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging to confirm failure to heal or retear. Gene expression differences between 8 patients with poor outcomes and 28 patients with good outcomes were assessed using a multiplex gene expression analysis via NanoString and a custom-curated panel of 145 genes related to various stages of rotator cuff healing. RESULTS: Although significant differences in the expression of individual genes were not observed, gene set enrichment analysis highlighted major differences in gene sets. Patients who had poor healing outcomes showed greater expression of gene sets related to extracellular matrix production (P < .0001) and cellular biosynthetic pathways (P < .001), while patients who had good healing outcomes showed greater expression of genes associated with the proinflammatory (M1) macrophage phenotype (P < .05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that a more proinflammatory, fibrotic environment before repair may play a role in poor healing outcome. With validation in a larger cohort, these results may ultimately lead to diagnostic methods to preoperatively predict those at risk for poor surgical outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: Assessment of repair integrity and clinical outcome after arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears in double-row suture-bridge technique with the use of a new knotless suture-anchor system. METHODS: The first treated 25 patients with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in the suture-bridge technique using a novel knotless anchor and chain-link suture system were evaluated. Patients with isolated full-thickness supraspinatus tears were selected. They were followed clinically with functional scores (Constant score, ASES index), visual analog scale (VAS), and instrumentally with Isobex digital strength analyzer preoperatively, at 6 and 14 months postoperatively. The repair integrity was evaluated with MRI at an average of 14 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Significant improvement of pain, strength, range of motion, and functional scores occurred (P < 0.05). There was a re-tear rate of 20%. The subjective parameters (VAS and ASES Index) showed non-significant (n.s.) differences between the re-tear and intact repair groups, whereas the objective parameters (Constant score, muscle power and active ROM) showed significant differences between both groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The functional outcome has improved significantly with this new knotless anchor-chain system and was more superior in shoulders with intact repair, whereas the resulted repair integrity was not better than other types of double-row repair techniques mentioned in the recent literature. However, this early report of the novel technique may show limited power for comparison due to the relatively small sample size.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term clinical and anatomic results after open rotator cuff repair. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Fifty-three patients were included in this study. Rotator cuff tears were limited to one tendon in 34, and two tendons or more in 19. The supraspinatus tendon was involved alone in 30 cases, and the subscapularis in four. Clinical, radiographic and MRI evaluations were performed for all patients at ten-year minimum follow-up. RESULTS: At 11.4-years average follow-up, satisfactory results were obtained with improvement on pain level, in range of motion with a gain in active anterior elevation and in external rotation as well as in strength in abduction. Absolute Constant score reached 74.7 points and adjusted Constant score 99.6%. SSV was 82.5% with a SST score of 10 points. Osteoarthritis changes increased with follow-up with osteoarthritis lesion in 69% of the cases. MRI evaluation found a re-tear of the repair in 42% of the cases: 30% when only the supraspinatus tendon was initially involved, and 63% when two or more tendons were repaired. Tear size and quality of the repair were the most important prognosis factors for re-tear of the repair. No correlation was found between the occurrence of a new tear and the clinical outcome. CONLCUSION: Surgical repair of chronic rotator cuff tendon tear can produce consistent and lasting pain relief and improvement in range of motion. Re-tear of the repair was not correlated with degradation of clinical results. Best results were obtained for isolated supraspinatus tear with a complete surgical repair.

AB  - Background: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is a common but technically difficult surgical technique. This study describes a novel arthroscopic rotator cuff repair technique where the repair was performed while visualized entirely from the glenohumeral joint. A single-row knotless tension band inverted mattress suture technique was utilized with fixation obtained via suture anchors. The technique was relatively easy to perform and demonstrated good repair strength and footprint compression in an ex vivo ovine model. Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of this technique in 1000 consecutive patients. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in 1000 consecutive patients. Included patients underwent primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a single surgeon performing the undersurface repair technique and attended 6-month follow-up with ultrasound evaluation to determine repair integrity. Exclusion criteria were irreparable tears, incomplete repairs, tendon reconstruction with a synthetic patch, and revision cases. Results: The only complication was retear. The overall retear rate at 6 months following repair with the undersurface technique was 8.5%. The mean +/- SEM operative time for the technique was 16 +/- 0.3 minutes (range, 4-75 minutes). There were no infections. Smaller tears were repaired faster and had better healing rates. Conclusion: The novel all-inside arthroscopic rotator cuff repair technique was safe and significantly faster and provided better healing rates than other repair techniques. The retear rate of 8.5% is, to the authors' knowledge, the lowest reported rotator cuff retear rate in a large cohort of patients based on a single technique.

AB  - Background: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair can be quite complex and time consuming, particularly early in the surgeon's learning curve. Hypothesis: Patients who have undergone rotator cuff repair with shorter operative times will be less likely to have a rotator cuff retear at 6 months postoperatively. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study was an analysis of data from 1600 consecutive patients (670 partial-thickness and 930 full-thickness tears) who had rotator cuff repair performed by a single surgeon utilizing an arthroscopic, single-row, knotless inverted mattress suture anchor technique. All patients underwent ultrasound at 6 months postoperatively to determine repair integrity. Moving average analysis was performed for the variables of operative time and case number to evaluate the surgeon's learning curve. Results: For early cases, the mean operative time was approximately 35 minutes. After approximately 450 cases, the operative time plateaued at approximately 20 minutes. The mean operative time for the cohort (+/-SEM) was 22 +/- 0.3 minutes, and the mean retear rate was 13%. Increased operative time was associated with a retear (r = 0.18; P < .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the variables with the most independent effect on retears were larger tear size (Wald statistic = 36; P < .001), lower case number (ie, less surgeon experience) (Wald statistic = 28; P < .001), older patient age (Wald statistic = 23; P < .001), full-thickness tears (Wald statistic = 13; P < .001), and lower surgeon-rated repair quality (Wald statistic = 8; P = .004). Operative time was not a significant independent factor contributing to retears. Conclusion: Operative time and rotator cuff retear rates decreased as surgical team experience increased. The hypothesis of this study, however, was not supported. The reduced retear rate was not related to a reduction in operative time per se but rather to improved surgical team experience and patient factors, such as improved healing with smaller tears in younger patients.

AB  - Background: There are few studies reporting long-term rotator cuff integrity following repair. The present study reports a case series of surgically repaired supraspinatus tendons followed up with clinical outcomes and ultrasound imaging after an average of 16 years. Methods: The prospectively studied clinical outcomes at short-, medium- and long-term follow-up in 27 shoulders in 25 patients treated with arthroscopic subacromial decompression and mini-open rotator cuff repair have been reported previously. The functional outcomes scores recorded were the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) measures. These patients then underwent an ultrasound scan with respect to the long-term assessment of the shoulder and the integrity of the repair. Results: A recurrent tear was noted in 37% of patients at 16.25 years after surgery, of which 50% were small. Two patients required repeat surgery. Patients had a mean UCLA score of 30, an ASES score of 91.3 and a SST score of 9.5 with a 85% level of satisfaction with surgery. Patients with a recurrent tear had outcome scores equivalent to those with an intact cuff with no significant pain. No independent risk factors were identified as predictors for recurrent tear. Conclusions: Patients showed sustained benefit and satisfaction at long-term follow-up despite a 37% recurrence of full-thickness supraspinatus tear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventing anatomic failure after rotator cuff repair (RCR) remains a challenge. Augmentation with a surgical mesh may permanently reinforce the repair and decrease failure rates. The purpose of this study is to assess the postoperative outcomes of open RCR augmented with a novel reticulated polycarbonate polyurethane patch. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients with supraspinatus tendon tears underwent open RCR augmented with a polycarbonate polyurethane patch secured in a 6-point fixation construct placed over the repaired tendon. Patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative outcome measures, including the Simple Shoulder Test, visual analog pain scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder score, Cumulative Activities of Daily Living score, and University of California, Los Angeles shoulder scale, as well as range of motion. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate repair status. RESULTS: Patients showed significant improvements in visual analog pain scale, Simple Shoulder Test, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder scores at both 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). The University of California, Los Angeles postoperative score was good to excellent in 7 patients at 6 months and in 8 patients at 12 months. Range of motion in forward flexion, abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation was significantly improved at both 6 and 12 months postoperatively (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months showed healing in 90%; one patient had a definitive persistent tear. We found no adverse events associated with the patch, including the absence of fibrosis, mechanical symptoms, or visible subacromial adhesions. DISCUSSION: The polycarbonate polyurethane patch was designed to support tissue in growth and enhance healing as shown by preclinical animal studies. Clinically, the patch is well tolerated and shows promising efficacy, with a 10% retear rate at the 12-month time point.

AB  - Background: Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using a linked double-row equivalent construct results in significantly higher load to failure compared with conventional transosseous-equivalent constructs. Purpose: To determine the patient-reported outcomes (PROs), reoperation rates, and complication rates after linked double-row equivalent rotator cuff repair for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent linked double-row equivalent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with minimum 2-year follow-up were included. The primary outcome was the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score at final follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire, visual analog scale (VAS), reoperations, and complications. Clinical relevance was defined by the minimally clinically important difference (MCID). Comparisons on an individual level that exceeded MCID (individual-level scores) were deemed clinically relevant. Comparisons between preoperative and postoperative scores were completed using the Student t test. All P values were reported with significance set at P < .05. Results: A total of 42 shoulders in 41 consecutive patients were included in this study (21 male patients [51.2%]; mean age, 64.5 +/- 11.9 years; mean follow-up, 29.7 +/- 4.5 months). All patients (100%) completed the minimum 2-year follow-up. The rotator cuff tear measured on average 15.2 +/- 8.9 mm in the coronal plane and 14.6 +/- 9.8 mm in the sagittal plane. The ASES score improved significantly from 35.5 +/- 18.2 preoperatively to 93.4 +/- 10.6 postoperatively (P < .001). The QuickDASH (P < .001), SST (P < .001), and VAS (P < .001) scores also significantly improved after surgery. All patients (42/42 shoulders; 100%) achieved clinically relevant improvement (met or exceeded MCID) on ASES and SST scores postoperatively. There were no postoperative complications (0.0%) or reoperations (0.0%) at final follow-up. Conclusion: Arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears with the linked double-row equivalent construct results in statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in PRO scores with low complication rates (0.0%) and reoperation rates (0.0%) at short-term follow-up.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if reoperation rates are higher for patients who underwent isolated rotator cuff repair (RCR) than those who underwent RCR with concomitant biceps tenodesis using a large private-payer database. METHODS: A national insurance database was queried for patients who underwent arthroscopic RCR between the years 2007 and 2014 (PearlDiver, Warsaw, IN). The Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) 29,827 (arthroscopy, shoulder, surgical; with RCR) identified RCR patients who were subdivided into 3 groups-group 1: RCR without biceps tenodesis; group 2: RCR with concomitant arthroscopic biceps tenodesis (CPT 29827 and 29,828); group 3: RCR with concomitant open biceps tenodesis (CPT 29827 and 23,430). Reoperation rates (revision RCR, subsequent biceps surgeries) and complications at 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare reoperations and complications between groups. Rotator cuff tear size, whether the biceps was ruptured and whether a biceps tenotomy was performed, was not available. RESULTS: Group 1: 27,178 patients. Group 2: 4,810 patients. Group 3: 1,493 patients. More patients underwent concomitant arthroscopic than concomitant open tenodesis (P < .001). A total of 2,509 patients underwent a reoperation for RCR or biceps tenodesis within 1 year after RCR. When adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities, no significant differences in reoperation rates at 30 days or 90 days among the 3 groups, but significantly more patients who had a tenodesis, required a reoperation compared with those who did not have a tenodesis at 6 months and 1 year (both P < .001). Urinary tract infections were more common in patients who did not have a tenodesis, whereas dislocation, nerve injury, and surgical site infection were more common in tenodesis patients. CONCLUSIONS: Higher reoperation rates at 1 year were seen in patients who had concomitant biceps tenodesis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control database review study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tears are closely related with muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration and both affect healing after surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to compare surgical versus conservative management of medium-to-large reparable rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Forty-one patients with clinical and radiological (MRI) diagnosis of medium-to-large rotator cuff tears were retrospectively identified and divided into two groups: Group A, arthroscopic repair; Group B, conservative treatment. At follow-up (T1) all patients underwent a new clinical (VAS, SST, Constant and Relative Constant Scale) and radiological evaluation (MRI). RESULTS: When comparing the two groups at T1 (mean follow-up: Group A, 50 months; Group B, 61 months), we registered better results in Group A in the SST (p < 0.05), the VAS score (p < 0.01), the Constant and the Relative Constant Scale (p < 0.05). Radiological evaluation did not show a significant increase of fatty infiltration (p = 0.16) in Group A (no progression in 15 out of 17 patients -82.3%-, and an increase in 2 out of 17 patients -11.7%-), while in Group B a significant increase was detected (p < 0.01) in all patients; in regard to muscle atrophy, no cases of progression were detected in Group A (4 out of 17 patients -23.5%- showed an increased post-operative supraspinatus trophysm), while a significant worsening (p < 0.05) was found in Group B. In Group B a significant worsening of tendon retraction (p < 0.01) and of tear size (p = 0.01) was also detected. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of complete rotator cuff tears seems to decrease the irreversible changes that involve muscle belly.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate whether subscapularis muscle atrophy is a negative prognostic factor leading to increased risk of retears in patients treated with an arthroscopic subscapularis tendon repair. We hypothesized that fatty infiltration of the subscapularis muscle deteriorates the clinical and sonographic outcome of the arthroscopic repair and inhibits reparability of the ruptured tendons. A double- center, multinational, retrospective, blind (in the follow-up) clinical study regarding 32 patients who underwent an arthroscopic subscapularis repair was conducted. Patients were divided into two groups according to the preoparative fatty infiltration grade of subscapularis muscle (group A: grade<II, group B: grade II or higher). Reparability was not influenced by the grade of preoperative fatty infiltration of subscapularis muscle. The preoperative MRI scans showed significantly higher grades of fatty infiltration (group B) in the subscapularis muscle of patients with clinical evidence of retear after the arthroscopic repair. Low grades of preoperative subscapularis muscle atrophy are significantly correlated with low clinical and sonographic retear's rate after subscapularis arthroscopic repair, while high grades were a clear negative prognostic factor for the clinical outcome of the aforementioned patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown preoperative opioid use to influence outcomes after various surgical procedures. Researchers have not assessed this relationship after rotator cuff repair (RCR). HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: The purpose was to assess the relationship between preoperative opioid use and outcomes after arthroscopic RCR. We hypothesized that patients prescribed higher daily averages of preoperative oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) would show increased rates of 90-day complications and 3-year revision surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The MarketScan claims database was utilized to identify patients who underwent arthroscopic RCR between 2009 and 2018. We used preoperative opioid use status to divide patients into groups based on the average daily OMEs consumed in the 6 months before surgery: opioid-naive, <1, 1-<5, 5-<10, and >=10 OMEs per day. We retrieved 90-day complication and 3-year revision surgery rates. Opioid use groups were then compared with binomial logistic regression and generalized linear models. RESULTS: We identified 214,283 patients. Of those patients, 50.7% did not receive any preoperative opioids, while 7.7%, 26.8%, 6.3%, and 8.6% received <1, 1-<5, 5-<10, and >=10 OMEs per day over a 6-month time period, respectively. Complications increased with increasing preoperative OMEs. Multivariate analysis revealed that any patient using >=1 OME per day had increased rates of 3-year revision surgery, reoperations, and infections. Specifically, patients averaging >=10 OMEs per day showed a 103% (odds ratio, 2.03 [95% CI, 1.62-2.54]; P < .001) increase in the odds of revision surgery compared with opioid-naive patients. Rates of hospital admissions and postoperative emergency department encounters were higher in all opioid use groups. Adjusted differences in 6-month preoperative and 3-month postoperative health care costs were seen in the opioid use groups compared with opioid-naive patients, ranging from US$1307 to US$5820 (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative opioid use was a risk factor for complications and revision surgery after arthroscopic RCR. We also observed a dose-dependent response between opioid use and postoperative complications.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report complications after arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs (ARCRs) in a large patient cohort based on clinical application of a newly defined core event set (CES) and severity grading. METHODS: Consecutive primary ARCRs documented in a local clinical registry between February 2010 and September 2016 were included. Clinicians documented adverse events (AEs) reported until the final, 6-month postoperative follow-up according to the CES. The CES is an organized list of relevant AEs sorted into 3 intraoperative event groups (device, osteochondral, and soft tissue) and 9 postoperative event groups (device, osteochondral, pain, rotator cuff, surgical-site infection, peripheral neurologic, vascular, superficial soft tissue, and deep soft tissue). Severity was determined using an adaptation of the Clavien-Dindo classification. Cumulative complication risks were calculated per event group and stratified by severity and rotator cuff tear extent. RESULTS: A total of 1,661 repairs were documented in 1,594 patients (mean age, 57 years [standard deviation, 9 years]; 38% women); 21% involved partial tears. All events were recorded according to the CES. Intraoperative events occurred in 2.2% of repairs. We identified 329 postoperative events in 307 repairs (305 patients); 93% had 1 AE. The cumulative AE risk at 6 months was 18.5%; AE risks were 21.8% for partial tears, 15.8% for full-thickness single-tendon tears, 18.0% for tears with 2 ruptured tendons, and 25.6% for tears with 3 ruptured tendons. AE risks per event group were as follows: 9.4% for deep soft tissue, with shoulder stiffness (7.6%) being the most common event; 3.4% for persistent or worsening pain; 3.1% for rotator cuff defects; 1.7% for neurologic lesions; 0.8% for surgical-site infection; 0.7% for device; 0.4% for osteochondral; 0.2% for superficial soft tissue, and 0.1% for vascular. Most AEs had severity grades I (160 [49%]) and II (117 [36%]). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive local AE documentation according to the CES and severity grading was possible and showed that about one-fifth of ARCRs were affected, mostly by one AE of low severity. Shoulder stiffness was the most frequent event. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, case series.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and radiological results of the arthroscopic transosseous (ATO) and transosseous-equivalent (TOE) double-row rotator cuff repair techniques. METHODS: Prospective data collected from patients treated with ATO (32 women and 7 men, mean age: 57.03+/-6.39 years) and TOE (36 women and 8 men; mean age: 57.86+/-7.81 years) techniques were retrospectively evaluated. The visual analog scale score, Constant score, and Oxford shoulder score were used to assess the clinical results. Anchor pullout on standard anteroposterior shoulder radiographs and rotator cuff re-tear on magnetic resonance images were examined at the final follow-up to evaluate the radiological results. Rotator cuff re-tears were graded as per the classification system described by Sugaya et al. CONCLUSION: In the treatment of rotator cuff tears, the ATO and TOE techniques may achieve considerable improvements in shoulder functions in the short term. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Therapeutic study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The level of activity of patients older than 70 years is tending to increase, as are their expectations in terms of joint function recuperation. It has not been proven that rotator cuff repair healing is satisfactory in the elderly. The main hypothesis of this study was: repair of supraspinous lesions in patients older than 70 years is reliable in terms of both clinical results and healing. The secondary hypothesis was: tendon healing is significantly correlated with the Constant, ASES, and SST scores as well as with age, tendon retraction, and fatty infiltration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multicenter prospective study on 145 patients older than 70 years, with 135 patients reviewed at 1 year (93%). The mean age was 73.9 years. Full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus extended at most to the upper third of the infraspinatus and retraction limited to Patte stages 1 and 2 were included. Clinical assessment was carried out in accordance with the Constant, ASES, and SST scores. Healing was evaluated with ultrasound. RESULTS: A significant improvement was noted in the Constant (44/76)+31.5 (P<0.0001), ASES (35/90)+54.4 (P<0.0001), and SST (3.5/10)+6.6 (P>0.0001) scores at 1 year of follow-up. The healing rate was 89% with 15 re-tears, nine of which were stage 1 and six stage 2. The clinical result was not correlated with patient age (Constant, P=0.24; ASES, P=0.38; SST, P=0.83) nor with the retraction stage (Constant, P=0.71; ASES, P=0.35; SST, P=0.69) or the stage of fatty infiltration (P>0.7). Healing was correlated with the quality of the clinical result (Constant, P=0.02; ASES, P=0.03) and age (P=0.01) but was not correlated with retraction or the fatty infiltration stage (P>0.3). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair significantly improves the clinical results, even in patients older than 70 years. The clinical results are not correlated with age (but deterioration of the result was not noted after 75 years) or frontal retraction (but the study only included retractions limited to stages 1 and 2). The healing rate is satisfactory, but this study is limited to small ruptures of the supraspinatus, and the postoperative ultrasound analysis probably inferior to CT imaging with contrast agent injection, often used as the reference. Healing proves to be correlated with the quality of the clinical result and patient age.

AB  - Background Joint surgery is often complicated by gradual bone and cartilage deterioration that eventually leads to secondary osteoarthritis. The primary objective of this study was to identify preoperative risk factors for gleno-humeral osteoarthritis after rotator cuff repair. The secondary objectives were to assess whether the risk of gleno-humeral osteoarthritis was influenced by the operative technique, occurrence of postoperative complications, cuff healing, and muscle degeneration and to determine whether gleno-humeral osteoarthritis affected the clinical outcome. Hypothesis The development of gleno-humeral osteoarthritis affects the postoperative clinical outcome. Material and method A retrospective multicentre study of patients who underwent rotator cuff repair in 2003 and were re-evaluated at least 10 years later was conducted under the aegis of the Societe francaise de chirurgie orthopedique et traumatique (SOFCOT). Osteoarthritis severity was graded according to the Samilson-Prieto classification. Results Four hundred and one patients were included. At last follow-up, at least 10 years after surgery, the radiological Samilson-Prieto grades were distributed as follows: 0, n = 181 (45%); 1, n = 142 (n = 35%); 2, n = 57 (14%); 3, n = 14 (4%); and 4, n = 7 (2%). The mean Constant score was significantly higher in the patients without than with osteoarthritis at last follow-up (79/100 vs. 73/100, P < 0.001). MRI assessment of cuff healing showed that the proportion of patients with osteoarthritis was significantly higher in the group with unhealed or re-torn cuffs (Sugaya type 4 or 5) than in the group with healed cuffs (Sugaya type 1, 2, or 3) (46% vs. 25%, P = 0.012). Discussion Our study showed no associations linking the risk of gleno-humeral osteoarthritis to the patient activity profile, history of shoulder injury, or preoperative symptom duration. In contrast, statistically significant associations were identified between gleno-humeral osteoarthritis and age, male gender, initial tear severity, and the pain and mobility components of the preoperative Constant score. Decreased invasiveness of the operative technique probably diminishes the long-term risk of osteoarthritis. An unhealed or re-torn cuff increases the risk of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is associated with poorer final clinical outcomes. Level of evidence IV, retrospective non-randomised study. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injections are a common treatment for rotator cuff tears. Because of concerns of infection, a surgical procedure is often delayed following injections. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if there is a temporal relationship between corticosteroid injections and the risk of surgical site infection after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. We hypothesized that the incidence of surgical site infection is higher in patients who received a preoperative injection and this relationship exists in a temporal manner as those patients receiving an injection closer to the operative date have a higher risk of infection. METHODS: The PearlDiver database was reviewed for patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair from 2007 to 2016. Patients were stratified into 2 cohorts: those undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair within 1 year of injection (n = 12,060), and those undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair without prior injection (n = 48,763). Patients with preoperative injections were further stratified by the duration in months that the injection was performed prior to the surgical procedure. Surgical site infection within 6 months of the surgical procedure was recorded. Statistical analysis included chi-square and multivariate binomial logistic regression analyses to identify risk factors for surgical site infection. Results were considered significant at p < 0.05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the incidence of surgical site infection in patients receiving a shoulder injection at 0.7% compared with the control cohort at 0.8% (odds ratio [OR], 0.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7 to 1.1]; p = 0.2). However, patients receiving an injection within 1 month prior to operative management had a significantly higher rate of surgical site infection overall at 1.3% compared with the control group at 0.8% (OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0 to 2.9]; p = 0.04). On multivariate analysis, male sex (OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9]; p = 0.001), obesity (OR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6]; p < 0.001), diabetes (OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5]; p < 0.001), smoking status (OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.4 to 1.9], p < 0.001), and preoperative corticosteroid injections within 1 month of the surgical procedure (OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5 to 2.7]; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for development of a surgical site infection. CONCLUSIONS: Injections within 1 month of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair significantly increases the risk of surgical site infection. However, there is no increased risk of infection if the surgical procedure is delayed by 1 month following an injection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) is one of the most commonly performed orthopaedic surgical procedures; however, patient-reported outcomes have varied greatly in the literature. PURPOSE: To identify preoperative factors that affect outcomes and to develop prognostic tools for predicting functional outcomes in future ARCR cases. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Patients were included who underwent ARCR for repairable full-thickness rotator cuff tears with at least 2 years of follow-up. Twelve predictors were entered as candidate predictors in each model: age, sex, workers' compensation (WC) status, previous cuff repair, tear size, tear shape, multiple-tendon involvement, tendon stump length, Goutallier classification, critical shoulder angle, length of follow-up, and baseline subjective outcomes score. Postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), 12-Item Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Summary (SF-12 PCS), QuickDASH (short version of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand), and patient satisfaction were each modeled through proportional odds ordinal logistic regression. Model results were presented with marginal covariate effect plots and predictive nomograms. RESULTS: Overall, 552 shoulders fit inclusion criteria. The mean age at surgery was 60.2 years (range, 23-81 years). Twenty-five (4.5%) shoulders underwent revision cuff repair or reverse arthroplasty at a mean 1.9 years (range, 0.1-7.9 years) postoperatively. Overall, 509 shoulders were eligible for follow-up, and minimum 2-year postoperative patient-reported outcomes were obtained for 449 (88.2%) at a mean 4.8 years (range, 2-11 years). The ASES score demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to postoperative median (interquartile range): 58 (44.9-71.6) to 98.3 (89.9-100; P < .001). Women demonstrated significantly higher 2-year reoperation rates than men (5.8% vs 1.6%; odds ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 0.73-9.6]; P = .023). Independently significant predictors for lower postoperative ASES scores included previous ARCR (P < .001), female sex (P < .001), and a WC claim (P < .001). Significant predictors for worse QuickDASH scores included WC claim (P < .001), female sex (P < .001), previous ARCR (P = .007), and >=7 years of follow-up time. Significant predictors for lower SF-12 PCS scores included WC claim (P < .001), female sex (P = .001), and lower baseline SF-12 PCS. Last, significant independent predictors of patient satisfaction included previous ARCR (P = .004), WC claim (P = .011), female sex (P = .041), and age (P = .041). CONCLUSION: Excellent clinical outcomes and low failure rates were obtained after ARCR by using careful patient selection and modern surgical techniques for ARCR. Female sex, WC claim, and previous ARCR were significant predictors of poorer outcomes in at least 3 patient-reported outcome models. Prognostic nomograms were developed to aid in future patient selection, clinical decision making, and patient education.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the association between time from the diagnosis of rotator cuff tear to repair and the rate of subsequent revision surgery for re-tear. A national insurance database was queried from 2007 to 2016 for patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair after a diagnosis of rotator cuff tear with minimum 5-year follow-up. On the basis of time from diagnosis to repair, patients were stratified into an early (<6 weeks), a routine (between 6 weeks and 12 months), or a delayed (>12 months) repair cohort. The rates of subsequent revision rotator cuff repair were compared pairwise between cohorts with Pearson's chi-square tests. Multivariate logistic regression was used to adjust for patient demographics and comorbidity burden. A total of 2759 patients were included, with 1510 (54.7%) undergoing early repair, 1104 (40.0%) undergoing routine repair, and 145 (5.3%) having delayed repair. The overall revision rate at 5-year follow-up was 9.6%. The revision rate was higher in the delayed group (15.2%) relative to the early (9.9%) and routine (8.3%) groups (P=.048 and P=.007, respectively). On multivariate analysis, delayed repair was associated with increased odds of revision surgery (odds ratio, 1.97; P=.009) compared with routine repair. Delayed rotator cuff repair beyond 12 months of diagnosis was associated with an increased risk of undergoing subsequent revision rotator cuff repair while controlling for age and comorbidity burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural history of small, symptomatic rotator cuff tears is currently unclear. The purpose of the present study was to assess the clinical and structural outcomes for a consecutive series of patients with symptomatic, isolated full-thickness supraspinatus tears who had been offered rotator cuff repair but declined operative treatment. METHODS: In the study period, twenty-four patients with isolated full-thickness supraspinatus tears that had been diagnosed by means of magnetic resonance arthrography were offered rotator cuff repair and elected nonoperative treatment. The twenty men and four women had an average age of fifty-two years at the time of diagnosis. At a median of forty-two months after the diagnosis, all patients were reexamined clinically according to the Constant and Murley scoring system and all shoulders underwent standard magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: At the time of follow-up, the mean subjective shoulder score was 74% of that for a normal shoulder and the mean Constant score was 75 points (relative Constant score, 86%). The mean rotator cuff tear size did not change significantly over time (95% confidence interval, 0.51 to 1.12). In two shoulders, the tear was no longer detectable on magnetic resonance imaging, in nine shoulders the tear was smaller than it had been at the time of the initial diagnosis, in nine patients the tear had not changed, and in six patients the tear had increased in size. There was a slight but significant progression of fatty muscle infiltration of the supraspinatus, but no patient had fatty infiltration beyond stage 2 at the time of the latest follow-up (95% confidence interval, 0% to 14%). CONCLUSIONS: In a consecutive series of patients who had been offered repair of an isolated, symptomatic supraspinatus tear, the refusal of operative treatment resulted in surprisingly high clinical patient satisfaction and no increase of the average size of the rotator cuff tear 3.5 years after the recommendation of operative repair. This study confirms that the size of small rotator cuff tears does not invariably increase over a limited period of time. Distinguishing tears that will increase in size from those that will not needs further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No evaluation has been done on the relationship of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) with retear after rotator cuff repair. Our purpose was to evaluate whether a higher CSA is associated with retear after rotator cuff repair. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 76 patients who had undergone rotator cuff repair with postoperative ultrasound examination. Ultrasound findings were graded no retear (NT), partial-thickness (PT) retear, or full-thickness (FT) retear. Preoperative radiographs were used to measure CSA, glenoid inclination, lateral acromion angle, and acromion index. RESULTS: Average age was 61.9 years (45.3-74.9 years). On ultrasound examination, 57 shoulders (74.0%) had NT, 11 (14.2%) had PT retears, and 8 (10.3%) had FT retears. There was no significant difference in retear rate by age, gender, or tension of repair. Average CSA was significantly lower for the NT group at 34.3degree +/- 2.9degree than for the FT group at 38.6degree +/- 3.5degree (P < .01). If CSA was >38degree, the odds ratio of having an FT retear was 14.8 (P < .01). In addition, higher CSA inversely correlated with postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (P < .03). Average glenoid inclination was significantly lower in the NT group at 12.3degree +/- 2.7degree compared with 17.3degree +/- 2.6degree in the FT group (P < .01). If glenoid inclination was >14, the odds ratio of having a FT retear was 15.0 (P < .01). CONCLUSION: At short-term follow-up, higher CSA significantly increased the risk of an FT retear after rotator cuff repair. Also, increasing CSA correlated with worse postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores. This radiographic marker may help manage expectations for rotator cuff tear patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperlipidemia (HL) has been identified as a risk factor for rotator cuff tear, but no studies have evaluated its effects on healing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of HL and statin use on rotator cuff healing after arthroscopic repair. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 85 patients (86 shoulders) who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with postoperative ultrasound evaluation. Ultrasound findings were graded no retear, partial-thickness retear (PT), or full-thickness retear (FT). RESULTS: Average age was 62.1 years (45.3-74.3 years). On ultrasound evaluation, 65 shoulders (75.5%) had no retear, 14 (16.3%) had PT, and 7 (8.1%) had FT. There was no significant difference in retear rate by age, technique, or tissue quality. There were 33 patients (38.8%) who had the diagnosis of HL, and all were taking a statin medication. Compared with patients without HL, patients with HL had significantly higher rates of FT (18.1% vs. 1.9%; P < .001) and PT (27.2% vs. 9.4%; P < .001). The total retear rate (PT and FT) for HL patients was significantly higher at 45.5% (15/33) compared with the patients without HL at 11.3% (6/53), with an odds ratio of 6.5 (P < .001). There was no difference in retear rate by dosage or type of statin mediation. CONCLUSION: After arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, HL was a risk factor for retear. Further investigation is warranted on this topic, and these results may help in managing expectations after surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated clinical and structural outcomes after transosseous (TO) repair. The purpose of this study was to compare structural and clinical outcomes of rotator cuff tear, repaired arthroscopically, with a single row (SR) or transossoeus (TO) anchorless technique. METHODS: 96 patients who underwent an arthroscopic repair for superior or posterosuperior rotator cuff tear using TO (n:54) or a SR (n:42) were retrospectively enrolled in this study after evaluation of clinical and surgical notes. Functional evaluation was performed with the adjusted Constant score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Postoperative cuff integrity was determined through MRI study. RESULTS: Patients were recalled after a minimum follow-up of two years. All the patients were available for the study. In the SR group the Constant rating system showed a significant improvement from a preoperative average rating of 44.8 to an average of 85.7. In the group of TO repair the Constant rating system showed a significant improvement from a preoperative average of 46.1 to an average of 87.6 postoperatively. According to ASES index scores, the average total score improved from 42.8 to 92.0 in the anchor group and from 40.4 to 94.6 in the TO group. There was no statistical difference between the two groups about clinical outcomes. Postoperative MRI revealed no differences in term of complete re-tears between the two techniques. In the SR group at MRI we observe significant more cases of rotator cuff with a Sugaya type III healing. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair yielded successful clinical outcomes using SR and TO technique. However using the TO technique we saw less type 3 Sugaya readings on MRI suggesting a possible benefit with TO repair. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE II: Retrospective study.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of knotless repair with flat-braided suture in full small-sized supraspinatus tendon tears (< 1 cm). METHODS: A consecutive series of 54 patients with isolated small supraspinatus tendon tear (< 1 cm and Goutallier index < 2) was evaluated in the study. Patients underwent a knotless arthroscopic repair using flat-braided suture (2 mm wide). Minimal follow-up required was 5 years. Changes in Murley-Constant score, ASES score, strength, and pain relief were assessed. The Sugaya score was used to confirm the tendon repair on MRI. Data were analyzed in two subgroups: technique with additional U point for dog ear deformity (group 1) and technique without additional U point (group 2). The immobilization period was 3 weeks long. Passive mobilization was immediate. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included. Mean age was 57 +/- 4 years. The average follow-up was 68 +/- 10 months. Average preoperative score of Constant was 51.2 +/- 8.5 and 83.1 +/- 14.6 at the end of the follow-up (p < 0.001). Mean VAS went from 5.8 +/- 1.8 to 1.9 +/- 2.1 (p < 0.001). Average forward elevation of the shoulder went from 86.3degree +/- 9 preoperatively to 169.6degree +/- 15.9 at the end of the follow-up (p < 0.001). The strength score was significantly higher post-operatively (18.4 vs. 8.3, p < 0.001.). The ASES score was significantly improved 49.1 +/- 13.1 vs. 88.6 +/- 15.8, p < 0.001). The MRI assessment revealed 94% of Sugaya 1-2. No significant difference was observed between group 1 and 2 regarding all clinical outcomes. Two complex regional pain syndromes were described with a favorable evolution. Three patients presented a retear requiring an iterative arthroscopic repair. CONCLUSION: The use of a knotless arthroscopic construct with flat-braided suture for small supraspinatus repair achieved excellent structural and clinical results. This technique is fully adequate for the arthroscopic treatment of such tears, enabling early mobilization. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether arthroscopic lateral acromioplasty reliably decreases the critical shoulder angle (CSA) and whether it is associated with damage to the deltoid or other complications. METHODS: Patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) with lateral but without anterior acromioplasty for degenerative, full-thickness rotator cuff tears and a CSA of 34degree or greater were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with traumatic or irreparable rotator cuff tears, osteoarthritis, or previous surgery were excluded. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed at a minimum of 12 months' follow-up. RESULTS: We reviewed 49 consecutive patients (mean age, 56 years; age range, 39-76 years) at a mean of 30 months (range, 12-47 months). There were 7 RCR failures (14%). The mean CSA was reduced from 37.5degree preoperatively (95% confidence interval [CI], 36.7degree-38.3degree) to 33.9degree postoperatively (95% CI, 33.3degree-34.6degree; P < .001). There were no cases of dehiscence, increases in fatty infiltration, or significant atrophy of the deltoid. Scarring at the deltoid origin was noted in 18 patients (37%). The mean absolute and relative Constant scores increased from 59 points (95% CI, 54-64 points) to 74 points (95% CI, 70-78 points) and from 66% (95% CI, 61%-71%) to 83% (95% CI, 79%-87%) respectively, and the Subjective Shoulder Value increased from 45% (95% CI, 39%-50%) to 80% (95% CI, 74%-86%) (P < .001 for all 3 improvements). The postoperative CSA was significantly larger in failed than in healed repairs (P = .026). Patients with a healed RCR and a CSA corrected to 33degree or less (n = 22) had 25% more abduction strength than patients with a healed cuff and a CSA corrected to 35degree or greater (n = 14, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic lateral acromioplasty performed in addition to arthroscopic RCR can reduce the CSA without significantly compromising the deltoid origin, deltoid muscle, or function. It is not associated with any additional complications of arthroscopic RCR. Insufficiently corrected, abnormally large CSAs are associated either with a higher retear rate or with inferior strength of abduction if the tears heal. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, case series, treatment study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic double-row fixation of supraspinatus tendon tears compared with single-row techniques is still a matter of debate. HYPOTHESIS: Arthroscopic double-row rotator cuff repair using the suture bridge technique provides better clinical results and lower retear rates than does single-row repair using a modified Mason-Allen stitch technique. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence 3. METHODS: Forty patients underwent either an arthroscopic single-row modified Mason-Allen stitch (SR) (n = 20; mean age +/- SD, 61.5 +/- 7.4 y) or a modified suture bridge double-row repair (DR) (n = 20; age, 61.2 +/- 7.5 y). The anteroposterior extension was classified as Bateman I in 10% and Bateman II in 90% of patients in the SR group and as Bateman II in 80% and Bateman III in 20% of patients in the DR group. Patients were matched for sex and age. The subjective shoulder value (SSV), Constant-Murley score (CS), and Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) were used for clinical follow-up. Furthermore, MRI scans were conducted for analysis of tendon integrity, muscle atrophy, and fatty infiltration via semiquantitative signal intensity analysis. In addition, re-defect patterns were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time in the SR group was 16.8 +/- 4.6 months. The mean SSV was 91.0% +/- 8.8%, mean CS was 82.2 +/- 8.1 (contralateral side, 88.8 +/- 5.3), and mean WORC score was 96.5% +/- 3.2%. The mean follow-up time in the DR group was 23.4 +/- 2.9 months, with patients achieving scores of 92.9% +/- 9.6% for the SSV, 77.0 +/- 8.6 for the CS (contralateral side, 76.7 +/- 17.1), and 90.7% +/- 12.6% for the WORC (P > .05). No significant differences were detected in the clinical outcome between groups. Tendon integrity was as follows. Type 1, none in either group; type 2, 4 SR and 5 DR; type 3, 9 SR and 10 DR; type 4, 3 SR and 3 DR; and type 5, 3 SR and 2 DR. The failure rate was 31.6% (n = 6) in the SR group and 25% (n = 5) in the DR group (P > .05). No significant differences were obtained for muscular atrophy or fatty degeneration (SR group, 0.94 +/- 0.16; DR group, 1.15 +/- 0.5) (P > .05). Re-defects revealed lateral cuff failure in 83.3% of SR patients in contrast to patients treated with DR techniques. The re-defect pattern was medial cuff failure in 80% of the patients. CONCLUSION: The clinical results after modified Mason-Allen single-row versus double-mattress suture bridge technique did not demonstrate significant differences in a matched patient cohort. Concerning the failure mode, single- and double-row techniques seem to demonstrate different re-defect patterns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The double-row rotator cuff repair is discussed controversially. Despite improved biomechanical properties, reduced re-tear rates and higher costs, no significant difference compared to single-row fixation in the clinical results is found. Mid-term results of an open double-row fixation with titanium anchor screws are presented. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 237 patients (m = 142, f = 95, median age: 56.3 years) were operated in 2007 with this technique by the senior author (M. G.). Preoperatively, 2 years and 4,5 years postoperatively a subjective shoulder score (SSG) with follow-up rates of 86, 87 and 83 %, was evaluated. 5.1 years postoperatively an objective evaluation of 131 patients using the Constant-Murley scores (CS), the simple shoulder tests (SST), Gerber's shoulder value and the evaluation with school grades followed. The integrity of the cuff was checked with ultrasound. The absolute (re-tears and partial re-tears) and the relative (re-tears, partial re-tears, thinning and thickening of the cuff) re-tear rates were evaluated. RESULTS: In SSG a highly significant improvement from 51 to 83 points was found (p < 0.001). In CS 80 points (min.: 18; max.: 100), and in SST 11 points (min.: 2; max.: 12) were achieved. The shoulder value of Gerber increased significantly from preoperative 28.1 to 84.5 % 5.1 years postoperative (p < 0.001). The absolute re-tear rate, evaluated in ultrasound was 7.6 %, the relative re-tear rate 17.6 %. For primary rotator cuff reconstructions a higher CS with 82 points and a lower relative re-tear rate with 10.5 % were found. The patient's age had no significant influence on the clinical outcome. The rupture size showed a significant impact on the re-tear rate and the scores (p < 0.05). Between the operated and healthy shoulder neither strength nor mobility were found to be significantly different. Men reached a highly significant better strength than women (p < 0.001) which also resulted in a significantly better outcome in the CS (p < 0.01). The costs for open titanium transfixation technique with 330 per case are markedly less than for arthroscopic suture bridge technique with 600 to 1000 per case. CONCLUSION: Open double-row cuff repair with titanium screws is a safe and cost effective technique with a low re-tear rate with comparable clinical results regarding open and arthroscopic procedures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatty infiltration (FI) compromises outcomes of rotator cuff repairs. Most clinicians consider FI of the infraspinatus, whether it is torn or intact, because it is most rapidly affected. The purpose of this study was to report long-term outcomes of isolated supraspinatus repairs and to determine their associations with FI of the infraspinatus and supraspinatus. METHODS: The records of 182 patients who underwent repair of isolated supraspinatus tears and had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging were retrieved. Of these, 147 patients were evaluated at 10 years' follow-up using the Constant score and magnetic resonance imaging scans. RESULTS: Preoperative FI was greater in the supraspinatus (52% stage >=1) than in the infraspinatus (29% stage >=1). The 10-year Constant scores were influenced by FI of the supraspinatus (P = .006) but not of the infraspinatus (P = .422). Multivariable regression confirmed that Constant scores were significantly lower for female patients, repetitive work, and stage 1 and stage 2 FI of the supraspinatus in addition to open surgery. Retear rates (Sugaya types IV-V) were also influenced by FI of the supraspinatus (P = .001) but not of the infraspinatus (P = .979). Shoulders with supraspinatus FI at stages 0, 1, and 2 had retear rates of 10%, 22%, and 31%, respectively. Multivariable regression affirmed that the odds of retears are significantly increased by both stage 1 and stage 2 FI of the supraspinatus. CONCLUSIONS: The Constant scores and retear rates were significantly associated with FI of the torn supraspinatus (stage >=1) but not of the intact infraspinatus. The authors recommend that rapid surgical intervention be considered, before accumulation of fat, especially for young, active patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the functional and anatomical results from surgical treatment via arthroscopy in cases of complete rupture of the rotator cuff, using ultrasound images and the Constant and Murley functional index to investigate the correlation between them. METHODS: 100 patients (110 shoulders) were evaluated. The mean follow-up was 48.8 +/- 33.28 months (12 to 141 months). The mean age was 60.25 +/- 10.09 (36 to 81 years). Rupture of the supraspinal tendon alone occurred in 85 cases (77%), and in association with the infraspinatus in 20 cases (18%) and subscapularis in four shoulders (4%). An association of supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis lesions was found in one shoulder (1%). The lesions were classified according to DeOrio and Cofield scores as small/medium in 85 shoulders (77%) and large/extensive in 25 (23%). The clinical results were assessed in accordance with the Constant and Murley criteria. The ultrasound results relate to reports issued by different radiologists. Statistical analysis was carried out using the chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Student's t test, Pearson's correlation, Kruskal-Wallis correlation and logistic regression (significance: p < 0.05). RESULTS: The mean Constant evaluation was 85.3 +/- 10.06 in the normal shoulders and 83.96 +/- 8.67 in the operated shoulders (p = 0.224). Excellent and good results were found in 74 shoulders (67%), satisfactory and moderate results in 32 (29%) and poor results in four (4%). The ultrasound evaluation showed 38 shoulders with re-rupture (35%) and absence of rupture in 71 (65%). Among the 74 shoulders (67%) with excellent/good results, 22 (30%) presented re-rupture in the ultrasound report (p = 0.294). Among the four shoulders (4%) with poor results, two (50%) presented reports of intact tendons (p = 0.294). CONCLUSION: There was no statistically valid correlation between the ultrasound diagnosis and the clinical evaluation of results among the patients who underwent arthroscopic repair to treat full tear lesions of the rotator cuff. The clinical results from the complete rotator cuff repairs via arthroscopy presented a high level of functional recovery (Constant 83.96), compared with the contralateral shoulder. The postoperative ultrasound reports presented a high percentage of re-rupture (35%). Postoperative strength was greater among the patients aged under 60 years (p = 0.002) and in cases of lesions less than or equal to 3 cm (p = 0.003).

AB  - PURPOSE: The role of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in ruptured rotator cuff tendons remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the gene expression of MMPs in ruptured rotator cuff tendons and to compare their expression levels between patients with and without postoperative tendon retear. METHODS: Twenty-four patients (a median age of 61 years: interquartile range, 55-66 years) with full-thickness rotator cuff tears were examined in this study. The marginal site of the ruptured tendon was harvested during surgery. The mRNA expression levels of collagen types I and III, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-13, tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 were analysed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Postoperative retear was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging at a minimum of 1 year following surgery. RESULTS: The mRNA expression levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in ruptured rotator cuff tendons were significantly increased in patients with postoperative retear (n = 6), compared with patients without retear (n = 18) (P = 0.04). For collagens, MMP-1, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-13, and TIMP-2, there were no significant differences in the mRNA expression levels in ruptured tendons between patients with and without retear. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, in addition to up-regulation of TIMP-1 gene expression, increased MMP-3 gene expression in ruptured rotator cuff tendons is associated with postoperative tendon retear. Thus, drug therapy specifically targeting MMP-3 after rotator cuff repair should be considered in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to evaluate the outcome of the open repair of rotator cuff tears via the deltopectoral approach in patients unable to afford arthroscopic repair costs. METHODS: We evaluated 80 consecutive patients who were treated for full-thickness rotator cuff tears by open repair through the deltopectoral approach. There were 48 men and 32 women at a mean age of 60.1 years (range, 35-80 years). Preoperative and postoperative clinical assessments were performed with the Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, modified University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and pain visual analog scale. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 30.6 months (range, 18-48 months). At final follow-up visits, the ASES, Constant score, and modified UCLA score were found to have improved significantly from 33.56, 39.24, and 13.0 to 85.64, 81.46, and 32.2, respectively (P <0.01). Pain, as measured on a visual analog scale, was improved significantly (P <0.01). The mean time for recovering the full range of motion was 2.5 months. Postoperative pain at 48 hours and at 6 weeks was relatively low. There were no cases of intractable stiffness. CONCLUSION: The deltopectoral approach for open rotator cuff repair produced satisfactory results and reduces rate of shoulder stiffness and postoperative pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of postoperative pain in incidence of shoulder stiffness (SS) after shoulder arthroscopy has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study was conducted to assess the effects of early postoperative pain (EPOP) on onset of SS after arthroscopic rotator cuff (RC) repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database, 335 patients who underwent arthroscopic RC repair were evaluated. RC tendons were sutured to the bone using the double-row technique. EPOP was evaluated 1 week after surgery using the visual analog scale (VAS). SS was assessed 3 months after surgery and was categorized into moderate or severe based on shoulder range of motion (ROM). Each type of complication including SS was identified and recorded. RESULTS: Postoperative shoulder stiffness (POSS) was identified in 121 patients (36.2%) that was moderate in 86 patients (70.1%) and severe in 35 patients (28.9%). After 1 week, VAS pain score was equal to 7.7 +/- 3.1 and 4.5 +/- 2.1 in the patients with and without stiffness, respectively (p < 0.001). Diabetes and traumatic tear were found to be associated with postoperative stiffness (p = 0.046 and p < 0.001, respectively). Similar associations were found on multivariate analysis of data. VAS pain score was higher in the patients with severe stiffness compared with those with moderate stiffness (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that EPOP is associated with shoulder stiffness after arthroscopic RC repair. Therefore, strategies to ameliorate EPOP could be opted to decrease rate of POSS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional outcomes after a novel method of H-loop knotless double-row technique in patients with rotator cuff tears. METHOD: From June 2020 to September 2020, a total of six patients (five women, one man) with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using the H-loop knotless double-row technique were enrolled in our study. The average age is 54 years (range: 50-61 years). The preoperative and final follow-up clinical outcome were evaluated using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, visual analog scale (VAS), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and Constant-Murley score. The active shoulder range of motion (ROM) was also collected preoperatively and postoperatively at the final follow-up (forward flexion and abduction). Accordingly, intraoperative and postoperative complications were observed as well. RESULT: There were six patients that underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using the H-loop knotless double-row technique. The average follow-up period was 7.52 +/- 0.70 months. The VAS, UCLA, ASES, and Constant-Murley scores improved from 5 +/- 2.45, 15.67 +/- 3.44, 47.67 +/- 17.41 and 49.17 +/- 8.98 preoperatively, to 0.83 +/- 0.75, 36.27 +/- 3.83, 91.67 +/- 10.76 and 85.83 +/- 4.31 at the final follow-up, with statistical significances of P = 0.009, P < 0.001, P = 0.006, and P = 0.001, respectively. Meanwhile, the active shoulder ROM (forward flexion and abduction) improved from 135.00 +/- 46.80 and 125 +/- 56.48 preoperatively, to 173.67 +/- 4.13 and 172 +/- 3.27 at final follow-up, respectively (P = 0.082, P = 0.088). During the follow-up, there were no postoperative complications such as wound-site infection, nerve or vessel damage, subcutaneous hematoma, and suture anchor problems. CONCLUSION: With the benefit of reducing the possibility of strangulation and blood supply affection for the rotator cuff, The H-loop knotless double row technique may be an alternative method to significantly improve subjective functional outcomes and increase the healing rate of medium-sized rotator cuff tears with degeneration issues and poor tissue quality.

AB  - The authors aimed to investigate whether standard acromioplasty can reduce critical shoulder angle (CSA) effectively and to investigate the effects of postoperative CSA on the clinical outcomes and retear rates. Patients are divided in to three groups: group 1 (24 patients): CSA under 35degree before surgery, group 2 (25 patients): CSA over 35degree before surgery and under 35degree after surgery and group 3 (17 patients): CSA over 35degree before and after surgery. Standard acromioplasty was performed if CSA is over 35 and no acromioplasty was performed if the CSA is already under 35. Preoperative and postoperative CSAs, UCLA, Constant-Murley clinical score and visual analog scale (VAS) pain score were measured. The size of the rotator cuff tear was classified by the Patte classification in preoperative MRI and the quality of the repair was evaluated as retear if discontinuity detected in the postoperative first year MRI. There were 31 female and 35 male patients with a mean age of 59.3 +/- 4.5 years (range, 48-68) at the time of surgery. The mean CSA is reduced from 37.8degree +/- 1.4 to 34.9degree +/- 1.2 (p < 0.001) significantly for patients who underwent acromioplasty. In 25 (59.5%) of the 42 patients, the CSA was reduced to under 35degree, whereas in the other 17 (40.5%) patients, it remained over 35degree. The mean Constant and UCLA score was 46.4 +/- 6.6; 18.5 +/- 1.6 preoperatively and 82.4 +/- 6.2; 31.1 +/- 1.9 postoperatively respectively (p < 0,001). The mean VAS decreased from 4.94 +/- 1.09 to 0.79 +/- 0.71 (p < 0.001). No Clinical difference was seen between patients in which CSA could be reduced under 35degree or not in terms of Constant-Murley score, UCLA and VAS score. Retear was observed in 2 (8.3%) patients in group 1, in 4 (16%) patients in group 2 and in 3 patients (17.6%) in group 3. There was not any significant difference between the patients who had retear or not in terms of neither the CSA values nor the change of CSA after the surgery. Standard acromioplasty, which consists of an anterolateral acromial resection, can reduce CSA by approximately 3degree. This is not always sufficient to decrease the CSAs to the favorable range of 30degree-35degree. In addition, its effect on clinical outcomes does not seem to be noteworthy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare the clinical results and repair integrity of two of the commonly used transosseous-equivalent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair techniques, which are the knotless and the medial knotted suture bridge, for patients with full-thickness medium to large-sized rotator cuff tears. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 121 patients (55 males, 66 females; mean age 56.7+/-7.3 years; range, 39 to 72 years) with cuff tears. In total, 64 shoulders were operated on using the conventional medial knotted suture bridge technique (group A) and 57 shoulders were operated on using the knotless suture bridge technique (group B). The Constant score, visual analog scale (VAS) and active forward flexion angle were assessed preoperatively and after a minimum of 12 months postoperatively. Postoperative rotator cuff integrity was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after a mean of 19+/-4.7 months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index, and anteroposterior extension of the tear on the sagittal MRIs. Postoperatively, the mean Constant score increased from 32.3+/-8.5 points to 84+/-11.6 points in group A and from 31.3+/-9.3 points to 86.4+/-8.7 points in group B (p<0.001), while the mean VAS score decreased from 6.0+/-1.0 to 1.3+/-1.2 in group A and from 6.4+/-1.0 to 1.0+/-0.8 in group B (p<0.001). According to the control MRIs, the re-tear rate was 10.9% (n=7) in group A and 8.8% (n=5) in group B. No statistically significant difference was found in either the clinical scores or re-tear rates between the groups (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: In comparison to the medial knotted technique, less time-consuming and simpler knotless technique provides similar satisfactory outcomes after a minimum of one year postoperatively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extension of delamination and the cuff integrity after arthroscopic repair of delaminated rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with delaminated rotator cuff tears were retrospectively reviewed. The delaminated tears were divided into full-thickness delaminated tears and partial-thickness delaminated tears. To evaluate the medial extension, we calculated the coronal size of the delaminated portion. To evaluate the posterior extension, we checked the tendon involved. Cuff integrity was evaluated by computed tomography arthrography. RESULTS: The mean medial extension in the full-thickness and partial-thickness delaminated tears was 18.1 +/- 6.0 mm and 22.7 +/- 6.3 mm, respectively (P = .0084). The posterior extension into the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus was 36.9% and 32.3%, respectively, in the full-thickness delaminated tears, and it was 27.7% and 3.1%, respectively, in the partial-thickness delaminated tears (P = .0043). With regard to cuff integrity, 35 cases of anatomic healing, 10 cases of partial healing defects, and 17 cases of retear were detected. Among the patients with retear and partial healing of the defect, all the partially healed defects showed delamination. Three retear patients showed delamination, and 14 retear patients did not show delamination; the difference was statistically significant (P = .0001). CONCLUSION: The full-thickness delaminated tears showed less medial extension and more posterior extension than the partial-thickness delaminated tears. Delamination did not develop in retear patients, but delamination was common in the patients with partially healed defects.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the structural and clinical outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) of a case group aged 70 and above with those of a control group younger than 70, with the 2 groups matched for sex and tear size. METHODS: The case group, comprising 53 patients 70 or older, and the control group, comprising 159 patients younger than 70, all received ARCR to 1 shoulder with symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tear. The case and the control subjects, who were matched for sex and tear size to minimize bias related to tendon healing, received ARCR during the same period. The mean age was 71.8 +/- 2.6 years in the case group and 59.3 +/- 7.1 years in the control group. The minimum follow-up period was 1 year in both groups. Cuff integrity was evaluated using ultrasonography. Structural and clinical outcomes of the 2 groups were compared. RESULTS: Regarding structural outcomes, the complete healing, partial-thickness retear, and full-thickness retear rates were 66% (35/53), 15% (8/53), and 19% (10/53) in the case group, and 68% (108/159), 19% (30/159), and 13% (21/159), respectively, in the control group. The 2 groups had no significantly different retear rates (P = .52). Regarding clinical outcomes, the mean improvements in range of motion, pain, muscle strength, and age- and sex-matched Constant scores were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P > .37). The preoperative tear size was significantly associated with retear in both studied groups (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical and structural outcomes of ARCR in patients 70 or older with symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tear are comparable with those in patients younger than 70 with at least 1-year follow-up. Preoperative tear size, a biological factor, is a strong predictor for retear. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, a retrospective comparative (case-control) study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Failure rates after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair remain high. Platelet-rich plasma has gained interest as a potential biological augmentation to enhance bone-tendon healing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical and structural outcomes of repeated PRP application on rotator cuff repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients underwent arthroscopic reconstruction, using knotless anchor double-row repair. Eighteen patients [10 female, 8 male; 61.2 (+/-9.2) years] received two applications of PRP-directly subsequent to the repair and 7 days postoperatively. Eighteen patients [11 male, 7 female; 61.4 (+/-6.5) years] who solely received the same technique of rotator cuff repair were matched for age. The subjective shoulder value, WORC, and the Constant-Murley score were used for clinical evaluation. MRI was performed for tendon integrity, and cuff appearances were graded according to the Sugaya classification. RESULTS: We prospectively evaluated the PRP group with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Clinical results did not show significantly differences in comparison to patients with isolated rotator cuff repair concerning CS (79 +/- 13 vs. 77 +/- 13; P = 0.6), SSV (90 +/- 14 vs. 88 +/- 16; P = 0.5) or WORC Score (90 +/- 18 vs. 86 +/- 20; P = 0.2). At the final follow-up, MRI showed retears in 11 % of the PRP and in 28 % of the control group (P = 0.4). CONCLUSIONS: Knotless-anchor double-row repair shows good to excellent clinical results with an acceptable retear rate. Additional two-staged PRP application failed to significantly improve clinical parameters. Even though there was a trend for lower retear rates in the PRP group, it did not achieve statistical difference. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Retrospective comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare the clinical outcomes of steroid injections during the rehabilitation period after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ACRC). METHODS: Among patients who underwent ARCR, 117 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled. Pain and range of motion (ROM) recovery at the 3-, 6-, and 24-month follow-up visits and functional outcome at the 24-month follow-up were compared between 45 patients who received ultrasound-guided subacromial steroid injection at postoperative week 4 or 6 and 72 patients who did not. Functional outcome was assessed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and Constant score. Healing of the repaired tendon and retear were observed at the 6-month follow-up via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) arthrography. RESULTS: At the 3-month follow-up, the steroid injection group showed lower visual analog scale scores than the control group (p<0.05) and showed faster recovery of forward flexion and internal rotation (p<0.05). From the 6-month follow-up, the two groups did not show differences in pain and ROM, and the ASES score and Constant score also did not significantly differ at the 24-month follow-up. The two groups did not differ in retear rate as determined by MRI or CT arthrography at the 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ultrasound-guided subacromial steroid injection at 4 or 6 weeks after ARCR leads to quick pain reduction and ROM recovery until 3 months after surgery. Therefore, subacromial steroid injection is speculated to be an effective and relatively safe method to assist rehabilitation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of asymptomatic hyperuricemia on the effectiveness of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Methods: The clinical data of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and met the selection criteria between March 2018 and December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. According to the serum uric acid level, the patients were divided into hyperuric acid group (46 cases, the serum uric acid level was more than 417 mumol/L in males and was more than 357 mumol/L in females) and normal group (34 cases, serum uric acid level was lower than the above standard). There was no significant difference in gender, age, side, body mass index, blood glucose level, total cholesterol level, rotator cuff tear size, and preoperative shoulder motion, visual analogue scale (VAS) score, University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) score, Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and other general data between the two groups ( P>0.05). The range of motion of abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation at 90degree abduction were recorded and compared between the two groups before operation and at last follow-up; the improvement of shoulder pain was evaluated by VAS score; the improvement of shoulder function was evaluated by UCLA score, Constant score, and ASES score; and the shoulder joint MRI grade was evaluated according to Sugaya evaluation criteria. Results: All patients were followed up 9-16 months, with an average of 11.9 months; there was no significant difference in the follow-up time between the two groups ( t=0.968, P=0.336). There were 2 cases of retear in the hyperuric acid group (including 1 case of severe tear) and 1 case of light retear in the normal group. The remaining patients in the two groups had no early-related complications. At last follow-up, the range of motion of the shoulder joints (abduction, forward flexion, external rotation at 90degree abduction), VAS score, UCLA score, Constant score, and ASES score of the two groups were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones ( P<0.05); the above indicators in the normal group were significantly better than those in the hyperuric acid group ( P<0.05). The MRI grade of the shoulder joint in the normal group was significantly better than that in the hyperuric acid group ( Z=-2.000, P=0.045). Conclusion: Compared with patients with normal serum uric acid level, asymptomatic hyperuricemia can lead to worse recovery after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in patients with rotator cuff tears.

AB  - Introduction: Rotator cuff tears are one of the most common injuries worldwide, yet it is difficult to predict which patients will have poor outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). The purpose of this study was to identify an association between preoperative vitamin D (25D) levels and postoperative complications in arthroscopic RCR. Methods: From a national claims database, patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR with preoperative 25D levels were reviewed. Patients were stratified into 25D-sufficient (>=20 ng/dL) or 25D-deficient (<20 ng/dL) categories and examined for development of postoperative complications. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) as covariates. From this, risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated comparing complications between the two groups. Results: One thousand eight hundred eighty-one patients with measured preoperative 25D levels were identified; 229 patients were 25D deficient (12.2%). After adjusting for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, 25D-deficient patients had increased odds of revision RCR (OR 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.97, P < 0.001) and stiffness requiring manipulation under anesthesia (OR 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.03, P = 0.035). Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a greater risk of postoperative surgical complications after arthroscopic RCR and may be a modifiable risk factor. Further investigation on preoperative vitamin D repletion is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several risk factors for postoperative retear after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) have been cited in a large number of reports; various combinations of these seem to be present in the clinical setting. PURPOSE: Using a combination model for decision tree analysis, we aimed to investigate the combination of risk factors that affect postoperative retear the most. METHODS: A total of 286 patients who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at 6 months after surgery were included in this study. Based on the structural integrity of the MR images taken 6 months after surgery, the patients were divided into a healed group (intact tendon, 254 patients) and a retear group (ruptured tendon, 32 patients). Using univariate and decision tree analyses, we selected a combination of 11 risk factors that drastically affected postoperative retear. RESULTS: The mean age was 64.9 +/- 7.1 years, and the mean symptom duration was 9.7 +/- 11.6 months. The tear was small/medium in 177 patients and large/massive in 109 patients. The technique for surgical repair was single row in 42 patients, double row in 60 patients, and suture bridging in 216 patients. On univariate analysis, both groups had significant differences in the anteroposterior (AP) tear size (P < .0001), mediolateral tear size (P < .0001), hyperlipidemia (P = .0178), global fatty degeneration index (P < .0001), supraspinatus fatty degeneration stage (P < .0001), and critical shoulder angle (CSA) (P = .0015). All of these 5 risk factors, except for mediolateral tear size, were selected as candidates for the decision tree analysis. Eight combination patterns were determined to have prediction probabilities that ranged from 4.3% to 86.1%. In particular, the combination of an AP tear size of >=40 mm, hyperlipidemia, and a CSA of >=37degree affected retear after ARCR the most. CONCLUSIONS: Decision tree analysis lead to the extraction of different retear factor combinations, which were divided into 5 retear groups. The worst combination was of AP tear size >=40 mm, hyperlipidemia, and CSA >=37degree, and the prediction probability of this combination was 86.2%. Therefore, our data may offer a new index for the prediction of retear after ARCR.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the intra- and inter-rater agreement of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations of rotator cuff integrity at 6 and 24 months after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). METHODS: Three shoulder surgeons reviewed 68 MRI scans from 34 patients who had undergone ARCR and MRI examination at both 6 and 24 months after surgery. Postoperative rotator cuff integrity was investigated by using Owen, Sugaya, and Hayashida classifications to determine whether the rotator cuff was intact or whether there was a partial-thickness retear or full-thickness retear and Burks score to assess tendon appearance. Multirater kappa statistics were used to measure intra- and inter-rater agreement. Kappa values were interpreted according to guidelines adapted from the work of Landis and Koch. RESULTS: All classifications had similar intra- and inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.14 to 0.67, 0.23 to 0.60, respectively), but no intra- or inter-rater agreement scored "excellent." Inter-rater agreement after ARCR was higher at 24 months (kappa = 0.31 to 0.60) than at 6 months (kappa = 0.23 to 0.44) in all evaluations. Reviewers identified full-thickness retears with a moderate to good degree of inter-rater agreement in all evaluations, at both 6 months (kappa = 0.42 to 0.73) and 24 months (kappa = 0.61 to 0.80) after ARCR. However, poor inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.13 to 0.19) was found in the identification of partial-thickness retears in all evaluations at 6 months after ARCR. CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder surgeons showed better intra- and inter-rater agreement in predicting full-thickness tears compared with partial-thickness tears. The inter-rater agreement at 24 months after ARCR was superior to that at 6 months in predicting not only full-thickness retear but also partial-thickness retear. MRI evaluation of rotator cuff integrity at 6 months after ARCR may be less reliable, regardless of which classification system is used. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes and retear rate between arthroscopic double row (DR) and suture bridge (SB) repair for rotator cuff tears. Postoperative Constant score and MRI findings were compared between 52 patients underwent DR repair and 63 patients underwent SB repair with medium tear of the supraspinatus. There was no significant difference in Constant score between the two groups. Postoperative MRI revealed that retear rate of SB group was significantly lower than DR group. This study suggests that SB repair can provide better clinical and structural outcomes compared with DR repair.

AB  - Background: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair techniques have almost replaced open repairs. Short- and mid-term studies have shown comparable outcomes, with no clear superiority of either procedure. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term clinical and imaging outcomes following arthroscopic or open rotator cuff repair. Methods: Forty patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-documented, symptomatic supraspinatus or supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears were randomized to undergo arthroscopic or open rotator cuff repair. Clinical and radiographic follow-up was obtained at 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, and >10 years postoperatively. Clinical assessment included measurement of active range of motion, visual analog scale score for pain, functional scoring according to the Constant-Murley score (CS), and assessment of the Subjective Shoulder Value. Imaging included conventional radiography and MRI for the assessment of cuff integrity and alteration of the deltoid muscle. Results: We enrolled 20 patients with a mean age of 60 years (range, 50-71 years; standard deviation [SD], 6 years) in the arthroscopic surgery group and 20 patients with a mean age of 55 years (range, 39-67 years; SD, 8 years) in the open surgery group. More than 10 years' follow-up was available for 13 patients in the arthroscopic surgery group and 11 patients in the open surgery group, with mean follow-up periods of 13.8 years (range, 11.9-15.2 years; SD, 1.1 years) and 13.1 years (range, 11.7-15 years; SD, 1.1 years), respectively. No statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes were identified between the 2 groups: The median absolute CS was 79 points (range, 14-84 points) in the arthroscopic surgery group and 84 points (range, 56-90 points) in the open surgery group (P = .177). The median relative CS was 94% (range, 20%-99%) and 96% (range, 65%-111%), respectively (P = .429). The median Subjective Shoulder Value was 93% (range, 20%-100%) and 93% (range, 10%-100%), respectively (P = .976). MRI evaluation showed a retear rate of 30% equally distributed between the 2 groups. Neither fatty infiltration of the deltoid muscle, deltoid muscle volume, nor the deltoid origin were different between the 2 groups. Conclusion: In a small cohort of patients, we could not document any difference in clinical and radiographic outcomes at long-term follow-up between arthroscopic and open rotator cuff repair. The postulated harm to the deltoid muscle with the open technique could not be confirmed.

AB  - We report the techniques of mini-open rotator cuff repair for rotator cuff tears and the postoperative outcomes in patients followed up for 10 or more years after surgery. The surgical procedure aimed to repair the torn rotator cuff with transosseous suture through the mini-open deltoid splitting approach. We evaluated 41 shoulders in 39 patients followed up for 10 or more years after surgery, with a mean age of 58.2 years at the time of surgery and mean postoperative follow-up period of 10.8 years. The University of California Los Angeles shoulder scale score significantly improved at 10 years after surgery, and 93% of the patients had excellent or good results. The repeat tear (retear) rate at 10 years after surgery on cuff integrity evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging was 17 %. Favorable shoulder joint function has been maintained over the long term after mini-open rotator cuff repair, and the outcome of the repaired rotator cuff was also favorable. The results suggest that mini-open rotator cuff repair is an effective treatment option for rotator cuff tears. © Springer Japan 2016. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pennation angle is an important architectural and functional feature of pennate muscles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the change in the pennation angle of the supraspinatus muscle after rotator cuff tear repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 68 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and magnetic resonance imaging. The size of the tear was measured under arthroscopic visualization. The pennation angle of the supraspinatus both preoperatively and postoperatively and the integrity of the repaired cuff were determined by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The preoperative pennation angle was significantly greater with enlargement of the tear size (P < .0001, analysis of variance). The retear rate was 29% in patients with medium tears and 59% in patients with large or massive tears. No retear was noted in patients with partial and small tears. The retear rate was 90.9% when the preoperative pennation angle was 20degree or greater and was 12.3% when this angle was 19degree or less, and the risk ratio for retear was 7.4 when this angle was 20degree or greater. For repair-type tears, comparison between the preoperative and postoperative pennation angles showed a significant decrease in the mean value from 11.8degree +/- 3.7degree to 9.9degree +/- 3.0degree in the medium tear group (P = .007, paired t test) but no significant difference in the large or massive tear group (from 15.1degree +/- 7.0degree to 13.3degree +/- 5.8degree) (P = .33). For retear-type tears, no significance was found between groups. CONCLUSION: The preoperative pennation angle is directly correlated with the tear configuration and could be one of the prognostic factors for postoperative cuff integrity. To restore the pennation angle, primary repair is more appropriate in smaller rotator cuff tears than in medium-sized tears.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and elucidate retear pattern and its characteristics after surgical repair of the rotator cuff using an arthroscopic double-row suture anchor (DRSA) method. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with complete rotator cuff tears treated by the DRSA method under arthroscopy whose repair condition was assessed by MRI approximately 12 months after the procedure were included in the study. The mean age at treatment was 65 years (range, 42 to 82 years). The mean follow-up period was 26 months (range, 24 to 32 months). RESULT: The repair integrity was classified into 5 groups according to MRI findings. A well-repaired tendon was seen in 34 shoulders. Partial retearing of the deep layer was observed in 2. Partial retearing of the superficial layer around the medial anchors was observed in 3. Complete retearing of the tendon around the medial anchors with a well-preserved footprint was observed in 4. Complete retearing of the tendon from the footprint was observed in 4. The retear patterns involving superficial retearing and complete retearing around the medial anchors were unexpected and unique. These types of retears seem to be characteristic of the DRSA method and were seen in cases with medium-sized tears. The incidence of characteristic retearing was 7 of 47. CONCLUSIONS: Superficial-side partial tearing and complete tearing around the medial-row anchors with a well-repaired tendon on the footprint could be characteristics of the DRSA method. These retear patterns were observed in 7 of 13 retear cases and 7 of 47 cases overall. The retear rate by the characteristic retear was high. Exploring the causes of this retear and preventing it could lead to better clinical results with the DRSA method. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical results of arthroscopic repair of isolated subscapularis tears at 24 months' follow-up. METHODS: We prospectively followed up 20 patients with isolated subscapularis tears treated with arthroscopic repair with suture anchors in a 3-year period (January 2006 to December 2008) at our institution. Clinical examination of the patients and functional scores (Constant and University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA] scores) were obtained preoperatively and at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postoperatively. MRI and routine radiographs were obtained to evaluate the repair at the last follow-up. RESULTS: Of the patients (mean age, 42 years; age range, 31 to 56 years), 19 (95%) had complete follow-up. Constant and UCLA scores improved significantly after the repair at all postoperative examinations. The Constant score gained 39.7 points to a mean of 81 points (range, 61 to 95 points) at last follow-up, and the UCLA score improved from 16 points to 32 points (range, 25 to 35 points). Of the shoulders, 13 had a concomitant lesion of the long head of the biceps; 12 were treated with biceps tenodesis. At last follow-up, there were 2 retears detected by both MRI and examinations (positive belly-press and liftoff tests). Seventeen patients were satisfied with their results at 24 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of isolated subscapularis tendon tears is an effective technique with good-to-excellent clinical and functional results. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of biologic augmentation of rotator cuff repair with iliac crest bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The prevalence of healing and prevention of re-tears were correlated with the number of MSCs received at the tendon-to-bone interface. METHODS: Forty-five patients in the study group received concentrated bone marrow-derived MSCs as an adjunct to single-row rotator cuff repair at the time of arthroscopy. The average number of MSCs returned to the patient was 51,000 +/- 25,000. Outcomes of patients receiving MSCs during their repair were compared to those of a matched control group of 45 patients who did not receive MSCs. All patients underwent imaging studies of the shoulder with iterative ultrasound performed every month from the first postoperative month to the 24th month. The rotator cuff healing or re-tear was confirmed with MRI postoperatively at three and six months, one and two years and at the most recent follow up MRI (minimum ten-year follow-up). RESULTS: Bone marrow-derived MSC injection as an adjunctive therapy during rotator cuff repair enhanced the healing rate and improved the quality of the repaired surface as determined by ultrasound and MRI. Forty-five (100 %) of the 45 repairs with MSC augmentation had healed by six months, versus 30 (67 %) of the 45 repairs without MSC treatment by six months. Bone marrow concentrate (BMC) injection also prevented further ruptures during the next ten years. At the most recent follow-up of ten years, intact rotator cuffs were found in 39 (87 %) of the 45 patients in the MSC-treated group, but just 20 (44 %) of the 45 patients in the control group. The number of transplanted MSCs was determined to be the most relevant to the outcome in the study group, since patients with a loss of tendon integrity at any time up to the ten-year follow-up milestone received fewer MSCs as compared with those who had maintained a successful repair during the same interval. CONCLUSION: This study showed that significant improvement in healing outcomes could be achieved by the use of BMC containing MSC as an adjunct therapy in standard of care rotator cuff repair. Furthermore, our study showed a substantial improvement in the level of tendon integrity present at the ten-year milestone between the MSC-treated group and the control patients. These results support the use of bone marrow-derived MSC augmentation in rotator cuff repair, especially due to the enhanced rate of healing and the reduced number of re-tears observed over time in the MSC-treated patients.

AB  - Background: Rotator cuff tears are common injuries that are reliably treated with arthroscopic repair, producing good to excellent results. The Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index is a validated disease-specific instrument used to assess patient outcomes; however, no study to date has correlated WORC index with treatment failure. Purpose: To evaluate the WORC index as a predictor for successful treatment in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. An additional purpose was to identify patient and tear characteristics associated with risk of treatment failure. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study reviewed a total of 500 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Patient charts were reviewed for treatment failures, defined as persistent or recurrent shoulder pain or weakness, leading to further workup and identification of a failure to heal or recurrent tear by magnetic resonance imaging. Patient demographic and comorbidity data were gathered and correlated with risk of failure. All patients completed WORC questionnaires, and scores were correlated with risk of treatment failure. Results: There were 28 (5.6%) treatment failures at a median 28 weeks (SD, 42 weeks) postoperatively. Patients claiming workers' compensation were 3.21 times more likely (odds ratio; P = .018) to fail treatment. Posterior interval tears (those including infraspinatus) were 3.14 times more likely (P = .01) to fail than anterior interval tears. Tear size was associated with treatment failure; the odds of failure was 3.24 for a 2-tendon tear and 5.83 for a 3-tendon tear (P = .03). Tears involving the nondominant arm were associated with an increased risk of failure by a factor of 3.04 (95% CI, 1.01-9.11; P = .047). A WORC score >=80 was associated with a 95% probability of treatment success at 1 year. Conclusion: After arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, patients with WORC scores >=80 at 1 year have a 95% probability of successful treatment and likely do not benefit from continued follow-up visits. Furthermore, several risk factors were identified that may influence outcomes after rotator cuff repair, including workers' compensation, location of tear, tear size, and hand dominance.

AB  - PURPOSE: Outcomes of open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs are well reported in the literature. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence and clinical impact of osteoarthritis 20 years following rotator cuff repair. The hypothesis was that, at long follow-up, most shoulders would have developed gleno-humeral osteoarthritis. METHODS: The authors retrospectively recalled all 322 patients, operated for rotator cuff tears in 1994 at 6 different centres, for clinical and radiographic assessment. At 20 years of follow-up, 24 were re-operated (5 arthroplasty) and 53.4% were lost to follow-up. This left 126 patients, had been clinically assessed, had Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) that allowed anatomic assessment of tendon healing (Sugaya), fatty infiltration (Goutallier), and X rays in order to analyse arthritis without head migration (Samilson) and with head migration (Hamada and Fukuda). Only patients with complete data were selected. RESULTS: Mean aged was 52.3 years (25.3-68.6) at index operation. The Constant score was 45.3+/-19.6 preoperatively to 67.4+/-18.7 points at 20 years. The SSV was 73.5+/-21 postoperatively. The rate of osteoarthritis was 29%. Osteoarthritis was associated with a significant inferior Constant score compared to the non-arthritic group (61 versus 71 points, p=0.02), mainly due to a significant lower strength (5.4 versus 8.7 points, p=0.007). Massive rotator cuff tears were significantly associated with a higher rate of osteoarthritis. Only 4,8% patients after cuff repear needed a reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Significantly less osteoarthritis was observed when the rotator cuff repair remained intact. Suprasupinatus retear had a significant influence on fatty infiltration of the infrasupinatus muscle and on the progression towards osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: Twenty years after open rotator cuff repair, the rate of osteoarthritis was 29%. Massive rotator cuff tears were significantly associated with a higher rate of osteoarthritis. Less osteoarthritis was observed when suprasupinatus healed. Level of evidence: Iv.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of arthroscopic rotator cuff surgeries is consistently increasing. Although generally considered successful, the reported number of retears after rotator cuff repair is substantial. Short-term clinical outcomes are reported to be rarely impaired by tendon retears, whereas to our knowledge, there is no study documenting long-term clinical outcomes and tendon integrity after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. PURPOSE: To investigate longitudinal long-term repair integrity and clinical outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Thirty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with suture anchors for a full-tendon full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus or a partial-tendon full-thickness tear of the infraspinatus were included. Two and 10 years after initial arthroscopic surgery, tendon integrity was analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score and Constant score as well as subjective questions regarding satisfaction with the procedure and return to normal activity were used to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: At the early MRI follow-up, 42% of patients showed a full-thickness rerupture, while 25% had a partial rerupture, and 33% of tendons remained intact. The 10-year MRI follow-up (129 +/- 11 months) showed 50% with a total rerupture, while the other half of the tendons were partially reruptured (25%) or intact (25%). The UCLA and Constant scores significantly improved from preoperatively (UCLA total: 50.6% +/- 20.2%; Constant total: 44.7 +/- 10.5 points) to 2 years (UCLA total: 91.4% +/- 16.0% [ P < .001]; Constant total: 87.8 +/- 15.3 points [ P < .001]) and remained significantly higher after 10 years (UCLA total: 89.7% +/- 15.9% [ P < .001]; Constant total: 77.5 +/- 15.6 points [ P < .001]). The Constant total score and Constant strength subscore, but not the UCLA score, were also significantly better at 10 years postoperatively in patients with intact tendons compared with patients with retorn tendons (Constant total: 89.0 +/- 7.8 points vs 75.7 +/- 14.1 points, respectively [ P = .034]; Constant strength: 18.0 +/- 4.9 points vs 9.2 +/- 5.2 points, respectively [ P = .006]). The majority of patients rated their satisfaction with the procedure as "excellent" (83.3%), and 87.5% returned to their normal daily activities. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair showed good clinical long-term results despite a high rate of retears. Nonetheless, intact tendons provided significantly superior clinical long-term outcomes, making the improvement of tendon healing and repair integrity important goals of future research efforts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate any association between preoperative smoking and perioperative and early postoperative complications in patients following shoulder and knee arthroscopic surgery. METHODS: This is a retrospective study using the prospectively collected National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database. All patients who underwent eight specific shoulder and knee arthroscopy procedures, identified by current procedural terminology codes, were included in this study and analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses to determine the impact of preoperative smoking status on postoperative complications. These procedures were knee arthroscopy with meniscectomy (medial or lateral), knee arthroscopy with meniscectomy (medial and lateral), knee arthroscopy with chondroplasty, knee arthroscopy with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, shoulder arthroscopy with subacromial decompression, shoulder arthroscopy with debridement, subacromial arthroscopy with rotator cuff repair, and shoulder arthroscopy with distal clavicle excision. Thirty-day complications including cardiac, renal, wound, pulmonary, clotting, and mortality were assessed following knee and shoulder arthroscopy. RESULTS: A total of 134,822 cases were included in the study. Multivariate analysis found that smoking was an independent risk factor for complications in shoulder arthroscopy with subacromial decompression (odd's ratio [OR] = 1.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.030-2.075), shoulder arthroscopy with debridement (OR = 1.933; 95% CI 1.211-3.084), and knee arthroscopy with medial and lateral meniscectomy (OR = 1.97; 95% CI 1.407-2.757). Smoking was not an independent risk factor for complications in the other five procedures studied. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative smoking was found to be an independent risk factor for complications for several arthroscopic procedures, though with variability between specific procedures.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY A rotator cuff tear is a relatively frequent cause of pain and restricted motion of the shoulder. Some orthopaedists believe that any attempt at rotator cuff reconstruction will fail. The aim of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopic reconstruction of rotator cuff tears. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 1998 and December 2008, 319 patients with an early diagnosis of rotator cuff rupture were treated. The group included 67 women and 252 men, with an average age of 37 years (range, 24 to 71 years) at the time of surgery. The patients indicated for arthroscopic reconstruction had to show free motion of the shoulder, had a full thickness tear up to 3 cm in size in the sagittal plane and a Patte stage 2 tear in the frontal plane at the maximum. The outcome of surgery was evaluated at one year of follow-up and included the patient's self-assessment, modified UCLA score and incidence of complications. The probability of failure was calculated as an odds ratio of an implant failure to failure of the other implants and the probability of repeat surgery in a given implant was calculated as a relative risk in relation to the other implants. RESULTS The average operative time was 52 minutes (range, 25 to 85); the average UCLA score increased frornlO to 31 points (p<0.00001). An excellent or a good result was achieved in 80% of the patients. Rotator cuff reconstruction failed in 32 patients (11%), of whom 22 (7.6%) underwent revision surgery. The failure was due to migration of rotator cuff anchors or thread failure in 14 patients (14/32; 44%). The Gil anchors showed the highest risk of failure, with the odds ratio of 5.55 (95 % Cl, 2.22 to 13.84) for mechanical failure of the method and a relative risk of revision surgery of 7.62 (95% Cl, 2.86 to 20.27). For comparison, the RC anchors had the odds ratio for mechanical failure equal to 0.55 (95 % Cl, 0.25 to 1.24) and the relative risk of repeat surgery equal to 0.41 (95% Cl, 0.12 to 1.43). In addition, 18 complications were recorded. The frequency of deep wound infection was 0.7% (2/319). Six patients (2.1%) required repeat surgery for symptomatic bursitis and adhesive capsulitis. DISCUSSION A recent meta-analysis has found no significant difference between the results of surgical rotator cuff reconstruction and its conservative treatment. We do not support this view but present here evidence that, when certain conditions are fulfilled, arthroscopic reconstruction can produce a very good clinical outcome. CONSLUSIONS The arthroscopic reconstruction of a rotator cuff tears results in a marked relief of pain and improved joint function. An ideal candidate for this treatment should show passive free motion at the shoulder joint, no clinical signs of bursitis, and mobilisable tendon stumps of the torn rotator cuff. In addition, these patients should be highly motivated for post-operative rehabilitation. A suture device was most effective in rotator cuff repair. For good fixation into the bone it is recommended to use special implants that have a minimal risk of dislodgement or anchor thread failure.

AB  - PURPOSE: To show descriptive clinical and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging results after an additional periosteal flap augmentation in mini-open rotator cuff reconstruction and to evaluate potential healing improvement at long-term follow-up. METHODS: Twenty-three patients with degenerative rotator cuff tears were followed after receiving a mini-open single-row repair with a subtendinous periosteal flap augmentation. Data were collected preoperatively, after 12 months and after 11 years. Clinical examination, simple shoulder test (SST), Constant-Murley Score (CS), ultrasonography examination and 3T MR imaging were performed. RESULTS: Out of 23 patients, 20 were available for short-term and 19 for final follow-up at a median of 11.5 years (range 10.4-13.0). Questions answered with "yes" in SST improved from baseline 5.0 (range 1.0-8.0) to short 10.5 (range 8.0-12.0) and final follow-up 12.0 (range 7.0-12.0). CS improved from 53.5 (range 25.0-66.0) to 80.8 (range 75.9-89.3) and finally to 79.8 points (range 42.3-95.4). Improvement was highly significant (p < 0.05). Severe retears were found in 9/19 patients. Ossifications along the refixed tendon were noticed in 8/19 cases. Ossifications did not correlate with clinical outcome. At final follow-up, patients with retears seemed likely to have lower strength values in CS (mean +/- SD) than patients without retears (7.3 +/- 4.1 vs. 12.8 +/- 5.3; p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: No positive effect on improving healing response in rotator cuff refixation with a periosteal flap augmentation could be found. Retear rate is comparable to that of conventional rotator cuff refixation in the published literature. Ossifications along the tendon, without negatively affecting the clinical outcome, were seen. This invasive technique cannot be advised and should not be used anymore. Level of evidence: Iv.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare arthroscopic suture bridge (SB) techniques with medial tying to those without tying, considering clinical and structural outcomes. METHODS: We included 124 patients with rotator cuff tears after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Fifty-three patients with clinical and structural evaluations 3, 12, and 24 months postoperatively were included and divided into 29 patients with medial tying (WMT group) and 24 without tying (WOMT group). Clinical outcomes comprised the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores. Structural outcomes were evaluated with magnetic resonance images (MRI) using Sugaya classifications. RESULTS: JOA and UCLA scores in the WMT and WOMT groups improved significantly from before surgery to 24 months after surgery (P < 0.01, respectively). No significant difference was noted between groups. No significant postoperative retears (Sugaya types 4 and 5) between WMT and WOMT groups were noted at 3 months (5 vs 3 cases), 12 months (6 vs 5 cases), and 24 months (7 vs 6 cases) postoperatively. Complete healing (Sugaya type 1) was noted at 3 months (8 vs 11 cases), 12 months (10 vs 10 cases), and 24 months (8 vs 13 cases, P = 0.024) postoperatively. Incomplete healing (Sugaya types 2 and 3) were noted at 3 months (16 vs 10 cases), 12 months (13 vs 9 cases), and 24 months (14 vs 5 cases, P = 0.024) postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes for both techniques were comparable, but the number of incompletely healed tendons in SB with medial tying was significantly larger at 24 months after surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: This study is a level III, case-control study. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study revealed the influence of medial tying in rotator cuff repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has recently been popularized for treating tears. In a biomechanical trial, the Mason-Allen stitch improved the fixation quality of poorly vascularized tendons. The use of this technique involving the subscapularis tendon remains rare. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of Mason-Allen technique repaired subscapularis tendons. METHODS: A retrospective research of collected data from 98 patients with subscapularis tears who had undergone arthroscopic repair between May 2015 and December 2018. There were 75 males and 23 females. The mean age was 56.4 +/- 9.6 years and the mean follow-up was 12.5 +/- 4.0 months. The visual analog scale (VAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and Constant-Murley score were used to analyze shoulder function. An MRI was performed to assess the integrity of the repair. RESULTS: Patients had significantly less pain and a better active range of motion compared with preoperative levels. VAS improved significantly from a preoperative mean of 3.42 to a postoperative mean of 1.91. ASES increased significantly from the preoperative mean of 43.6 to the postoperative mean of 74.5. Seven cases suffered from retears, which were confirmed by an MRI examination. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with the Mason-Allen method resulted in a decreased level of pain and satisfied function recovery.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of clinically significant postoperative stiffness following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. This study also sought to determine the clinical and surgical factors that were associated with higher rates of postoperative stiffness. Finally, we analyzed the result of arthroscopic lysis of adhesions and capsular release for treatment of patients who developed refractory postoperative stiffness 4 to 19 months (median, 8 months) following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: A retrospective review of a consecutive series of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs was conducted. During a 3-year time period, the senior author (S.S.B.) performed 489 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. The operative indications, technique of the rotator cuff repair, and the rehabilitation protocol were essentially unchanged during this time period. Demographic data, comorbid medical conditions, rotator cuff tear description, technique of repair, and concomitant surgical procedures were evaluated for their effect on stiffness. All office evaluations were reviewed to determine the pre- and postoperative motion, pain scores, functional strength, and patient satisfaction. Patients who were dissatisfied because of the development of postoperative stiffness underwent secondary arthroscopic lysis of adhesions. The final result of the secondary lysis of adhesions and capsular release were analyzed. RESULTS: In total, 24 patients (4.9%) were dissatisfied with the result of their procedure because of the development of postoperative stiffness, which was more likely (P < .05) to develop in patients with Workers' Compensation insurance (8.6%), patients younger than 50 years of age (8.6%), those with a coexisting diagnosis of calcific tendonitis (16.7%) or adhesive capsulitis (15.0%) requiring additional postoperative therapy, partial articular-sided tendon avulsion (PASTA) type rotator cuff tear (13.5%), or concomitant labral repair (11.0%). Patients with concomitant coracoplasty (2.3%) or tears larger in size and/or involving more tendons were less likely (P < .05) to develop postoperative stiffness. Among 90 patients positive for selected risk factors (adhesive capsulitis, excision of calcific deposits, single-tendon repair, PASTA repair, or any labral repair without a concomitant coracoplasty), 12 (13.3%) developed postoperative stiffness (P < .001). This overall clinical risk factor combined with Workers' Compensation insurance identified 16 of the 24 cases resulting in a sensitivity of 66.7% and a specificity of 64.5%. All 24 patients who experienced postoperative stiffness elected to undergo arthroscopic lysis of adhesions and capsular release, which was performed from 4 to 19 months (median, 8 months) after the rotator cuff repair. During second-look arthroscopy, 23 patients (95.8%) were noted to have complete healing of the original pathology. Following capsular release, all 24 patients were satisfied with the overall result of their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In a series of 489 consecutive arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, we found that 24 patients (4.9%) developed postoperative stiffness. Risk factors for postoperative stiffness were calcific tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis, single-tendon cuff repair, PASTA repair, being under 50 years of age, and having Workers' Compensation insurance. Twenty-three of 24 patients (95.8%) showed complete healing of the rotator cuff. Arthroscopic release resulted in normal motion in all cases. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of the arthroscopic knotless-anchor Speed-Bridge technique, in particular the pattern and the rate of retears. The results were compared with a modified Suture-Bridge knot-tying technique (mDR). The hypothesis is that arthroscopic knotless-anchor Speed-Bridge rotator cuff repair is a sufficient technique to address supraspinatus tears and differs in pattern of retears when compared to mDR. METHODS: This study includes twenty-two consecutive patients (8f/14m o 63.3 +/- 7.2 years) undergoing knotless-anchor Speed-Bridge repair. The subjective shoulder value (SSV), Constant score (CS) and Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) Score were used for clinical follow-up. MRI scans were conducted within 3 weeks post-operatively, after 1 and after 2 years for analysis of (a) tendon integrity (according to Sugaya), (b) muscle atrophy according to Thomazeau and (c) fatty infiltration. Results were compared with 20 patients operated in mDR (o 61.2 +/- 7.5 years). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 24.4 +/- 4.7 months. The average SSV was 88.7 +/- 14.9 %, the CS was 78.2 +/- 13.2 points (contralateral side 78.5 +/- 16.6) and the WORC Score averaged 87.1 +/- 18.2 %. On magnetic resonance imaging, the integrity failure rate was 22.7 % (n = 5). The pattern of retear was a medial cuff failure in 2/5 cases (mDR 4/5, n.s.). Muscular atrophy or fatty degeneration did not increase between surgery and follow-up (n.s.). Compared with mDR (25 %) reconstruction, no significant differences were obtained regarding integrity failure rate and muscular atrophy (n.s.). CONCLUSION: The modified knotless-anchor Speed-Bridge technique shows good to excellent clinical results as well as acceptable retear rates. This technique eliminates medial and lateral knot impingement. Concerning the potential reduction in the medial strangulation of the tendon, there is a need for further clinical research.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of rotator cuff repair continues to rise, with a noted transition from open to arthroscopic techniques in recent years. One reported advantage of arthroscopic repair is a lower infection rate. However, to date, the infection rates of these 2 techniques have not been directly compared with large samples at a single institution with fully integrated medical records. Purpose(s): To retrospectively compare postoperative infection rates between arthroscopic and open rotator cuff repair. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Method(s): From January 2003 until May 2011, a total of 1556 patients underwent rotator cuff repair at a single institution. These patients were divided into an arthroscopic repair group and an open group. A Pearson chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used, with a subgroup analysis to segment the open repair group into mini-open and open procedures. The odds ratio and 95% CI of developing a postoperative infection was calculated for the 2 groups. A multiple-regressions model was then utilized to identify predictors of the presence of infection. Infection was defined as only those treated with surgical intervention, thus excluding superficial infections treated with antibiotics alone. Result(s): A total of 903 patients had an arthroscopic repair, while 653 had open repairs (600 mini-open, 53 open). There were 4 confirmed infections in the arthroscopic group and 16 in the open group (15 mini-open, 1 open), resulting in postoperative infection rates of 0.44% and 2.45%, respectively. Subgroup analysis of the mini-open and open groups demonstrated a postoperative infection rate of 2.50% and 1.89%, respectively. The open group had an odds ratio of 5.645 (95% CI, 1.9-17.0) to develop a postoperative infection compared with the arthroscopic group. Conclusion(s): Patients undergoing open rotator cuff repair had a significantly higher rate of postoperative infection compared with those undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - PURPOSE: High-grade partial thickness rotator cuff tears (i.e., those involving at least 50% of the tendon thickness) are especially challenging to treat and various treatment strategies have been described. Prior studies have demonstrated equivalent outcomes between in situ tear fixation and tear completion repair techniques. However, it is unknown how repair of completed high-grade partial thickness tears to full tears compares to repair of full-thickness tears. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcome measures at least 1 year postoperatively between patients who had completion of a high-grade partial thickness supraspinatus tear to a full-thickness tear (PT) and those who had an isolated full-thickness supraspinatus tear (FT). The hypothesis of this study was equivalent retear rates as well as equivalent clinical and patient-reported outcomes between the two groups. METHODS: A retrospective review of 100 patients who underwent isolated arthroscopic supraspinatus repair between 2013 and 2018 with a minimum of 1 year follow-up was performed. Patients were separated into two groups based on their treatment: 56 had completion of a partial thickness supraspinatus tear to full-thickness tear with repair (PT) and 44 had isolated full-thickness supraspinatus repairs (FT). The primary outcome was rotator cuff retear, which was defined as a supraspinatus retear requiring revision repair. Secondary outcomes were patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) including visual analog pain scale (VAS) and subjective shoulder value (SSV), range of motion (ROM) and strength in forward flexion (FF), external rotation (ER), and internal rotation (IR). RESULTS: There was a significantly lower rate of retear between the PT versus FT groups (3.6% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.040). There were no significant differences between groups for all PROs, all ROM parameters, and all strength parameters (all n.s.). DISCUSSION: The data from this study demonstrated that the PT group had a significantly lower retear rate at 1 year follow-up than the FT group, while PROs, ROM, and strength were similar between the two groups. Patients with PT supraspinatus tears can have excellent outcomes, equivalent to FT tears, after completion of the tear, and subsequent repair with low retear rates. These findings may aid the treating surgeon when choosing between in situ fixation of the PT supraspinatus tear or completion of the tear and subsequent repair, as it allows the treating surgeon to choose the procedure based on comfort and experience level. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Failure of tendon healing after a rotator cuff repair is demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a fluid-filled defect within the tendon. The frequency of, and factors associated with, failure of the tendon repair to heal have been the focus of many clinical studies. The timing of when these defects occur has not been previously studied in a large prospectively defined patient population, to our knowledge. It was our hypothesis that the majority of failures occur within twelve weeks after surgery. METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients were enrolled in a multi-institutional prospective study. All patients had a standardized arthroscopic repair of a full-thickness tear of 1 to 4 cm as well as sequential MRI studies at six intervals from two weeks to fifty-two weeks. MRIs were reviewed at the time of imaging by the treating surgeon. Standardized patient-oriented clinical data were collected, physical examination was performed, and strength measurements were made preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: The treating surgeons diagnosed a recurrent tear with MRI in nineteen (17%) of the 113 patients within one year after surgery. The mean time to the retear was 19.2 weeks. There was a linear increase in retears over the first twenty-six weeks after surgery, and one additional tear was diagnosed between twenty-six and fifty-two weeks after repair. CONCLUSIONS: Retears primarily occur between six and twenty-six weeks after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and few additional tears occur thereafter. A substantial number of retears occur between twelve and twenty-six weeks after repair. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - While previous studies have revealed factors affecting the progression of rotator cuff tear (RCT), none have yet described factors affecting its onset. The purpose of this longitudinal observational study was to analyze factors affecting the RCT onset and progression in the general population. The present study included 185 shoulders from 93 participants who completed all the examinations in both 2012 and 2017. Participants received a questionnaire with age, gender, arm dominance, and presence of pain at rest, in motion, and at night. The range of motion (ROM), simple shoulder test (SST) were also examined. Anteroposterior radiograph of the shoulder joint was performed to evaluate the degree of osteoarthritic changes by the Samilson-Prieto (S-P) classification. The degree of RCT was examined by ultrasonography. There were 132 shoulders without RCT and 53 with RCT in 2012. RCT occurred in 21 of 132 shoulders, and the factor affecting the RCT onset was S-P grade 2 osteoarthritic change in 2012 (odds ratio [OR] 10.10). RCT progressed in 22 of 53 shoulders, and the factor affecting RCT progression was the presence of motion pain in 2012 (OR 13.76). These results added new knowledge regarding the natural course of RCT onset and progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared the outcomes of knotless double-row suture bridge and single-row repairs in patients undergoing arthroscopic repair for anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. METHODS: We included 61 full-thickness anterosuperior rotator cuff tears treated by arthroscopic repair, namely, single-row repair (group 1: 25 shoulders; mean patient age, 64 years) and the knotless double-row suture bridge repair (group 2: 36 shoulders; mean patient age, 62 years). Preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was performed for all shoulders. Clinical outcomes were evaluated for mean follow-up periods of 81 months (range, 72-96 months) in group 1 and 34 months (range, 24-42 months) in group 2, using the University of California, Los Angeles and Japanese Orthopaedic Association assessments. RESULTS: At the final follow-up, both groups showed improvement in the average University of California, Los Angeles and Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores and range of motion, although no intergroup differences were observed. Both groups showed improved abduction strength, and the average score was higher in group 2 (P = .0112). The lift-off and belly-press test results were improved in both groups. Postoperatively, the incidence of positive lift-off tests tended to be lower (P = .075) and that of positive belly-press tests was lower in group 2, P = .049). The repair failure rate tended to be lower in group 2 (14% [5 of 36]) than in group 1 (32% [8 of 25]; P = .0839). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic knotless double-row suture bridge repair of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears yielded functional outcomes equivalent to those of single-row repair and may be useful for improving subscapularis function, abduction strength, and tendon healing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and functional outcomes from arthroscopic repairs on small and medium-sized tears of the supraspinatus muscle tendon. METHODS: 129 cases of isolated small and medium tears of the supraspinatus muscle tendon were evaluated retrospectively. The average duration of pain was 29 months. The average joint range of motion comprised active elevation of 136degree, lateral rotation of 58degree and medial rotation at T12 level; and the preoperative functional UCLA score averaged 17 points. In all the cases, complete repair could be achieved. RESULTS: The average score on the UCLA functional scale in the postoperative period was 32 points. The average length of follow-up was 39 months. Seventy-five cases (58%) had excellent results and 42 (32%) had good results. The average final active elevation was 156degree with an average gain of 20degree, and the average final lateral rotation was 57degree with an average gain of 9degree. Both of these were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The patients who underwent tenotomy of the long head of the biceps (LHB), with or without tenodesis, did not present statistically inferior functional outcomes, in comparison with the patients who only underwent decompression and lesion repair (P = 1.00). Fourteen cases (10.8%) presented complications during the postoperative period. Six (4.6%) developed adhesive capsulitis and four (3.1%) presented re-rupture of the tendon, proven by means of magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of small and medium tears of the supraspinatus muscle tendon provided a functional clinical improvement, with good and excellent results in 90% of the cases.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the functional result of arthroscopic treatment in anterosuperior rotator cuff tears. Methods: Fifty-six patients submitted to arthroscopic repair of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears were evaluated. The follow-up time was five year and five months. All the tears were diagnosed by detailed physical and imaging examination. Statistical analysis was used to compare the preoperative and postoperative results of range of motion and the UCLA score, with Wilcoxon signed-rank test, 5% significance level (p<=0.05), the relationship between the subscapularis tear and postoperative results using the Mann-Whitney test, and between the pain length and the UCLA scale using Spearman's correlation. Results: A statistically significant improvement (p<0.001) was found, comparing the range of motion and the UCLA preoperatively and postoperatively. 39% of the cases were classified as excellent, 33.9% as good, 23.7% as regular and 3.4% as bad results. A statistically significant relationship was found between the subscapularis tear type and the functional state, the pain length and the postoperative UCLA scale. Five complications, four reruptures and one adhesive capsulitis were found. Conclusions: The arthroscopic treatment for anterosuperior tears presented satisfactory results, with 8.5% of complications. <b>Level of Evidence IV, Case series.</b>

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)-related hand lesions are one of the complications following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with CRPS-related hand lesions following ARCR. METHODS: Altogether, 103 patients with ARCR were included in this study (mean age, 63.6+/-8.2 years; 66 males and 37 females; follow-up period, preoperative to 12 months postoperative). Clinical assessment included the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score, Constant score, 36-item short form health survey (SF-36) score, and Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) score from preoperative to 12 months postoperatively. The patients were either assigned to the CRPS group or non-CRPS group depending on CRPS diagnosis until the final follow-up, and clinical outcomes were then compared between the groups. RESULTS: Of 103 patients, 20 (19.4%) had CRPS-related hand lesions that developed entirely within 2 months postoperatively. Both groups showed significant improvement in JOA, UCLA, and Constant scores preoperatively to 12 months postoperatively (P<0.001). Comparisons between the two groups were not significantly different, except for SF-36 "general health perception" (P<0.05) at 12 months postoperatively. At final follow-up, three patients had residual CRPS-related hand lesions with limited range of motion and finger edema. CONCLUSIONS: CRPS-related hand lesions developed in 19.4% of patients following ARCR. Shoulder or upper-limb function improved in most cases at 12 months, with satisfactory SF-36 patient-based evaluation results. Patients with residual CRPS-related hand lesions at the last follow-up require long-term follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The transosseous-equivalent cross bridge double row (TESBDR) rotator cuff (RC) repair technique has been developed to optimize healing biology at a repaired RC tendon insertion. It has been shown in the laboratory to improve pressurized contact area and mean foot print pressure when compared with a double row anchor technique. Pressure has been shown to influence healing between tendon and bone, and the tendon compression vector provided by the transosseous-equivalent suture bridges may enhance healing. The purpose was to prospectively evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopic TESBDR RC repair. METHODS: Single center prospective case series study. Sixty-nine patients were selected to undergo arthroscopic TESBDR RC repair and were included in the current study. Primary outcome measures included the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score, the Constant-Murley (CM) Score and Range of motion (ROM). Secondary outcome measures included a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, another VAS for patient satisfaction from the operative procedure, EuroQoL 5-Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) for quality of life assessment. RESULTS: At 24 months post-operative, average OSS score was 44, average UCLA score was 31, average CM score was 88, average forward flexion was 145degree, average internal rotation was 35degree, average external rotation was 79degree, average abduction was 150degree, average EQ-5D score was 0.73, average VAS for pain was 2.3, and average VAS for patient satisfaction was 9.2. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic TESBDR RC repair is a procedure with good post-operative functional outcome and low re-tear rate based on a short term follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff musculature increases in larger tears and is a factor in retearing. However, tearing may recur even in patients with small original tears and little fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff musculature. We devised a system to classify the rotator cuff tendon stump by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensity and investigated prognosis-related factors associated with retear based on other MRI findings. METHODS: We analyzed and compared the signal intensity of the rotator cuff tendon stump and deltoid on preoperative T2-weighted fat-suppressed MRI in 305 patients who underwent primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. We also investigated the tear size, Goutallier stage, and global fatty degeneration index. RESULTS: In a type 1 stump, the tendon stump had a lower (darker) signal intensity than the deltoid. In type 2, the signal intensities of the tendon stump and deltoid were equivalent. In type 3, the signal intensity of the tendon stump was higher (whiter) than that of the deltoid. Multiple regression analysis of the association between retear and other parameters identified stump type (odds ratio [OR], 4.28), global fatty degeneration index (OR, 2.99), and anteroposterior tear size (OR, 1.06) as significant factors. The retear rates were 3.4% for type 1 stumps, 4.9% for type 2, and 17.7% for type 3. CONCLUSIONS: Type 3 stumps had a significantly higher retear rate, suggesting that stump signal intensity may be an important indicator for assessing the stump's condition. Our stump classification may be useful in choosing suture techniques and postoperative therapies.

AB  - Re-tearing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) frequently occurs, and high stiffness of the rotator cuff may be one of the factors. We investigated changes in stiffness of the supraspinatus muscle and tendon after ARCR as measured by shear wave elastography (SWE) with B-mode ultrasound, and compared the supraspinatus muscle stiffness of patients with recurrent tears and patients with healed rotator cuffs. Sixty patients with supraspinatus tears requiring ARCR underwent serial SWE of their supraspinatus muscles and repaired tendons. SWE was performed before surgery (Pre-Op) and at 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, and 6 months after surgery. Additionally, the repaired rotator cuffs were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months after surgery to classify patients into a healed rotator cuff group and a recurrent tear group. Differences in SWE values between the groups were assessed at each time point. The SWE value of the repaired tendon at 1 week after ARCR was significantly greater than at 3 and 6 months. The SWE value for the supraspinatus muscle at 1 month after ARCR surgery in the healed group was lower than at Pre-Op and 4, 5, and 6 months after surgery, and it was also lower than that at 1 month after surgery in the re-tear group. There were no significant differences between time points in the SWE values of the supraspinatus muscle in the re-tear group. The SWE value of the muscle in the re-tear group was greater than in the healed group at 1 month after surgery (p < 0.05). Increased SWE values at 1 month after ARCR may predict recurrent rotator cuff tears after surgery rather than evaluating the tendon. © 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrent tears after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) remain a significant clinical problem. Oxidative stress contributes to the degeneration of the rotator cuff, and a degenerative rotator cuff can lead to recurrent tear after ARCR. However, the correlation between oxidative stress and retear after ARCR is unclear. PURPOSE: To investigate the correlation between superoxide-induced oxidative stress and recurrent tear after ARCR. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 68 patients who underwent ARCR using a suture-bridge technique participated in this study. Specimens were collected from the edge of the torn tendon during surgery. The modified Bonar score was used to evaluate degeneration of the rotator cuff on histological specimens, and fluorescence intensity on dihydroethidium (DHE) staining was used to detect oxidative stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity was also measured. The following were used for clinical evaluation: age, tear size on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery, Goutallier classification on MRI before surgery, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association score before and 6 months after surgery. After the repaired rotator cuffs were evaluated on MRI 6 months after surgery, the patients were divided into groups: those with a healed rotator cuff (healed group; n = 46) and those with a recurrent tear (retear group; n = 22). The significant differences between the groups were determined with regard to clinical evaluation, modified Bonar score, DHE intensity, and SOD activity. In addition, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for recurrent tear. RESULTS: Age, tear size, Goutallier classification, modified Bonar score, DHE intensity, and SOD activity were significantly greater in the retear group than in the healed group, although the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score was not significantly different. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, tear size, and SOD activity were significantly correlated with recurrent tear. CONCLUSION: In addition to tear size and age, superoxide-induced oxidative stress may be an exacerbating factor for retear after ARCR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medicare insures the largest population of patients at risk for rotator cuff tears in the United States. PURPOSE: To evaluate the trends in incidence, concomitant procedures, and complications with open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in Medicare patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: All Medicare patients who had undergone open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair from 2005 through 2011 were identified with a claims database. Annual incidence, concomitant procedures, and postoperative complications were compared between these 2 groups. RESULTS: In total, 372,109 rotator cuff repairs were analyzed. The incidence of open repairs decreased (from 6.0 to 4.3 per 10,000 patients, P < .001) while the incidence of arthroscopic repairs increased (from 4.5 to 7.8 per 10,000 patients, P < .001) during the study period. Patients in the arthroscopic group were more likely to have undergone concomitant subacromial decompression than those in the open group (87% vs 35%, P < .001), and the annual incidence of concomitant biceps tenodesis increased for both groups (from 3.8% to 11% for open and 2.2% to 16% for arthroscopic, P < .001). While postoperative complications were infrequent, patients in the open group were more likely to be diagnosed with infection within 6 months (0.86% vs 0.37%, P < .001) but no more likely to undergo operative debridement (0.43% vs 0.26%, P = .08). Additionally, patients in the open group were more likely to undergo intervention for shoulder stiffness within 1 year (1.4% vs 1.1%, P = .01). CONCLUSION: In the Medicare population, arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs have increased in incidence and now represent the majority of rotator cuff repair surgery. Among concomitant procedures, subacromial decompression was most commonly performed despite evidence suggesting a lack of efficacy. Infections and stiffness were rare complications that were slightly but significantly more frequent in open rotator cuff repairs.

AB  - PURPOSE: The primary goal of this retrospective review of a prospective database was to document the functional results after acute postoperative deep infection following rotator cuff repair in a single orthopaedic unit over a period of 5 years. Secondary goals were to document the effect of infection on healing of the cuff repair and to describe its incidence, diagnostic challenges, pathogens and management. METHODS: Patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were prospectively registered from 2010 to 2014. Eleven out of 1072 repairs developed an acute postoperative infection. The patients were examined with an MRI scan, Constant-Murley (CM) score and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) at final follow-up (median of 22 months). RESULTS: All 11 patients who developed acute postoperative deep infections were males. Median age was 56 years (range 41-68). All patients underwent arthroscopic debridement and biopsies were collected at a median of 26 days (range 14-50) after primary surgery. In ten patients, Propionibacterium acnes was cultured, six of these patients also had positive cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococci. In the remaining patient, only coagulase-negative staphylococcus was cultured. Five patients were treated with one arthroscopic debridement, five had two arthroscopic debridements and one required arthroscopic debridement four times before the infection was eradicated. Two patients had their implants removed due to loosening of the suture anchors. All patients were treated with parenteral antibiotics for 1-4 weeks, followed by oral treatment for 1-5 weeks. At median 22 months (range 11-28) follow-up the median CM score was 84 and median WORC index was 81%. Ten patients had a postoperative MRI scan after a median of 23 months (range 3-49), with eight presenting a healed cuff repair. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study support the rapid, targeted intervention of acute postoperative infection after RC repair with immediate arthroscopic debridement, irrigation and biopsies for bacteriological diagnostics followed by parenteral antibiotics. Furthermore, repeated arthroscopic debridement and irrigation are recommended if signs of infection persist. Removal of the implant is rarely needed. Despite the postoperative acute infection, these patients presented good functional results at final follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been numerous reports of clinical outcomes associated with tendon healing after repair that suggest a nonhealed tendon has a negative effect on postoperative clinical outcomes. However, to our knowledge, there has been no report on the relationship between tear size progression of nonhealed tendons and clinical outcomes. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Do patients with healed arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs have better outcomes, less pain, and more strength than patients whose repair did not heal? (2) In patients with nonhealed rotator cuff tendons, does tear size progression (increase or decrease) affect outcomes, pain, and strength? (3) Is there continued improvement beyond 6 months in outcomes, pain, and strength; and how do the improvements differ based on whether the tear size has increased or decreased? METHODS: Between May 2008 and December 2012, 647 patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for full-thickness tears at our institution. Of those, 442 patients (68%) had all MRI and clinical information available to permit inclusion in this retrospective study at a minimum of 2 years followup (mean, 33 +/- 4 months; range, 24-43 months). Healing of the repaired tendon and tear size progression were assessed using MRI at 6 months postoperatively. Eighty-two of 442 tears (19%) were not healed. Of the nonhealed tears, 45 (55%) had a decrease and 37 (45%) had an increase in tear size. Shoulder function outcomes using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) and Constant scores and pain severity using VAS scores were evaluated preoperatively, at 6 months postoperatively, and at the latest followup. Isometric muscle strength was measured at 6 months postoperatively and at the latest followup. RESULTS: Compared with patients with nonhealed tendons after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, patients with healed repairs had improved ASES scores (healed, 93 +/- 5; nonhealed, 89 +/- 8; mean difference, 4; 95% CI, 3-5; p < 0.001), better Constant scores (healed, 91 +/- 5; nonhealed, 85 +/- 8; mean difference, 6; 95% CI, 4-7; p < 0.001), and greater strength ([flexion: healed, 96% +/- 7%; nonhealed, 85% +/- 12%; mean difference, 11%; 95% CI, 9%-13%; p < 0.001]; [external rotation: healed, 92% +/- 8%; nonhealed, 80% +/- 12%; mean difference, 11%; 95% CI, 9%-14%; p < 0.001]; [internal rotation: healed, 97% +/- 8%; nonhealed, 92% +/- 8%; mean difference, 5%; 95% CI, 3%-7%; p < 0.001]); however there was no difference in pain level based on VAS scores (healed, 0.9 +/- 0.8; nonhealed, 1.0 +/- 0.8; mean difference, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.0-0.4; p = 0.226). Compared with patients with increased tear size, patients with decreased tear size had better ASES scores (decreased, 91 +/- 6; increased, 8 6 +/- 8; p = 0.001), improved Constant scores (decreased, 88 +/- 6; increased, 82 +/- 9; p = 0.003), greater flexion strength (decreased, 91% +/- 9%; increased, 78% +/- 11%; p < 0.001), and greater external rotation strength (decreased, 86% +/- 10%; increased, 73% +/- 11%; p < 0.001). However, the difference does not seem to meet a minimal clinically important difference. Patients with increased tear size differed from those with decreased tear size with respect to flexion and external rotation strength where the former had no improvement. There was no improvement in flexion (6 months, 78% +/- 11%; latest followup, 78% +/- 11%; p = 0.806) and external rotation strength (6 months, 74% +/- 12%; latest followup, 73% +/- 11%; p = 0.149). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had healed tendons after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair had better shoulder function than patients who had nonhealed tendons. Among patients with nonhealed rotator cuff tendons after surgery, those with decreased tear size, observed on their 6-month postoperative MRI, compared with their initial tear size, showed better shoulder function and muscle strength than those with increased tear size beyond 6 months. Although results are statistically different, they seem insufficient to achieve clinically important differences. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The repair of anterior L-shaped tears is usually difficult because of the lack of anterior rotator cuff tendon to cover the footprint. The biceps tendon is usually exposed from the retracted anterolateral corner of the torn tendon and can be easily used to augment rotator cuff repair. Hypothesis/Purpose: This study compared the clinical outcomes of the biceps augmentation technique with those of partial tendon repair for the arthroscopic treatment of large anterior L-shaped rotator cuff tears to evaluate the role of additional biceps augmentation in tendon healing. We hypothesized that the biceps augmentation technique would lead to a lower rotator cuff tendon retear rate and provide satisfactory functional outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: This study included 64 patients with anterior L-shaped rotator cuff tears who underwent arthroscopic repair. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group A (31 patients) underwent repair of an anterior L-shaped tear combined with biceps augmentation, and group B (33 patients) had a partially repaired tendon whose footprint was exposed after repair without undue tension on the retracted tendon. Clinical evaluations were performed using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, muscle strength, visual analog scale for pain, and patient satisfaction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for tendon integrity at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean period of follow-up was 29.1 +/- 3.5 months (range, 24-40 months). The mean ASES and Constant scores significantly improved from 52.8 +/- 10.6 and 43.2 +/- 9.9 preoperatively to 88.2 +/- 6.9 and 86.8 +/- 6.2 at final follow-up in group A ( P < .001) and from 53.0 +/- 11.8 and 44.3 +/- 11.3 preoperatively to 87.4 +/- 7.2 and 87.9 +/- 7.3 at final follow-up in group B ( P < .001). Overall muscle strength (given as % of the other side's strength) significantly increased from preoperatively to final follow-up in group A (forward flexion [FF]: 62.0 +/- 8.2 to 89.0 +/- 8.6; external rotation [ER]: 57.5 +/- 9.9 to 86.8 +/- 9.3; internal rotation [IR]: 68.1 +/- 10.8 to 88.1 +/- 8.4; P < .001) and group B (FF: 59.9 +/- 9.6 to 87.7 +/- 9.0; ER: 58.6 +/- 9.3 to 86.2 +/- 7.5; IR: 70.0 +/- 9.3 to 87.0 +/- 8.4; P < .001). Twenty-one patients (67.7%) in group A and 20 patients (60.6%) in group B showed a healed rotator cuff tendon on postoperative MRI. The retear rate between the 2 groups showed no significant difference ( P = .552). Regarding clinical outcomes, both groups had no significant difference in the ASES score ( P = .901), Constant score ( P = .742), and muscle strength. CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in the clinical outcomes and retear rate of anterior L-shaped tears between biceps augmentation and partial tendon repair. Additional biceps augmentation proved to have no enhancement in tendon healing. A precise method such as only partial tendon repair for reducing the footprint exposure without undue tension may be considered as one of the treatment options for large anterior L-shaped rotator cuff tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to define preoperative and intraoperative findings of acute-on-chronic rotator cuff tears (RCTs). This study also compared the functional and clinical outcomes with acute-on-chronic RCTs and chronic RCTs. METHODS: This study was conducted between December 2007 and December 2013. An acute-on-chronic full-thickness RCT was diagnosed with preoperative and intraoperative findings on arthroscopy. The study group consisted of 36 patients with preoperative and intraoperative findings (surgery performed within 6 months of trauma) indicative of an acute-on-chronic RCT. Another 36 patients matched for age, sex, and tear size, who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair after 6 months of onset of symptoms (chronic RCT group), were selected from our institution's database within the same time frame. Postoperative indirect magnetic resonance arthrogram was obtained 6 months after the repair, and rotator cuff integrity was graded according to the guidelines as described by Sugaya. Patients were evaluated using the visual analog scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Assessment score, and Constant scores. Scores and measurements were obtained preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. RESULTS: The clinical outcomes and range of motion recovery were better in the acute-on-chronic RCT group. Although statistically not significant, the acute-on-chronic RCT group's repair appeared closer to the complete repair and was associated with a lesser incidence of retear than the chronic RCT group. CONCLUSION: Early repair of an acute-on-chronic full-thickness RCT results in a statistically and clinically superior improvement in outcomes compared with repairs of chronic RCTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We wished to determine the correlation between supraspinatus muscle occupation ratio and reparability of rotator cuff muscles and that of each occupation ratio with 1-muscle, 2-muscle, and 3-muscle rotator cuff injury. METHODS: We evaluated 170 patients (average age, 62.3 [40-83] years) with complete (type II) or incomplete (type III) rotator cuff repair by arthroscopy. Type II repair was defined as complete repair but less optimal coverage of the entire medial-lateral footprint. Type III repair was defined as incomplete repair; a small portion (<10 mm) of the humeral head is exposed. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 96 and 74 patients who underwent type II and type III repair, respectively. Patients were also categorized into 4 groups: isolated supraspinatus tears, supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears, supraspinatus and subscapularis tears, and tears in all 3 muscles. Supraspinatus muscle atrophy was evaluated by the occupation ratio on the most lateral T1-weighted sagittal oblique view in which the scapular spine contacted the scapular body. The supraspinatus muscle occupation ratio was measured by 2 independent observers. RESULTS: On magnetic resonance imaging, the supraspinatus muscle occupation ratio was significantly different between the completely repaired and incompletely repaired groups. The mean occupation ratio of the completely repaired group (42.39 +/- 10.1) was significantly higher than that of the incompletely repaired group (36.64 +/- 6.94). The cutoff value of the supraspinatus muscle occupation ratio (complete to incomplete repair) was 41. The supraspinatus muscle occupation ratio significantly decreased as the tear increased (P < .001). CONCLUSION: A supraspinatus muscle occupation ratio of <41 can be the cutoff value for greater tuberosity coverage vs. incomplete coverage. There was a significant correlation between tear pattern and supraspinatus muscle atrophy ratio. The supraspinatus tear group had the lowest degree of muscle atrophy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hyaluronate-based anti-adhesive agents are expected to enhance rotator cuff healing; however, their effect on the incidence and extent of postoperative complications such as stiffness and retears has not been investigated. METHODS: From July 2012 to February 2013, 80 patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery were prospectively enrolled. Forty patients were assigned to the control group, while the other 40 were assigned to the injection group and received a Guardix-sol injection immediately after surgery. Passive range of motion, pain visual analog scale, and functional score were assessed at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 24 months postoperatively. Gliding motion between the deltoid muscle and the greater tuberosity of the proximal humerus was evaluated using ultrasonography at 2 and 8 weeks postoperatively, and tendon integrity was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: We found no significant difference between the groups regarding gliding motion at 2 weeks postoperatively. However, at 8 weeks, the incidence of poor gliding motion was 2.5% and 15% for the injected patients and control group, respectively, which was statistically significant. At 6 months after surgery, the retear rate between the two groups was not statistically significant. We found no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding retear rate and clinical score throughout the follow-up period. We noted no complications related to the use of Guardix-sol. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received the Guardix-sol injection showed improved gliding motion between the deltoid muscle and the greater tuberosity in the early postoperative period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rupture of the subscapularis (SSC) tendon, isolated or combined, is rare, and the treatment modalities are controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the clinical outcomes and structural integrity of the SSC tendon after all-arthroscopic repair with single-row mattress suture for isolated or combined SSC tendon tears. METHODS: This study included 68 patients who underwent all-arthroscopic repair using single-row mattress suture for isolated or combined SSC tendon tears between April 2011 and January 2013. The patients were evaluated by the visual analog scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant shoulder score, and SSC muscle strength measurement. MRI was used for assessment of the postoperative integrity of the SSC tendon. RESULTS: With a mean follow-up of 29.5 +/- 4.0 months, the preoperative Constant shoulder and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores were 50.3 +/- 21.0 and 46.6 +/- 18.3, respectively, which improved at the last follow-up to 75.7 +/- 16.6 and 81.3 +/- 18.1, respectively, with statistical significance (P < .001). Belly-press and bear-hug test results showed some improvement in the last follow-up (>2 years) compared with the presurgical state (P = .125 and .650). A statistically significant SSC muscle strength deficit persisted in the postoperative state (P = .015). MRI evaluation showed a retear rate of 8.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of isolated or combined SSC tears with the single-row mattress suture technique results in significant clinical improvements and enduring tendon integrity, although SSC strength remains reduced from that on the normal side.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is ongoing controversy regarding the ideal repair modality for rotator cuff tear, with single-row (SR) repair and double-row transosseous equivalent (TOE) repair as the main contenders. METHODS: This study included 415 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff type I (complete coverage of the greater tuberosity footprint) or II (incomplete coverage) repair between January 2006 and December 2012. SR repair followed the conventional protocol. For double-row TOE repairs, 4 medial sutures were inserted with 2 lateral row anchors. The patients were evaluated for cuff integrity (on magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months postoperatively) and for clinical outcome (pain on the visual analog scale and various scores assessing shoulder function; all logged preoperatively and postoperatively at 3 months, 6 months, and at the last follow-up). RESULTS: SR and TOE repairs were performed in 46% and 54% of patients, respectively. Type I and type II repairs were performed in 87% and 13% of patients, respectively. The overall incidence of retear assessed on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was 6.74%. The incidence of retear in the SR group was statistically significantly higher only in large-sized tears (28.57% vs. 4.5%; P = .028). Among the postoperative scores at the final follow-up, only the function on the visual analog scale differed significantly between the groups (P < .01), with patients treated by TOE repair showing higher scores (8.47 +/- 1.70 vs. 7.91 +/- 1.66). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort study, SR and TOE repair provided similar clinical and radiologic outcomes. Nevertheless, TOE repair was associated with significantly improved healing rate for large-sized tears.

AB  - Background: A concomitant rotator cuff tear (RCT) with frozen shoulder is a common but challenging clinical scenario. The effect of frozen shoulder on clinical outcomes is open to discussion. Purpose/Hypothesis: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of preoperative frozen shoulder on postoperative clinical outcomes of an RCT. We hypothesized that the treatment results of an RCT concomitant with preoperative frozen shoulder would be comparable with those of an isolated RCT. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 212 patients were divided into 2 groups: 154 in the non-frozen shoulder (NFS) group and 58 in the preoperative frozen shoulder (FS) group. All patients underwent a thorough preoperative evaluation that included range of motion (ROM) and the pain visual analog scale, functional visual analog scale, Constant score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. The same evaluation was performed at 6 months and 1 and 2 years postoperatively. The healing status of the repaired RCT of all patients was evaluated by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The FS group showed statistically significantly worse functional outcomes than the NFS group at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively (P < .05). At 2 years postoperatively, active assisted ROM was equivalent between the groups, although the ASES and Constant scores were significantly lower for the FS group (P < .033 and P < .001, respectively). The retear rates were 5.3% and 12.3% for the FS and NFS groups, respectively (P = .013). Conclusion: Preoperative frozen shoulder positively affected rotator cuff healing but negatively affected most functional outcomes, including ROM, at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. At 2 years after surgery, there was no significant difference in active motion, but outcome scores remained lower in the FS group. For patients with preoperative frozen shoulder, a delay in surgery for additional physical therapy might not be necessary. The retear rate for the NFS group was more than double that for the FS group in the current study, which indicates that surgery for an RCT combined with frozen shoulder might provide better results in the long term because of an intact, healed rotator cuff.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis of rotator cuff repair (RCR) may be affected by the shape and quality of the torn rotator cuff tendon. However, only a few studies have reported on folded rotator cuff tears (FCTs). Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors for FCT and clinical outcomes of FCT repair. METHODS: Through propensity score matching (PSM), 200 (40 patients with FCTs and 160 controls) of 1927 patients who underwent RCR from 2010 to 2016 were included. The variables not used for PSM were compared. The anatomic and functional outcomes were assessed at the final follow-up (32.3 +/- 21.2 months), and the related prognostic factors for FCTs were evaluated. RESULTS: The risk factors for FCT were heel-type spur (odds ratio [OR], 11.6; P < .001) and delamination (OR, 2.3; P = .034). Although the functional scores at the final follow-up for both groups improved postoperatively and were not significantly different, the visual analog scale scores for pain (1.9 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.2 +/- 1.7, P = .034) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) scores (83.1 +/- 14.3 vs. 88.5 +/- 12.2, P = .018) were significantly worse in the FCT group at 6 months postoperation. The retear rate was significantly higher in the FCT group (25.0 vs. 10.0%, P = .018). An FCT was a significant risk factor for retears (OR, 3.0; P = .015); however, a subgroup analysis revealed that the retear rate according to the management strategy for the folded portion (debridement of the folded portion vs. en masse repair including the folded portion) was not significantly different (26.7 vs. 24.0%, P > .99). CONCLUSION: The risk factors for FCTs were heel-type spur and delamination. The retear rate was significantly higher for patients with FCTs. An FCT was indicative of poor quality of the remaining tendon; therefore, FCT may be a prognostic factor for worse functional outcomes during the early postoperative period and poor healing potential.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of adding multiple channeling of the greater tuberosity on the structural integrity of the repaired rotator cuff tendon. METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and postoperative computed tomography arthrography (CTA) were included in this study; 31 consecutive patients that underwent conventional repair and 25 subsequent patients that underwent conventional repair with multiple channeling. Using CTA, the repaired rotator cuff was evaluated as either intact, incomplete, or complete leakage at the insertion and in the tendon separately. The integrity type and overall integrity was then determined by the combination of the insertion and tendon grade. Factors affecting integrity were also evaluated. RESULTS: At the insertion, multiple channeling significantly improved integrity; complete leakage in 35.5% in the conventional group and 4.0% in the multiple channeling group (P = 0.017). In the tendon, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Integrity types were significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.009). For overall integrity, discontinuity was more frequently identified in the conventional group (35.5%) than in the multiple channeling group (16.0%), but it was not statistically significant. With regard to causes of discontinuity, all were due to retears in the conventional group, while 75% were due to new tears in the multiple channeling group (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Multiple channeling is simple and easily performed without any special instrument and might augment the healing of repaired rotator cuff tendons. It could be a useful technique in rotator cuff repair helping healing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been recently used to enhance and accelerate the healing of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases, but evidence is still lacking, especially on its effects after rotator cuff repair. HYPOTHESIS: Platelet-rich plasma accelerates recovery after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in pain relief, functional outcome, overall satisfaction, and enhanced structural integrity of repaired tendon. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Forty-two patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears were included. Patients were informed about the use of PRP before surgery and decided themselves whether to have PRP placed at the time of surgery. Nineteen patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with PRP and 23 without. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared via plateletpheresis and applied in the form of a gel threaded to a suture and placed at the interface between tendon and bone. Outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, and finally at a minimum of 16 months after surgery (at an average of 19.7 +/- 1.9 months) with respect to pain, range of motion, strength, and overall satisfaction, and with respect to functional scores as determined using the following scoring systems: the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) system, the Constant system, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) system, the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) system, the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) system, and the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) system. At a minimum of 9 months after surgery, repaired tendon structural integrities were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Platelet-rich plasma gel application to arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs did not accelerate recovery with respect to pain, range of motion, strength, functional scores, or overall satisfaction as compared with conventional repair at any time point. Whereas magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a retear rate of 26.7% in the PRP group and 41.2% in the conventional group, there was no statistical significance between the groups (P = .388). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that PRP application during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair did not clearly demonstrate accelerated recovery clinically or anatomically except for an improvement in internal rotation. Nevertheless, as the study may have been underpowered to detect clinically important differences in the structural integrity, additional investigations, including the optimization of PRP preparation and a larger randomized study powered for healing rate, are necessary to further determine the effect of PRP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple channeling is a straightforward additional procedure for rotator cuff repair that creates multiple channels in the greater tuberosity, through which bone marrow of the proximal humerus communicates with the repair site. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of multiple channeling on clinical and structural outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 124 patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear were included in the study. Fifty-seven patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with multiple channeling (the multiple channeling group) and 67 without it (the conventional group). Analysis of surface markers was performed to characterize the cells recruited by multiple channeling using flow cytometry. Clinical outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years after surgery (average, 36.79 +/- 13.69 months) with respect to pain, range of motion, muscle strength, overall satisfaction, and commonly used functional scores. At a minimum of 9 months after surgery, structural integrity was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography arthrography. RESULTS: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) positive for CD73, CD90, and CD105 and negative for CD45 could be isolated and cultured from bone marrow mononuclear cells of the proximal humerus. Clinical outcomes, including pain, range of motion, strength, overall satisfaction, and functional scores, showed no statistical difference between the 2 groups (all P > .05). The retear rate of the multiple channeling group (22.2%) was significantly lower than that of the conventional group (45.2%) (P = .023). CONCLUSION: The findings of the study showed that multiple channeling significantly decreased the retear rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, probably via the recruitment of endogenous MSCs from the proximal humerus. Although the results did not show significant differences in the clinical outcomes between the 2 groups, better clinical outcomes might be anticipated in the multiple channeling group via improved structural integrity in a long-term follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The change in the cross-sectional area of a repaired muscle, measured with use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), could be an indicator of recovery of muscle function. The aims of this study were to evaluate the change in the area of the supraspinatus muscle between the immediately postoperative and one-year postoperative MRIs and to identify factors associated with the change. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear were included. MRI was performed three days and one year after surgery. Patients were classified into two groups according to whether the area of the supraspinatus increased or decreased between these two time points. Outcomes including pain, shoulder motion, strength, and commonly used clinical scores were assessed preoperatively and at three, six, and twelve months after surgery. Changes in the rotator cuff muscles and retear of the repaired tendon were also evaluated. RESULTS: The area of the supraspinatus muscle increased in twenty-nine (33%) of the patients and decreased in fifty-nine (67%). The change in area was 36.75 +/- 27.94 mm2 in the group in which it increased and -94.25 +/- 70.38 mm2 in the group in which it decreased (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis indicated that a lower preoperative Simple Shoulder Test (SST) score, better gross visual grade of the tendon at surgery, and greater strength of the supraspinatus at six months postoperatively were associated with an increase in the area. No retear or Sugaya grade of 3 was found in any patient in whom the area increased, whereas 34% of the patients in whom the area decreased had a retear (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the cross-sectional area of the supraspinatus muscle could either increase or decrease during the first year after rotator cuff repair and that robust healing (indicated by a Sugaya grade of 1 or 2) and good tendon quality at surgery were important factors associated with an increase in the area. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in rotator cuff repair <b>.</b> METHODS: Seventeen patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear were included. Ten patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with allogeneic, and seven patients with autologous PRP. Three PRP gels in a volume 3 ml each were applied between the torn end and the greater tuberosity. Clinical outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years after surgery. Structural outcomes were evaluated with the presence of retear and the change of the cross-sectional area (ACT) of the supraspinatus <b>.</b> RESULTS: Allogeneic PRP did not cause any adverse events during the follow-up period. There was no significant difference in the clinical outcome measures between the two groups (all p > 0.05). The retear rate was 33.3% and 25.0% in the allogeneic group and autologous group, respectively (p = 0.764). The change between the one-year postoperative and immediately postoperative ACT was not also significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.373) <b>.</b> CONCLUSION: Allogeneic PRP in arthroscopic rotator cuff did not cause any local or general complications and that has the efficacy comparable to autologous PRP with respect to the clinical and structural outcomes. <b>Level of Evidence III, Retrospective Comparative Study.</b>

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical outcomes and tendon integrity in patients with chronic retracted subscapularis tears using an arthroscopic single-row oblique mattress suture repair technique. METHODS: Patients with full-thickness subscapularis tears retracted to the glenoid level and with at least 2 years of follow-up were included. Tendon retraction level was measured on preoperative axial magnetic resonance images and confirmed during arthroscopic surgery. The subscapularis tendon was repaired arthroscopically using the single-row oblique mattress suture technique on the medial margin of the lesser tuberosity. Two double-loaded suture anchors were used to obtain firm fixation between the tendon and the footprint. Clinical outcomes were assessed for all patients preoperatively and postoperatively using active range of motion, a visual analog scale score for pain, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Constant scores. To evaluate structural integrity of the repaired tendon, all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months and ultrasonography at 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: The shoulder function of the 33 patients analyzed was improved significantly after a mean follow-up period of 26.3 +/- 3.5 months compared with preoperative values (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score of 52.0 +/- 7.9 preoperatively vs 79.6 +/- 7.0 at last follow-up, P < .001, and Constant score of 43.0 +/- 13.4 preoperatively vs 76.7 +/- 9.2 at last follow-up, P < .001). Postoperative active range of motion improved significantly in forward flexion, external rotation, and internal rotation (P < .001). The mean visual analog scale pain score decreased by 3.42 (5.2 +/- 1.6 preoperatively vs 1.9 +/- 1.4 at last follow-up, P < .001). In 4 patients (12.1%), subscapularis retears were confirmed on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Despite significant retraction, arthroscopic repair using a single-row oblique mattress suture technique in patients who had chronic subscapularis tears with retraction to the glenoid level yielded satisfactory clinical outcomes and reliable tendon healing. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern rotator cuff repair techniques demonstrate favorable early and midterm outcomes, but long-term results have yet to be reported. PURPOSE: To determine 10-year outcomes and survivorship after arthroscopic double-row transosseous-equivalent (TOE) rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence 4. METHODS: The primary TOE rotator cuff repair procedure was performed using either a knotted suture bridge or knotless tape bridge technique on a series of patients with 1 to 3 tendon full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus. Only patients who were 10 years postsurgery were included. Patient-reported outcomes were collected pre- and postoperatively, including American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH), and satisfaction. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis was performed. Failure was defined as progression to revision surgery. RESULTS: A total of 91 shoulders (56 men, 31 women) were included between October 2005 and December 2009. Mean follow-up was 11.5 years (range, 10.0-14.1 years). Of 91 shoulders, 5 (5.5%) failed and required revision surgery. Patient-reported outcomes for patients who survived were known for 80% (69/86). Outcomes scores at final follow-up were as follows: ASES, 93.1 +/- 10.8; SANE, 87.5 +/- 14.2; QuickDASH, 11.1 +/- 13.5; and SF-12 physical component summary (PCS), 49.2 +/- 10.1. There were statistically significant declines in ASES, SANE, and SF-12 PCS from the 5-year to 10-year follow-up, but none of these changes met the minimally clinically important difference threshold. Median satisfaction at final follow-up was 10 (range, 3-10). From this cohort, Kaplan-Meier survivorship demonstrated a 94.4% survival rate at a minimum of 10 years. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic TOE rotator cuff repair demonstrates high patient satisfaction and low revision rates at a mean follow-up of 11.5 years. This information may be directly utilized in surgical decision making and preoperative patient counseling regarding the longevity of modern double-row rotator cuff repair.

AB  - PURPOSE: While a conventional single- or double-row repair technique could be applied for repair of C-shaped tears, a different surgical strategy should be considered for repair of U- or L-shaped tears because they typically have complex patterns with anterior, posterior, or both mobile leaves. This study was performed to examine the outcomes of the modified Mason-Allen technique for footprint restoration in the treatment of large U- or L-shaped rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Thirty-two patients who underwent an arthroscopic modified Mason-Allen technique for large U- or L-shaped rotator cuff tears between January 2012 and December 2013 were included in this study. Margin convergence was first performed to reduce the tear gap and tension, and then, an arthroscopic Mason-Allen technique was performed to restore the rotator cuff footprint in a side-to-end repair fashion. All patients were evaluated preoperatively and for a minimum of 2 years of follow-up with a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Constant score, and ultrasonography. RESULTS: There was significant improvement in all VAS and Constant scores compared with the preoperative values (P < 0.001). Functional results by Constant scores included 9 cases that were classified as excellent, 11 cases as good, 8 cases as fair, and 2 cases as poor. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that heavy work, pseudoparalysis, joint space narrowing, fatty degeneration of the SST and IST, and a positive tangent sign were found to significantly correlate with functional outcomes. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that only fatty degeneration of the SST was a risk factor for fair/poor clinical outcomes. Complications occurred in 5 of the 32 patients (15.6 %), and the reoperation rate due to complications was 6.3 % (2 of 32 patients). CONCLUSIONS: An arthroscopic modified Mason-Allen technique was sufficient to restore the footprint of the rotator cuff in our data. Overall satisfactory results were achieved in most patients, with the exception of those with severe fatty degeneration. An arthroscopic modified Mason-Allen technique could be an effective and reliable alternative for patients with large U- or L-shaped rotator cuff tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case Series, Therapeutic Level IV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural course of and risk factors for tear progression in full-thickness rotator cuff tears (FTRCTs) have not been clarified yet. The study's purpose was to retrospectively evaluate tear progression in FTRCTs by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to identify risk factors that are relevant to such tear progression. METHODS: Between June 2010 and September 2019, a total of 345 patients with FTRCTs who had been diagnosed via MRI were treated conservatively. Of these, 48 patients who underwent post-treatment follow-up MRI were retrospectively enrolled. Tear progression was defined as significant when the tear size increased by >5 mm. RESULTS: The mean MRI follow-up duration was 22 +/- 14 months (range, 12-65 months). Among the 48 patients (mean age, 69 years; range, 53-81), 26 (54%) and 20 (41%) showed medial-lateral (M-L) and anterior-posterior (A-P) tear progression on MRI follow-up. Multivariate analysis revealed that MRI follow-up duration (P = .011), diabetes mellitus (P = .017), and infraspinatus muscle atrophy (P = .011) were independent risk factors for tear progression in the A-P plane. A high critical shoulder angle (P = .011) and supraspinatus (P = .024) and infraspinatus (P = .020) muscle atrophy were risk factors associated with M-L tear progression. CONCLUSION: Among the assessed patients, a considerable number of FTRCTs increased in size during the follow-up period. Severe infraspinatus muscle atrophy was the independent risk factor for exacerbation of A-P and M-L tear progression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, Propionibacterium acnes was reported to be involved in postsurgical outcomes. We investigated the detection rate of P. acnes and clinical features of P. acnes infection following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: Samples were collected from skin swabs before preparation, swabs of the synovium, sutures, and swabs from the arthroscope tip. We evaluated age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, preoperative contracture, operation time, blood test, Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, cuff integrity, deep infection, and positive inoculation rate. RESULTS: We studied 90 patients (59 men and 31 women). Mean age was 60.6 years. Cultures of P. acnes showed a 65.5% positive superficial colonization rate (78.0%, male; 41.9%, female). Among the synovium swabs, P. acnes was detected in 13.6% and 0% of patients positive and negative for skin colonization with P. acnes, respectively. Positive culture was not correlated with age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, preoperative contracture, blood test, JOA score, cuff integrity, deep infection, operation time, and blood test date. CONCLUSIONS: P. acnes was detected at a higher rate in the skin of male patients. Patients with P. acnes detected on the skin showed higher rates of detection in the synovium. These findings suggest that the route of infection is via contamination. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic level III; Case-control study.

AB  - In recent years, Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) has been reported to affect postoperative outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the detection rate and clinical features of C. acnes infection after open shoulder surgery. Fifty-nine patients (33 males and 26 females; mean age, 69.1 years) were included. Samples were collected from a skin swab at the incision site prior to skin preparation. Further samples were collected from synovial swabs at the glenohumeral joint immediately after incision and before incision closure. Samples with C. acnes-positive skin swab cultures were defined as Group A, and those with negative cultures were defined as Group N. Age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, operation time, presence of deep infection after surgery, and rate of positive synovial swab cultures were compared between groups. There were 27 patients in Group A (mean age 69.1+/-13.3 [SD], 21 males and 6 females) and 32 patients in Group N (mean age 69.1+/-11.0 [SD], 12 males and 20 females). No significant difference in the presence of diabetes mellitus and operation time were found between groups. From the glenohumeral joint immediately after incision, C. acnes was detected in 22.2% and 0% of patients in Group A and Group N, respectively. For the glenohumeral joint before incision closure, C. acnes was detected in 22.2% and 0% of patients in Group A and Group N, respectively, demonstrating a significantly higher rate in Group A. Our findings suggest that the route of infection following open shoulder surgery is via contamination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The suture-bridge (SB) method has recently become the mainstream means of repairing full-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, in some patients the deep and superficial layers have moved in different directions because of delamination of their rotator cuffs. In such cases, a simple suture (double-layer, double-row [DD] method) is used to repair the superficial and deep layers separately. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical outcomes and re-tear rates of the DD and SB methods, with patients selected according to the condition of their torn cuffs. METHODS: We retrospectively registered 74 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears that had been repaired arthroscopically, 35 shoulders by the DD and 39 by the SB method. Mean ages were 66.1 years in the DD and 62.9 years in the SB group. We evaluated clinical status before and after surgery (Japanese Orthopedic Association [JOA] scores) and re-tear rate. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to compare JOA scores and active ROM between before and after surgery in each group. Mann-Whitney's U test was used for comparing JOA scores, active ROM, re-tear rates, size of tear, duration of follow-up, sex, and presence of subscapular muscle repair between the DD and SB groups. A hazard ratio of less than 5% was considered to denote significance. RESULTS: JOA scores improved significantly in the DD and SB groups from preoperative means of 63.4 and 63.3 points, respectively, to postoperative means of 91.8 and 92.1 points, respectively. The active flexural ROM improved significantly from means of 110.1degree and 100.0degree, respectively, to postoperative means of 142.3degree and 142.7degree, respectively; the differences between groups were not significant. Re-tear occurred in 5.9% of the DD (two of 34 shoulders) and 7.9% of the SB group (three of 38 shoulders); its incidence did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both the DD and SB methods achieve satisfactory clinical outcomes that do not differ significantly. Our results suggest that careful selection of operative method on the basis of the delamination pattern in patients undergoing RCT may reduce the re-tear rate after utilizing the SB method.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate texture data of the torn supraspinatus tendon (SST) on preoperative T2-weighted magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) for prediction of post-operative tendon state. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for full-thickness tears of the SST were included in this retrospective study. Based on 1-year follow-up, magnetic resonance imaging showed that 30 patients had intact SSTs, and 20 had rotator cuff retears. Using GLCM, two radiologists measured independantly the highest signal intensity area of the distal end of the torn SST on preoperative T2-weighted MRA, which were compared between two groups. The relationships with other well-known prognostic factors, including age, tear size (anteroposterior dimension), retraction size (mediolateral tear length), grade of fatty degeneration of the SST and infraspinatus tendon, and arthroscopic fixation technique (single or double row), also were evaluated. RESULTS: Of all the GLCM features, the retear group showed significantly higher entropy (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001), variance (p = 0.030 and 0.011), and contrast (p = 0.033 and 0.012), but lower angular second moment (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002) and inverse difference moment (p = 0.027 and 0.027), as well as larger tear size (p = 0.001) and retraction size (p = 0.002) than the intact group. Retraction size (odds ratio [OR] = 3.053) and entropy (OR = 17.095) were significant predictors. CONCLUSION: Texture analysis of torn SSTs on preoperative T2-weighted MRA using the GLCM may be helpful to predict postoperative tendon state after rotator cuff repair.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between smoking status and postoperative complications within 30 days of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried to identify all patients who underwent ARCR from 2015 to 2017. Smokers were defined as patients who reported smoking cigarettes in the year prior to rotator cuff repair. Patients who used chewing tobacco, cigars, or electronic cigarettes were not included in the smoking cohort. Postoperative complications were reported within 30 days of the procedure. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between smoking status and postoperative complications. Results: There were 18,594 patients included in this study. Of these patients, 2834 (15.2%) were current smokers. Smokers were more likely to be men, to be aged < 65 years, and to have a body mass index < 30. Smokers were also more likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to be functionally dependent, and to have an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class >= 3. After adjustment for all significantly associated patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities, smoking was identified as a significant predictor of surgical complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.955; P = .022), return to the operating room (OR, 2.547; P = .003), readmission (OR, 1.570; P = .014), and sepsis or septic shock (OR, 4.737; P = .021). Smoking was not a significant predictor of medical complications (OR, 1.105; P = .687) or surgical-site infections (OR, 1.216; P = .713). Conclusion: Smoking may be a risk factor for surgical complications, readmission, and sepsis or septic shock within 30 days of ARCR.

AB  - Background: Degenerative greater tuberosity (GT) changes are often associated with rotator cuff tears. However, little is known about the impact of GT morphology on surgical outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between clinical and radiological outcomes, after rotator cuff repair, and GT morphology. Methods: We retrospectively investigated shoulders that underwent arthroscopic repair of nontraumatic full-thickness supra-/infraspinatus tears. The exclusion criteria were a lack of either radiographs or magnetic resonance images, revision surgery, partial repair, complications such as infection or dislocation, and follow-up < 2 years. GT morphology on radiographs was classified into 5 groups: normal, sclerosis, bone spur, roughness, and femoralization. The acromiohumeral interval (AHI) was measured on anteroposterior radiographs. Fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles was evaluated using the global fatty degeneration index (GFDI). Postoperative cuff integrity was classified using Sugaya's classification at 2 years after surgery. Clinical outcomes were assessed preoperatively and at postoperative 2 years with the Japanese Orthopaedic Association score and the University of California, Los Angeles shoulder rating scale. Results: The study included 220 shoulders in 212 patients (104 men and 108 women), with a mean age of 66 years (range 43-85). The mean follow-up period was 28 months (range, 24-60 months). Seven shoulders (3.2%) were classified as normal, 65 (29.5%) as sclerosis, 55 (25.0%) as bone spur, 78 (34.5%) as roughness, and 15 (6.8%) as femoralization. The preoperative AHI, in the roughness and femoralization groups, was significantly smaller than that in the sclerosis (P < .01) and bone spur groups (P < .001). The roughness and femoralization groups had a greater number of large tears (P = .006). In the roughness and femoralization groups, mean GFDI was significantly higher than that in the sclerosis group (P < .001 for both). Repaired cuff integrity was not different between all groups, respectively. Both Japanese Orthopaedic Association and University of California, Los Angeles scores improved postoperatively from 73.3 to 95.6 points and 18.2 to 34.0 points (P < .001 for both), respectively, and there were no significant differences between all groups, respectively. Conclusion: Roughness or femoralization of the GT was related to larger tears, with smaller AHI and higher GFDI. Repaired cuff integrity and clinical outcomes in shoulders with roughness or femoralization of the GT were not inferior to shoulders with the other types of GT morphologies in this study. Arthroscopic repair can be indicated for shoulders with advanced changes of the GT, if fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles is not severe.

AB  - PURPOSE: To ascertain trends and reported complication rates of arthroscopic and open or mini-open rotator cuff repairs (RCRs) reported by American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part II examinees between 2007-2017. METHODS: The ABOS database was queried for both arthroscopic RCR (International Classification of Diseases code 29827) and open or mini-open RCR (International Classification of Diseases codes 23410 and 23412) performed by Part II examinees from 2007-2017. A comparison between overall procedure rates, as well as reported complications (anesthetic, medical, surgical, reoperations, and readmissions) associated with the respective repair technique, was performed. RESULTS: From 2007-2017, a total of 31,907 RCRs were reported by Part II examinees. Of those, 85.2% (n = 27,189) were arthroscopic whereas 14.8% (n = 4,718) were open or mini-open. The rate of arthroscopic RCR increased from 73% (n = 2,138) in 2007 to 90% (n = 2,031) in 2017, whereas the rate of open or mini-open RCR decreased from 27% (n = 771) to 10% (n = 234) during the same period. Rates of reported annual complications were significantly lower for arthroscopic RCR (7.4%-16.2%) than for open or mini-open RCR (12.9%-30.3%) for each of the past 6 years (2012-2017) (P < .001). Arthroscopic RCR had an overall lower cumulative occurrence of complications than open or mini-open RCR over the past decade (2007-2017) (P < .001). The relative risk of complications for arthroscopic RCR compared with open RCR was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: ABOS Part II examinees reported an increased practice of arthroscopic RCR in comparison with open or mini-open RCR over the past 10 years. Reported annual complication rates have been significantly lower for arthroscopic RCR over the past 6 years, with an overall lower cumulative rate from 2007-2017. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injections are sometimes used in the postoperative period after shoulder arthroscopy; however, a well-defined safety profile has not been established. PURPOSE: To examine the association between the timing of postoperative corticosteroid injections and rates of infection after shoulder arthroscopy. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Private payer and Medicare national insurance databases were queried for patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, debridement, or subacromial decompression. Patients who underwent corticosteroid injections within 1, 2, 3, or 4 months postoperatively were identified and compared with a matched control group that underwent the same procedures without a postoperative steroid injection. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify rates of postoperative infection within 90 days after injection for the study groups and controls. Multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis was used to compare groups, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated, with P < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 3946 patients were identified, including 264 patients who received an injection within 1 month after surgery, 471 within 2 months, 1037 within 3 months, 1874 within 4 months, and 2640 matched controls. When compared with controls, patients who underwent a corticosteroid injection within 1 month postoperatively had a significantly higher rate of infection (private payer: OR, 2.63; P = .014; Medicare: OR, 11.2; P < .0001). There were no differences in infection rates at all other time points ( P = .264-.835). CONCLUSION: This study adds to the evidence suggesting caution when administering injections in the immediate postoperative period after shoulder arthroscopy. Although causality cannot be determined on the basis of this database review, the authors found a significant association between intra-articular corticosteroid injections administered 1 month postoperatively and an increased rate of postoperative infection in Medicare and private payer patient cohorts as compared with a control group.

AB  - Purpose: To compare 90-day postoperative complications between patients undergoing outpatient versus inpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs (RCR) and identify risk factors associated with postoperative complications. Method(s): An administrative claims database was used to identify patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR from 2007 to 2015. Patients were categorized based on length of hospital stay (LOS) with inpatient RCR defined as patients with >=1 day LOS, and outpatient RCR as patients discharged day of surgery (LOS = 0). Inpatient and outpatient RCR groups were matched based on age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), and various medical comorbidities using 1:1 propensity score analysis. Patient factors, concomitant procedures, total adverse events (TAEs), medical adverse events (MAEs), and surgical adverse events (SAEs) were compared between the matched groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with increased complications. Result(s): After matching, there were 2812 patients (50% outpatient) included in the study. Within 90 days following arthroscopic RCR, the incidence of TAEs (8.9% vs 3.6%, P <.0001), SAEs (2.7% vs 0.9%, P =.0002), and MAEs (6.4% vs 3.0%, P <.0001) were significantly greater for the inpatient RCR group. The multivariate model identified inpatient RCR (LOS >=1 day), greater CCI, and anxiety or depression as independent predictors for TAEs after arthroscopic RCR. Open biceps tenodesis and inpatient RCR were independent predictors of SAEs, whereas greater CCI, anxiety or depression, and inpatient RCR were independent predictors for MAEs within 90 days after arthroscopic RCR. Conclusion(s): Inpatient arthroscopic RCR is associated with increased risk of 90-day postoperative complications compared with outpatient. However, there is no difference for all-cause or pain-related emergency department visits within 90 days after surgery. In addition, the multivariate model identified inpatient RCR, greater CCI, and diagnosis of anxiety or depression as independent risk factors for 90-day TAEs after arthroscopic RCR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most commonly used imaging modality to assess the rotator cuff. Currently, there are a limited number of studies assessing the interobserver and intraobserver reliability of MRI after rotator cuff repair. HYPOTHESIS: Fellowship-trained orthopaedic shoulder surgeons will have good inter- and intraobserver agreement with regard to features of the repaired rotator cuff (repair integrity, fat content, muscle volume, number of tendons involved, tear size, and retract) on MRI. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Seven fellowship-trained orthopaedic shoulder surgeons reviewed 31 MRI scans from 31 shoulders from patients who had previous rotator cuff repair. The scans were evaluated for the following characteristics: rotator cuff repair status (full-thickness retear vs intact repair), tear location, tendon thickness, fatty infiltration, atrophy, number of tendons involved in retear, tendon retraction, status of the long head of the biceps tendon, and bone marrow edema in the humeral head. Surgeons were asked to review images at 2 separate time points approximately 9 months apart and complete an evaluation form for each scan at each time point. Multirater kappa (kappa) statistics were used to assess inter- and intraobserver reliability. RESULTS: The interobserver agreement was highest (80%, kappa = 0.60) for identifying full-thickness retears, tendon retear retraction (64%, kappa = 0.45), and cysts in the greater tuberosity (72%, kappa = 0.43). All other variables were found to have fair to poor agreement. The worst interobserver agreement was associated with identifying rotator cuff footprint coverage (47%, kappa = -0.21) and tendon signal intensity (29%, kappa = -0.01). The mean intraobserver reproducibility was also highest (77%-90%, kappa = 0.71) for full-thickness retears, quality of the supraspinatus (47%-83%, kappa = 0.52), tears of the long head of the biceps tendon (58%-94%, kappa = 0.49), presence of bone marrow edema in the humeral head (63%-87%, kappa = 0.48), cysts in the greater tuberosity (70%-83%, kappa = 0.47), signal in the long head of the biceps tendon (60%-80%, kappa = 0.43), and quality of the infraspinatus (37-90%, kappa = 0.43). The worst intraobserver reproducibility was found in identification of the location of bone marrow edema (22%-83%, kappa = -0.03). CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that there is substantial variability when evaluating MRI scans after rotator cuff repair. Intact rotator cuff repairs or full-thickness retears can be identified with moderate reliability. These findings indicate that additional imaging modalities may be needed for accurate assessment of the repaired rotator cuff.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acromiohumeral distance (AHD) has become both a diagnostic and prognostic parameter related to rotator cuff pathology which is always measured in a 2-dimensional plane. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the regional AHD with MRI following open and arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and, (2) to investigate its association to the rotator cuff integrity following medium to large size rotator cuff repair with open and arthroscopic manner. METHODS: A retrospective review of 112 patients who were treated for full-thickness medium to large size rotator cuff tears either by open repair (open group) or arthroscopic repair (arthroscopic group) was done. All patients included in the study are those with at least 12 and 18 months for the post-operative MRI and clinical follow-up. Propensity score matching was used to select controls matched for age, sex, body mass index, tear size, and affected site. There were 56 patients in each group with a mean age of 63.3 years (range, 50 to 77 years). The post-operative functional and radiologic outcomes for both groups were compared. AHD was measured at three regions of interest (ROI) with MRI and compared pre-and post-operatively. RESULTS: AHD was significantly greater in the open group when measured at the anterior third of the lateral acromion border compare to the arthroscopic group (p = 0.005). The re-tear rate was affected by AHD at the anterior third of the lateral border of the acromion for the arthroscopic and open group (p = 0.021, p = 0.029). The AHD measured at the anterior and middle third of lateral acromion border were significantly greater in healed compared to the re-tear rotator cuff group (p = 0.019, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Open rotator cuff repair showed greater AHD at the anterior third of the lateral border of the acromion. Regional AHD measured at anterior third of the lateral border of acromion significantly associated with rotator cuff integrity following repair. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: propensity-matched case-control (Level II).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only a few studies have examined repair integrity and functional outcome after arthroscopic suture-bridge rotator cuff repair procedure. In addition, no reported study has compared outcomes between the suture-bridge and double-row techniques. PURPOSE: This study compared the functional outcome and repair integrity of arthroscopic double-row and conventional suture-bridge repair in full-thickness rotator cuff tears. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive full-thickness rotator cuff tears with 1 to 4 cm of anterior to posterior dimension that underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were included. A double-row technique was used in the first 26 consecutive shoulders, and a conventional suture-bridge technique was used in the next 26 consecutive shoulders. Fifty shoulders (92.5%) underwent magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were evaluated a minimum 2 years (mean, 37.2 months; range, 24-54) postoperatively using the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and Constant scores. The postoperative cuff integrity was evaluated a mean of 33.0 (range, 10-54) months postoperatively. RESULTS: At the final follow-up, the average UCLA, ASES, and Constant scores improved significantly, to 32.3, 90.5, and 80.7, respectively, in the double-row group and to 30.6, 88.5, and 74.0, respectively, in the suture-bridge group. The UCLA, ASES, and Constant scores improved in both groups postoperatively (all P < .001); however, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups at final follow-up (P = .185, .585, and .053, respectively). The retear rate was 24% in the shoulders that underwent double-row repair and 20% in the shoulders that underwent suture-bridge repair; this difference was not statistically significant (P = .733). CONCLUSION: The arthroscopic conventional suture-bridge technique resulted in comparable patient satisfaction, functional outcome, and rates of retear compared with the arthroscopic double-row technique in full-thickness rotator cuff tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the clinical and imaging outcomes of arthroscopic suture-bridge repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. METHODS: From May 2007 to April 2008, seventy-nine patients with a full-thickness rotator cuff tear consecutively underwent arthroscopic suture-bridge repair. The mean age of the patients was 58.3 years (range, thirty-eight to seventy-eight years), and the mean duration of follow-up was 30.6 months (range, twenty-four to forty-four months). Seventy-three patients underwent postoperative ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging; seventy-one underwent the imaging at a minimum of two years postoperatively, and the remaining two did so after the operation because of persistent symptoms. The clinical results of seventy-seven patients (all except two who had undergone revision) were evaluated at a minimum of two years postoperatively. University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and Constant-Murley scores were used for clinical and functional evaluations before surgery and at the time of final follow-up. RESULTS: The imaging follow-up rate was 92%, and the follow-up rate for clinical evaluation was 100%. The re-tear rate after suture-bridge repair was 15%. The re-tear rate of the medium, large, and massive tears (as classified according to the anterior-to-posterior diameter of the tear) was 12%, 21%, and 22%, respectively. Massive and large tears tended to show a higher re-tear rate than did medium tears, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.417 and p = 0.964, respectively). The mean UCLA, ASES, and Constant-Murley scores improved from 21.6, 50.4, and 52.7 preoperatively to 30.9, 86.2, and 74.7 at the time of final follow-up (p < 0.001). However, the clinical outcomes after the operation did not differ significantly between the patients who had healing of the tear and those who did not (p = 0.438, p = 0.625, and p = 0.898 for the UCLA, ASES, and Constant-Murley scores, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic suture-bridge repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears was followed by a re-tear rate of 15% as seen with imaging and resulted in significant improvement of functional outcomes and clinical results compared with the preoperative findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No reported study has compared the clinical outcomes of suture bridge techniques. PURPOSE: To compare the functional outcomes and repair integrity of the arthroscopic single-mattress (SM), double-pulley (DP), and double-mattress (DM) suture bridge (SB) techniques for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Seventy-eight consecutive shoulders with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and a 1- to 4-cm anteroposterior dimension underwent arthroscopic SB repairs. The SM-SB technique was used in the first 26 consecutive shoulders, the DP-SB method was used in the second 26 consecutive shoulders, and the DM-SB repair was used in the final 26 consecutive shoulders. Seventy-four shoulders (94.9%) underwent postoperative evaluation for cuff integrity using MRI or ultrasound. Clinical outcomes were evaluated in 76 shoulders (97.4%) at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the shoulder rating scale of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and Constant scores at an average of 31 months postoperatively. RESULTS: At final follow-up, the average ASES, UCLA, and Constant scores improved significantly: respective scores were 88.46, 30.58, and 73.96 in the SM-SB group (P < .001); 87.19, 31.35, and 72.50 in the DP-SB group (P < .001); and 87.19, 32.81, and 75.35 in the DM-SB group (P < .001). However, there were no significant differences among the 3 groups in terms of the ASES, UCLA, or Constant scores (P = .954, .210, and .755, respectively). The retear rate of repaired rotator cuffs was 20% in the SM-SB group, 12.5% in the DP-SB group, and 12% in the DM-SB group; however, the differences among the 3 groups were not statistically significant (P = .674). The number of suture anchors (mean +/- SD) used for repair was 4.31 +/- 0.47 in the SM-SB group, 4.00 +/- 0.00 in the DP-SB group, and 3.38 +/- 0.50 in the DM-SB group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair yielded successful functional outcomes without significant differences among the 3 SB techniques. Additionally, no significant differences in repair integrity were observed among the 3 methods postoperatively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic margin convergence for rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears, in which the free tendon edge could not be reduced to the footprint after the release and mobilization of the rotator cuff tendon, were included. Rotator cuff repair integrity was determined by magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography after the operation. The mean age and follow-up period for the patients were 59.6 years (range, forty-eight to seventy-three years) and 30.6 months (range, twenty-four to sixty months), respectively. Five outcome measures were used before surgery and at the time of the final follow-up: a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Shoulder Rating Scale of the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), the Constant-Murley score, and the range of shoulder motion. RESULTS: The follow-up rate for imaging was 95.8%, and the follow-up rate for clinical evaluation was 91.7%. The mean UCLA score (and standard deviation) improved from 17.4 +/- 5.5 preoperatively to 31.6 +/- 4.0 at the time of the final follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean ASES score improved from 54.9 +/- 23.3 to 91.3 +/- 11.8, respectively (p < 0.001). The mean Constant-Murley score improved from 45.9 +/- 17.6 to 79.1 +/- 12.6 (p < 0.001). The mean VAS score improved from 6.5 +/- 1.7 to 1.3 +/- 1.5 (p < 0.001). The mean range of motion (forward flexion) improved from 117.9degree +/- 37.7degree to 166.8degree +/- 16.7degree (p < 0.001). The postoperative imaging examinations showed cuff integrity without a retear in 52.2% of the shoulders. However, the UCLA, ASES, and Constant-Murley scores were not significantly different between healed and unhealed groups (p = 0.800, p = 0.322, and p = 0.597, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Reducing tension by margin convergence followed by a repair of the resulting free edge to bone has reasonable short-term clinical results but a substantial retear rate (47.8%). However, the retears tended to be smaller than the original tear size. No significant difference was observed in the short-term clinical results between the groups with or without a retear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioabsorbable anchors may lead to osteolysis and cyst formation. However, the prevalence of these outcomes is not known for rotator cuff repairs. PURPOSE: To evaluate cyst formation after placement of bioabsorbable anchors for rotator cuff repairs and to verify whether bioabsorbable anchors degraded as intended and preserved bone stock for possible revision compared with metal anchors. The null hypothesis was that the rate and severity of cyst formation around the anchor are negligible. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between April 2008 and November 2011, a total of 209 patients (85 men, 124 women) underwent rotator cuff repair with bioabsorbable suture anchors (113 with polylactic acid enantiomers [PLLA] and 96 with poly-D,L-lactide from L-lactide and D-lactide [PLDLA]); the patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation more than 10 months after surgery. The fluid signal around the anchor on T2-weighted MRI scans was graded as follows: grade 0, no fluid around anchor; grade 1, minimal fluid around anchor; grade 2, local fluid around anchor; grade 3, fluid collection around entire length of anchor with cyst diameter less than twice the anchor diameter; and grade 4, cyst diameter larger than grade 3. The integrity of repairs was also evaluated. RESULTS: Cysts were observed in 97 instances (46.4%). There were 41 grade 1 cases (19.6%), 16 grade 2 (7.7%), 22 grade 3 (10.5%), and 18 grade 4 (8.6%). Healing of repaired tendon was observed in 131 patients (62.7%). There was no statistical difference in healing rate between patients with and without cyst formation (66.1% vs 58.8%; P = .276). Altered anchor shape and absorption were not observed in most of the patients. However, in 12 patients (6 with PLLA and 6 with PLDLA anchors), T2-weighted scans showed that the signal intensity of anchors had changed since surgery, which could indicate that absorption had taken place; nonetheless, even in these 12 patients, anchors were clearly visible on T1-weighted scans. CONCLUSION: Osteolysis and cyst formation are common complications following the use of bioabsorbable anchors in rotator cuff repairs. Considering that adequate absorption of anchors and preservation of bone stock are the reasons for using bioabsorbable anchors, use of these anchors should be reconsidered because of possible interference with revision surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only a few studies have reported an unusual retear pattern after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair based on the repair method. PURPOSE: To compare the retear pattern of the arthroscopic single-row technique (SRT), conventional suture-bridge technique (SBT), and knotless suture-bridge technique (K-SBT) for rotator cuff tears. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: This study evaluated 65 shoulders with retears revealed on magnetic resonance imaging at least 6 months after arthroscopic repair for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear. A retear was revealed in 21, 22, and 22 shoulders after the SRT, SBT, and K-SBT, respectively. Retears were classified as type 1 (unhealed tendons), type 2 (medially ruptured tendons with a healed footprint), or type 3 (unable to classify). Retear patterns were classified as full- or partial-thickness lesions; partial-thickness retears were further classified as articular- or bursal-side lesions. RESULTS: A type 1 retear was observed in 71.4%, 40.9%, and 54.5% and a type 2 retear in 23.8%, 59.0%, and 40.9% of patients in the SRT, SBT, and K-SBT groups, respectively. No significant differences were observed among the 3 groups together (P = .195); however, a significant difference was observed between the SRT and SBT groups alone (P = .049). No significant differences were observed for either type 1 (P = .121) or type 2 (including both full- and partial-thickness) retears (P = .064) among the 3 groups together. When respective pairs of groups were compared, a significant difference was noted in both type 1 (P = .044) and type 2 retears (P = .019) between the SRT and SBT groups alone. No significant differences were observed in type 1 (P = .281) or type 2 full-thickness retears (P = .117) among the 3 groups together. When pairs of groups were compared, a significant difference in type 2 full-thickness retears was detected between the SRT and SBT groups alone (P = .037). CONCLUSION: The SBT has a different retear pattern than that of the SRT. However, the K-SBT retear pattern was not different from that of the SRT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few clinical studies have evaluated the integrity of repaired tendons and identified the timing of retears through the use of serial imaging. HYPOTHESIS: Retears after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair are uncommon in the late postoperative period (after 3 months). STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Among 221 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs that were performed at a single hospital between May 2010 and February 2012, 61 were involved in this study. Rotator cuff tears consisted of 12 small, 31 medium, 8 large, and 6 massive rotator cuff tears. Additionally, 4 isolated subscapularis tears were included. For clinical evaluation, all patients were assessed both preoperatively and postoperatively by use of the University of California-Los Angeles Shoulder Rating Scale, absolute and relative Constant scores, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; active range of motion was assessed as well. For radiological evaluation, all 61 patients had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation at 3 months postoperatively. Among them, 23 patients were evaluated for repaired tendon integrity on postoperative MRI at a minimum of 1 year after surgery (mean, 14.1 months; range, 12-19 months), and results were classified according to the Sugaya classification: type I, sufficient thickness with homogeneously low intensity on each image; type II, sufficient thickness, partial high-intensity area; type III, less than half the thickness without discontinuity; type IV, minor discontinuity; and type V, major discontinuity. The remaining 38 patients, who refused to undergo MRI again for financial reasons, were evaluated through ultrasound. RESULTS: Statistically significant clinical improvements were observed after surgery. The MRI conducted at 3 months postoperatively identified 9 patients with Sugaya type I, 28 patients with type II, and 24 patients with type III repairs. No patients showed Sugaya type IV or V repairs at postoperative 3 months. Thirty-seven patients who had shown Sugaya type I or II repairs on 3-month postoperative MRI had no retear on imaging study at a minimum of 1 year. Of 24 patients who had shown type III repairs on 3-month postoperative MRI, 1 patient exhibited retear (Sugaya type IV) on 1-year postoperative MRI and 3 patients showed full-thickness retear on 1-year postoperative ultrasonography. All 4 of these patients had had large to massive tears preoperatively. CONCLUSION: Retears occurred infrequently in the late postoperative period (after 3 months) in well-healed tendons that had shown intact cuff repair integrity with sufficient mechanical and biological healing within the first 3 postoperative months.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of immediate rotator cuff repair with capsular release and those of rotator cuff repair after the stiffness was treated with rehabilitative therapy. Method(s): Between June 2007 and December 2010, we recruited 63 patients with rotator cuff tears and stiffness. In 33 patients arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed with capsular release simultaneously (group I). In 30 patients arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed after 6 months of preoperative rehabilitation for stiffness (group II). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test score, Constant score, and visual analog scale score for pain and range of motion (ROM) were assessed at the start of the study; at 3, 6, and 12 months; and at the last visit. The postoperative cuff tendon integrity was assessed between 6 and 12 months using magnetic resonance or ultrasound images. Result(s): There were no significant differences in preoperative demographic data between the groups (P >.05). The mean follow-up period was 21.54 months. After treatment, there was significant improvement in ROM and functional scores in both groups, as measured at the last follow-up (P <.05). No statistical differences were found in clinical scores and ROM at the last followup (P >.05). On assessment of the magnetic resonance or ultrasound images taken 6 to 12 months postoperatively, the retear rate for the repaired cuff tendon in each group was 12.1% in group I and 13.4% in group II. Conclusion(s): In the treatment of rotator cuff tears with stiffness, satisfactory results can be achieved either by repairing the tear with simultaneous capsular release or by waiting to perform the repair after preoperative rehabilitation for stiffness. Because a delayed rotator cuff repair after improving ROM offered no clear advantage over an immediate operation, we recommend surgically treating rotator cuff tears with concomitant stiffness early using a simultaneous capsular release method to save time and to avoid unnecessary rehabilitation. Level of Evidence: Level II, prospective comparative study. Copyright © 2015 by the Arthroscopy Association of North Americaa.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify factors that predict retears after arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Factors included age, sex, diabetes, smoking, symptom duration (group I, <12 months; group II, >=12 months), tear size according to the Kim classification (group I, A and B; group II, C; group III, D), tendon involvement (group I, supraspinatus; group II, supraspinatus and subscapularis; group III, supraspinatus and infraspinatus; group IV, all 3 tendons), and degree of fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus (group I, Goutallier stages 1 and 2 for each tendon; group II, Goutallier stages 3 and 4 for each tendon). RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-two patients underwent arthroscopic repairs of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. The overall retear rate was 13.1%. Age, sex, diabetes, smoking, and degree of fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus did not affect retear rates. However, symptom duration (P = .006), Kim classification (P < .001), and tendon involvement (P < .001) did affect retear rates. The retear rates were 8.5% (14 of 165 patients) and 19.7% (23 of 117) in symptom duration groups I and II, respectively; 8.0% (13 of 163), 15.2% (16 of 105), and 57.1% (8 of 14) in Kim classification groups I, II, and III, respectively; and 6.6% (11 of 167), 22.2% (18 of 81), 10.0% (2 of 20), and 42.9% (6 of 14) in tendon involvement groups I, II, III, and IV, respectively. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the respective odds ratios of symptom duration group II, Kim classification group III, tendon involvement group II, and tendon involvement group IV were 2.853 (P = .011), 18.108 (P = .001), 4.184 (P = .001), and 5.727 (P = .021), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To preoperatively predict retears after arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, the duration of symptoms before surgery, tear size, and tendon involvement can be used. In addition, regarding tear size, the Kim classification can be used more effectively than the modified DeOrio and Cofield classification. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, prognostic case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no known studies that have investigated the effect on delaminated rotator cuff tears of bursal layer-only repair when full-thickness repair would put the articular layer under tension, compared with all-layers repair when full-thickness repair is feasible. HYPOTHESIS: Better outcomes will be seen in the bursal layer-only repair, as the articular layer would be under tension when repaired onto its footprint during the all-layers repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence 3. METHODS: This study included 112 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for posteriorly delaminated tears of either all layers (group A) or the bursal layer alone (group B). If the articular layer was able to be reduced onto its footprint, the patient was assigned to group A; if such reduction was not possible or was only marginally possible under significant tension, the patient was assigned to group B. Pain scored on a visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed, as were subjective shoulder value (SSV), University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and shoulder active range of motion (ROM). Postoperative magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) or computed tomographic arthrography (CTA) was undertaken 6 months postoperatively for structural integrity assessment. RESULTS: After 2 years, the VAS pain score (group A, from 6.5 to 1.2; group B, from 6.4 to 1.2), SSV (group A, from 38.3 to 89.4; group B, from 38.0 to 90.1), ASES score (group A, from 36.4 to 90.4; group B, from 38.0 to 90.8), UCLA shoulder score (group A, from 15.3 to 30.7; group B, from 15.0 to 31.3), and ROM improved significantly in both groups compared with preoperative values (P < .001). However, none of these values differed significantly between groups. On follow-up MRA or CTA images, there was no significant difference in the retear rate between group A (28%; 16/57) and group B (24%; 11/45). CONCLUSION: The all-layers repair did not produce better clinical outcomes or structural integrity than the bursal layer-only repair. The study findings indicate that if repair of the articular layer is possible only under significant tension or is not reparable, rather than all-layers repair by force, bursal-layer repair without incorporating the articular layer may produce comparable clinical outcomes and structural integrity in the delaminated rotator cuff tear.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyse the natural course of symptomatic full-thickness and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears treated non-operatively and to identify risk factors affecting tear enlargement. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two patients who received non-surgical treatment for a partial- or full-thickness supraspinatus tear were included in this study. All rotator cuff tears were diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the same modality was used for follow-up studies. Follow-up MRI was performed after at least a 6-month interval. We evaluated the correlation between tear enlargement and follow-up duration. Eleven risk factors were analysed by both univariate and multivariate analyses to identify factors that affect enlargement of rotator cuff tears. The mean follow-up period was 24.4 +/- 19.5 months. RESULTS: Out of 122 patients, 34 (27.9%) patients had an initial full-thickness tear and 88 (72.1%) patients had a partial-thickness tear. Considering all patients together, tear size increased in 51/122 (41.8%) patients, was unchanged in 65/122 (53.3%) patients, and decreased in 6/122 (4.9%) patients. Tear size increased for 28/34 (82.4%) patients with full-thickness tears and 23/88 (26.1%) patients with partial-thickness tears. From the two groups which were followed over 12 months, a higher rate of enlargement was observed in full-thickness tears than in partial-thickness tears (6-12 months, n.s.; 12-24 months, P = 0.002; over 24 months, P < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that having a full-thickness tear was the most reliable risk factor for tear progression (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that 28/34 (82.4%) of symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears and 23/88 (26.1%) of symptomatic partial-thickness tears increased in size over a follow-up period of 6-100 months. Full-thickness tears showed a higher rate of enlargement than partial-thickness tears regardless of the follow-up duration. Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that full-thickness tear was the most reliable risk factor for tear enlargement. The clinical relevance of these observations is that full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated conservatively should be monitored more carefully for progression than partial-thickness tears. Level of evidence: Iv.

AB  - Background This study (1) compared clinical outcomes and tissue healing between delaminated and nondelaminated rotator tear after repair and (2) evaluated clinical results according to the degree of tissue healing. Materials and methods Ninety-five patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were divided into delaminated tear and nondelaminated tear groups. Tissue healing was evaluated using computed tomography arthrogram and classified into anatomic healing, partially healed defect, and retear. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Assessment score and Constant score were evaluated to quantify the clinical results. Results The mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Constant scores at final follow-up were 82+/-10 and 77+/-7 in the delaminated tear group and 83+/-12 and 75+/-9 in the nondelaminated tear group, respectively. There was no statistical difference (P=.13 and P=.17, respectively). Anatomic healing was most common in both groups. A partially healed defect was the second most common in the delaminated tear group (20 [40.8%]) and retear was the second most common in the nondelaminated tear group (11 [23.9%]; P=.04). Clinical scores showed a statistically significant difference according to tissue healing. Conclusions A delaminated tear showed no difference in the clinical outcome but a difference in tissue healing compared with a non-delaminated tear. Although clinical scores showed a difference according to tissue healing, a higher partially healing defect and lower retear compared with a nondelaminated tear may imply that a delaminated tear may not be a poor prognostic factor after repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based tissue engineering approach has been developed to improve the treatment of rotator cuff tears. Hypothesis/Purpose: The purpose was to determine the effect of an injection of adipose-derived MSCs loaded in fibrin glue during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair on clinical outcomes and to evaluate its effect on structural integrity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The hypothesis was that the application of adipose-derived MSCs would improve outcomes after the surgical repair of a rotator cuff tear. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Among 182 patients treated with arthroscopic surgery for a rotator cuff tear, 35 patients treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair alone (conventional group) were matched with 35 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with an injection of adipose-derived MSCs loaded in fibrin glue (injection group) based on sex, age, and lesion size. Outcomes were assessed with respect to the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, range of motion (ROM) (including forward flexion, external rotation at the side, and internal rotation at the back), and functional measures of the Constant score and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale. Repaired tendon structural integrity was assessed by using MRI at a minimum of 12 months after surgery, and the mean clinical follow-up was 28.8 +/- 4.2 months in the conventional group and 28.3 +/- 3.8 months in the injection group. RESULTS: The mean VAS score at rest and during motion improved significantly in both groups after surgery. However, there were no significant differences between the groups at the final follow-up ( P = .256 and .776, respectively). Compared with preoperative measurements, forward flexion and external rotation at the side significantly improved at the final follow-up in both groups (all P < .05). However, no significant improvements in internal rotation at the back were observed in either group ( P = .625 and .834 for the conventional and injection groups, respectively). There were also no significant differences between the groups at the final follow-up for any of the 3 ROM positions (all P > .05). The mean Constant score and UCLA score improved significantly in both groups after surgery, but there were no significant differences between the groups at the final follow-up ( P = .634 and .302, respectively). MRI indicated a retear rate of 28.5% in the conventional group and 14.3% in the injection group ( P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that an injection of adipose-derived MSCs loaded in fibrin glue during rotator cuff repair could significantly improve structural outcomes in terms of the retear rate. There were, however, no clinical differences in the 28-month period of follow-up. Although still in the early stages of application, MSC augmentation of surgical rotator cuff repair appears useful for providing an adequate biological environment around the repair site.

AB  - PURPOSE: Few studies have examined whether concomitant coracoplasty is necessary to improve clinical and radiological outcomes after arthroscopic subscapularis repair. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes and structural integrity after arthroscopic repair of isolated subscapularis full-thickness tear, either with or without concomitant coracoplasty. METHODS: This study included 62 patients who underwent arthroscopic subscapularis repair either with coracoplasty (Group A, 35 patients) or without coracoplasty (Group B, 27 patients). Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale pain scores, subjective shoulder values, University of California at Los Angeles shoulder scores, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon scores, subscapularis strength, and shoulder active range of motion (ROM) were assessed. Postoperative magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) or computed tomographic arthrography (CTA) was performed 6 months postoperatively for structural integrity assessment. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, all functional scores and ROM improved significantly in both groups compared with preoperative values (p < 0.001). However, none of these values differed significantly between groups. On follow-up MRA or CTA images, although postoperative coracohumeral distance was significantly greater in Group A (8.4 mm +/- 2.3 mm versus 7.0 mm +/- 2.0 mm) (p = 0.018), the re-tear rates were not significantly different between groups (5/35 (14%) in Group A and 4/27 (15%) in Group B). CONCLUSIONS: For isolated subscapularis full-thickness tears, concomitant coracoplasty with arthroscopic repair did not produce better clinical outcomes or structural integrity than repair without coracoplasty. This suggests that concomitant coracoplasty may not be imperative during arthroscopic repair of isolated subscapularis full-thickness tears. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the characteristic findings of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the clinical and radiologic outcomes of interstitial tear of the rotator cuff treated with arthroscopic repair after tear completion. METHODS: Forty-one patients (14 men and 27 women; mean age, 56.5 years) with arthroscopically confirmed interstitial tears underwent single-row repair after tear completion. The minimum follow-up period was 2 years. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (68.3%) were properly evaluated with MRI before surgery. Seven cases (17.1%) were misdiagnosed as bursal-sided tears and 5 cases (12.2%) were misdiagnosed as articular-sided tears on the basis of presurgical MRI findings. Arthroscopy revealed fibrillation and dimpling of the tendon surface in all cases and congestion within the defect in 36 cases (87.8%). At the final follow-up, the visual analog scale score for pain during motion decreased to 0.8 from a preoperative mean of 6.1 (P <.001). Moreover, at the final follow-up, the mean University of California-Los Angeles score and Constant score improved from 15.7 and 51.8 to 32.1 and 83.8, respectively (P <.001 for all). At 9 months after surgery, MRI revealed no cases of retear. CONCLUSION: Interstitial tears are difficult to diagnose before surgery because MRI findings may lead to the misdiagnosis of interstitial tears as articular- or bursal-sided tears. If MRI-based diagnosis is indicative of articular- or bursal-sided tears but arthroscopy reveals fibrillation and dimpling of the tendon surface, interstitial tears should be suspected. The defective sites in interstitial tears are usually accompanied by congestion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We wished to identify the preoperative prognostic factors associated with structural integrity after repair of medium-sized and larger rotator cuff tears and to determine the cutoff values using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. METHODS: The study included 180 patients with medium-sized and larger rotator cuff tears. Each had a minimum 2-year postoperative follow-up by magnetic resonance imaging. We assessed several patient-related and disease-related preoperative factors using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. To determine the cutoff value for the significant variables, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed. RESULTS: Retears occurred in 28 of the 180 patients (15.6%). Univariate analysis found that retear was significantly affected by the type of work and pattern of tear. The rate of retear was significantly increased in diabetes and with increasing tear size, extent of retraction, delamination, and fatty infiltration. Furthermore, reduced remnant tendon length, distance from the musculotendinous junction to the face of the glenoid, occupation ratio, and acromiohumeral interval were also significant risk factors. In the multivariate analysis, body mass index, diabetes, dyslipidemia, extent of retraction, delamination, distance from musculotendinous junction to face of glenoid, occupation ratio, fatty infiltration of infraspinatus, and acromiohumeral interval remained significant risk factors. The extent of retraction (22.2 mm) and the occupation ratio (53.5%) showed highly accurate cutoff values for predicting retear. CONCLUSION: Multiple factors influenced the healing process after rotator cuff repair. The best predictors were the extent of retraction and occupation ratio, which could help assist in determining the prognosis after rotator cuff repairs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have reported on the radiological characteristics and repair integrity of coexistent rotator cuff tears (RCTs) and shoulder stiffness after simultaneous arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and capsular release. PURPOSE: To evaluate the radiological characteristics and repair integrity of 1-stage arthroscopic surgery of RCTs concomitant with shoulder stiffness. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Among patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of full-thickness RCTs, the stiff group underwent simultaneous capsular release for shoulder stiffness, and the nonstiff group had no stiffness. Symptom duration, prevalence of diabetes, tear size, tendon involvement (type 1, supraspinatus; type 2, supraspinatus and subscapularis; and type 3, supraspinatus and infraspinatus; type 4, supraspinatus, subscapularis, and infraspinatus), and fatty infiltration (Goutallier stages 0-4) were evaluated. A retear was appraised using magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical outcomes were assessed using range of motion, the Korean Shoulder Scoring System (KSS), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score. RESULTS: The stiff group showed a significantly lower retear rate (1/39, 2.6%) than the nonstiff group (47/320, 14.7%) ( P = .043). There were significant differences in symptom duration (7.4 +/- 6.6 vs 15.0 +/- 23.7 months, respectively; P < .001), mediolateral tear size (18.9 +/- 8.9 vs 24.1 +/- 12.0 mm, respectively; P = .002), tendon involvement (94.9%, 5.1%, 0.0%, and 0.0% vs 85.3%, 6.9%, 7.8%, and 0.0%, respectively; P = .048), and fatty infiltration of the subscapularis (66.7%, 33.3%, 0.0%, 0.0%, and 0.0% vs 31.9%, 61.3%, 5.6%, 1.3%, and 0.0%, respectively; P < .001) and teres minor (74.4%, 20.5%, 5.1%, 0.0%, and 0.0% vs 47.2%, 48.8%, 3.8%, 0.0%, and 0.3%, respectively; P = .007) between the stiff and nonstiff groups. Preoperatively, the stiff group showed significantly worse forward flexion (95.9degree +/- 23.6degree vs 147.7degree +/- 4.2degree, respectively; P < .001), external rotation (17.4degree +/- 10.1degree vs 51.6degree +/- 12.1degree, respectively; P < .001), and internal rotation (L5 vs L2, respectively; P < .001) and lower KSS (52.1 +/- 13.8 vs 66.3 +/- 13.5, respectively; P < .001) and UCLA scores (18.7 +/- 4.8 vs 22.5 +/- 4.5, respectively; P < .001) than the nonstiff group. However, these differences became insignificant from 3 months postoperatively for forward flexion ( P > .05) and KSS ( P > .05) and UCLA scores ( P > .05), from 1 year postoperatively for external rotation ( P > .05), and at the last follow-up for internal rotation ( P > .05). A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that only mediolateral tear size (odds ratio, 1.043; P = .014) and type 2 tendon involvement (odds ratio, 4.493; P = .003) were independent predictors of a retear. CONCLUSION: RCTs concomitant with shoulder stiffness showed a smaller mediolateral tear size, anterosuperior tendon involvement, and less severe fatty infiltration preoperatively and better repair integrity postoperatively than RCTs without stiffness. Furthermore, the clinical outcomes and range of motion at final follow-up were similar between the 2 groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shoulder stiffness is a common complication after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. However, there is no consensus on the treatment of stiffness after repair. Although one treatment option is an intra-articular steroid injection, it may negatively affect repair integrity, and there is a paucity of literature regarding the timing of intra-articular injections for stiffness after repair and its effect on repair integrity. PURPOSE: To compare repair integrity and clinical outcomes after an intra-articular steroid injection administered at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively for shoulder stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Patients who developed stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were given a series of 3 intra-articular steroid injections every 4 weeks from 6 (6-week group) and 12 weeks (12-week group) postoperatively. The control group had rotator cuff tears but neither stiffness nor injections. Shoulder range of motion (ROM), the Korean Shoulder Scoring System (KSS) score, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score were assessed preoperatively with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Repair integrity was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Seventy-four of 209 patients (35.4%) who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair developed stiffness. There were no significant differences in retear rates among the 6-week (5.7%, 2/35 patients), 12-week (10.3%, 4/39 patients), and control groups (14.1%, 19/135 patients) ( P = .374). Both the 6- and 12-week groups showed significant improvement in ROM (both P < .001), KSS scores (both P < .001), and UCLA scores (both P < .001) at the final follow-up. The 6-week group showed significantly better ROM ( P < .001), KSS scores ( P < .001), and UCLA scores ( P < .001) than the 12-week group at 3 months postoperatively. However, both the 6- and 12-week groups showed significantly lower KSS (81.3 +/- 12.0 [ P = .004] and 83.4 +/- 8.6 [ P = .035], respectively) and UCLA (29.3 +/- 4.6 [ P = .006] and 30.0 +/- 3.3 [ P = .042], respectively) scores than the control group (90.4 +/- 13.6 and 32.3 +/- 4.7, respectively) at the last follow-up. CONCLUSION: An intra-articular steroid injection administered at 6 weeks postoperatively for shoulder stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair may be effective for reducing patients' pain and improving shoulder ROM at 3 months postoperatively without compromising repair integrity.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study compared the functional outcome and repair integrity of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair according to articular-side repair state in full-thickness tears. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 80 consecutive patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears of 1.5-3.5 cm at the anterior to posterior dimension. These patients were divided into two groups according to intraoperative articular-side repair state during operation: complete and incomplete repair groups. Repair integrity was evaluated at 6 months after the operation by magnetic resonance image or ultrasonography. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at 1 year and 2 years postoperatively. Four outcome measures were used in this study: visual analog scale pain score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the Shoulder Rating Scale of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and range of motion. RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, the average UCLA, ASES, and constant score improved significantly to 32.46, 87.94, and 79.69, respectively, in the complete group and to 32.50, 87.65, and 78.92, respectively, in the incomplete group. The UCLA, ASES, and constant score improved in both groups postoperatively (all ps < 0.000); however, there was no significant difference between the two groups ( p = 0.960, 0.921, and 0.796, respectively). The re-tear rate was 13.7% in the shoulders that underwent complete repair and 33.3% in the shoulders that underwent incomplete repair; this difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.041). CONCLUSION: Regardless of the repair state of articular-side rotator cuff, the arthroscopic rotator cuff repair resulted in comparable functional outcomes between two groups at short-term follow-up. However, patients who repaired articular-side rotator cuff incompletely revealed higher re-tear rate after operation than those who repaired completely.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been few studies comparing clinical and radiological outcomes between the conventional and knotless suture-bridge techniques. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the functional outcomes and repair integrity of arthroscopic conventional and knotless suture-bridge technique for full-thickness rotator cuff tears. METHODS: We prospectively followed 100 consecutive patients (100 shoulders) with full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated with the arthroscopic conventional or knotless suture-bridge technique from October 2012 to July 2014. Enrolled patients returned for follow-up functional evaluations at 1 and 2 years after the operation. There were four outcome measures in this study: American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, Shoulder Rating Scale of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) scores, Constant scores, and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores. Enrolled patients returned for follow-up magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography evaluation to confirm the integrity of the repaired cuff at 6 months post-operation (97% follow-up rate). Also, we investigated the preoperative cuff retraction of enrolled patients using preoperative MRI to find out correlation between the stage of cuff retraction and re-tear rate. RESULTS: At final follow-up, the average UCLA, ASES, Constant, and VAS scores had improved significantly to 32.5, 88.0, 80.4, and 1.3, respectively, in the conventional suture-bridge technique group and to 33.0, 89.7, 81.2, and 1.2, respectively, in the knotless suture-bridge technique group. The UCLA, ASES, Constant, and VAS scores improved in both groups after surgery (all p < 0.001), and there were no significant differences between the two groups at 2-year follow-up (p = 0.292, 0.359, 0.709, and 0.636, respectively). The re-tear rate of repaired rotator cuffs was 16.3% (8/49 shoulders) in the conventional suture-bridge technique group and 29.2% (14/48 shoulders) in the knotless suture-bridge technique group; this difference was not significant (p = 0.131). There were no significant differences between the re-tear rate of the two groups in the Patte stage I and II (p = 0.358 and 0.616). CONCLUSIONS: The knotless suture-bridge technique showed comparable functional outcomes to those of conventional suture-bridge techniques in medium-to-large, full-thickness rotator cuff tears at short-term follow-up. The knotless suture-bridge technique had a higher re-tear rate compared with conventional suture-bridge technique, although the difference was not significant.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical outcomes and repair integrity after en masse transosseous-equivalent suture bridge repair for delaminated rotator cuff tears and to analyze the morphologic factors related to clinical outcomes and repair integrity. METHODS: This study included 99 patients who underwent the technique of en masse transosseous-equivalent suture bridge repair for delaminated rotator cuff tears. Morphologic factors were estimated using magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using the University of California, Los Angeles score; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score; and Constant shoulder score. The morphologic factors included the shape of delamination, retraction length of the bursal and articular layers, gap distance between the layers, and length of the intrasubstance cleavage. According to follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, cases were categorized into the intact or retear group. The morphologic factors were compared between the 2 groups, including the correlation between the morphologic factors and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Retears occurred in 26 of 99 cases (26%). In both the intact and retear groups, the University of California, Los Angeles, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and Constant scores improved postoperatively (P < .0001). The most common delamination shape was that of a more retracted articular layer in retears. We found no differences in retears in terms of the retraction length of the bursal layer, gap distance, and length of the intrasubstance cleavage. However, the retraction length of the articular layer differed significantly between the groups (P < .0001). No correlation between the morphologic factors and clinical outcomes was found. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic en masse transosseous-equivalent suture bridge repair is a useful technique in delaminated tears to achieve optimal repair outcomes. In addition, although there was no correlation between the morphologic factors and postoperative clinical outcomes, the retraction length of the articular layer was identified as a significant factor influencing repair integrity. We recommend emphasizing the reduction of tension within the articular layer during the repair procedure. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparison study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical and structural outcomes of arthroscopic side-to-side repair of large U-shaped full-thickness rotator cuff tears (FTRCTs) by assessing the functional score of the patients and the integrity of the tendon repair using magnetic resonance imaging with a minimum follow-up duration of 2 years. METHODS: In this case series, 59 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic side-to-side repair of large U-shaped FTRCTs, with a minimum follow-up duration of 2 years (range 25 to 72 months), were retrospectively enrolled. The mean patient age was 58.6 years. Patients' functional scores and integrity of the tendon repairs were evaluated. RESULTS: The mean visual analog scale score improved from 5.7 +/- 2.1 preoperatively to 2.4 +/- 1.3 postoperatively (P < .001). The mean range of motion (forward flexion) improved from 152.7degree +/- 11.4degree to 164.5degree +/- 9.5degree (P < .001). The mean Constant-Murley score improved from 57.3 +/- 7.2 preoperatively to 77.8 +/- 6.9 postoperatively (P < .001). Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging examinations demonstrated cuff integrity with a retear rate of 54.2%. The retear rate of patients who underwent anchor fixation to the medial row (45%) was significantly lower than that of patients who underwent simple side-to-side repair (73.7%) (P = .039). The University of California at Los Angeles shoulder rating and Constant-Murley scores were not significantly different between the healed and retear groups (P = .639 and P = .863, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic side-to-side repair of large U-shaped FTRCTs demonstrated satisfactory clinical outcomes. However, the retear rate was higher than expected when simple side-to-side fixation was performed without footprint fixation. Therefore, medial row fixation is recommended if arthroscopic side-to-side repair is performed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, comparative therapeutic trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One potential advantage of arthroscopic shoulder surgery over open approaches is accelerated recovery; however, the functional recovery period of daily activities for specific movements after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has not yet been reported, to our knowledge. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) After arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, when are patients able to perform low-level and high-level front-of-body motion, low-level and high-level behind-the-back motion, strength-related activities, and sports/leisure activities? (2) How do tear size, arm dominance, and retear affect performance of these activities? (3) When does the UCLA score cross above 80% in each UCLA score component (28 points)? METHODS: A 2-year prospective study of 135 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed (45 in small-sized, 45 in medium-sized, and 45 in large-to-massive-sized groups). The mean age was 60 years. Thirty-one and 104 shoulders were nondominant and dominant shoulders, respectively. Twenty-seven shoulders showed retear on MRI taken 9 months after surgery. We evaluated the functional recovery periods using the questionnaire and the UCLA scores and assessed influencing factors such as tear size, arm dominance, and retear. The patients were asked to fill out a questionnaire at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months after surgery. The questionnaire evaluated front-of-the-body, behind-the-back, general, simple strength-related, and sports/leisure activities. Based on the UCLA evaluation, the functional recovery period was defined as the time required to achieve a score > 80% in each UCLA score component. RESULTS: Patients experienced recovery of low-level and high-level ROM front-of-the-body, high-level ROM behind-the-back, simple strength-related, and sports/leisure activities within 2 +/- 1, 3 +/- 2, 9 +/- 0, 10 +/- 2, and 14 +/- 3 months, respectively, after surgery. Two patients with large-to-massive tears did not gain the recovery of high-level ROM behind-the-back, simple strength-related, and sports/leisure activities. Patients with large-to-massive tears were delayed from some activities compared with patients with small tears (10 +/- 0 versus 7 +/- 1 for washing back, p = 0.010; 11 +/- 0 versus 10 +/- 0 for lifting 5 kg, p = 0.020; 15 +/- 0 versus 13 +/- 0 for sports/leisure). Arm dominance was not associated with functional recovery. Patients with retears, compared with intact healing, had a longer time to return to washing hair (3 +/- 2 versus 3 +/- 1, p = 0.007), combing (4 +/- 3 versus 2 +/- 1, p = 0.002), washing the back (10 +/- 3 versus 8 +/- 3, p = 0.034), and sports/leisure (15 +/- 3 versus 14 +/- 3, p = 0.010). UCLA score in 134 patients reached 28 points, corresponding to the functional recovery period at 6 +/- 3 months. One patient did not reach > 28 points on the UCLA score. CONCLUSIONS: It took patients an average of 14 months to recover their daily motion after surgery. Tear size and retear affected only the recovery period of high-level motion activities and sports/leisure. This study was believed to serve as a guideline to inform patients about functional recovery after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic repair of delaminated rotator cuff tears (RCTs) has shown poor prognoses. Despite the importance of delaminated tears, only a few studies have compared delaminated and nondelaminated tears. PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and structural integrity after en masse arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between delaminated and nondelaminated RCTs and to evaluate whether infraspinatus tendon involvement affects the prognosis for delaminated tears after arthroscopic cuff repair, through use of propensity score matching for precise comparison. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: This study included 180 consecutive patients with medium- or large-sized RCTs who had an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with a minimum 2-year follow-up, of whom 57 and 123 had delaminated tears (group 1) and nondelaminated tears (group 2), respectively. The en masse repair technique using a single-row or transosseous-equivalent double-row suture-bridge technique was used for of all the delaminated cases. Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale pain scores, shoulder active range of motion, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, and Constant scores were assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at least 24 months postoperatively to identify retear of the repaired rotator cuffs. After propensity score matching, 32 cases in both groups were successfully matched, and the clinical and radiological results were analyzed. RESULTS: Before propensity score matching, postoperative clinical outcomes were improved, showing no significant differences between the groups, excluding forward elevation ( P = .011). Groups 1 and 2 had 17 (29.8%) and 11 retear cases (8.9%), respectively ( P < .001). After propensity score matching, only the ASES score (72.5 vs 77.1) showed a significant superiority in group 2 ( P = .038). Propensity-matched groups 1 and 2 had 8 (25.0%) and 2 (6.3%) retear cases, respectively ( P = .034). No significant difference was found in structural integrity depending on whether the RCT included the infraspinatus tendon (IST). The odds ratio for retear of the delaminated tears, including IST, was 5.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-30.0, P = .038). CONCLUSION: Delaminated RCT was a negative prognostic factor of structural integrity after repair and could affect the functional outcome. However, whether IST tear was involved had no effect on the prognosis after repair.

AB  - Background: Since the establishment of biological augmentation to improve the treatment of rotator cuff tears, it is imperative to explore newer techniques to reduce the retear rate and improve long-term shoulder function after rotator cuff repair. This study was undertaken to determine the consequences of a gel-type atelocollagen injection during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair on clinical outcomes, and evaluate its effect on structural integrity. Methods: Between January 2014 and June 2015, 121 patients with full thickness rotator cuff tears underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Of these, 61 patients were subjected to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in combination with an atelocollagen injection (group I), and 60 patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair alone (group II). The visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and the Korean Shoulder Society (KSS) scores were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 6 months postoperatively, to assess the integrity of the repair. Results: VAS scores were significantly lower in group I than in group II at 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery. KSS scores showed no significant difference between groups in the 24 months period of follow-up. No significant difference was obtained in the healing rate of the rotator cuff tear at 6 months postoperatively (p=0.529). Conclusions: Although a gel-type atelocollagen injection results in reduced pain in patients at 2 weeks after surgery, our study does not substantiate the administration of atelocollagen during rotator cuff repair to improve the clinical outcomes and healing of the rotator cuff.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), and patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) are emerging criteria for patient-based treatment assessments. However, few studies have investigated these measures after rotator cuff repair. PURPOSE: (1) To determine MCID, SCB, and PASS values for pain visual analog scale (pVAS), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. (2) To determine factors for achieving the MCID, SCB, and PASS. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: We analyzed prospectively collected data from a rotator cuff surgery registry between March 2018 and February 2019. Eighty-two patients were included, and anchor questions for deriving MCID, SCB, and PASS values were applied at 1-year follow-up after the surgery. The MCID and SCB for the pVAS, ASES, SANE, and UCLA scores were then derived via 2 methods: a sensitivity- and specificity-based approach, which was used alone to derive PASS values, and a between-patients approach. Additionally, univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors for achieving the MCID, SCB, and PASS. RESULTS: All 4 scores showed acceptable areas under the curve. MCID, SCB, and PASS values for the pVAS were 1.5, 2.5, and 1.7; for ASES scores, 21.0, 26.0, and 78.0; for SANE, 13.0, 20.0, and 71.0; and for UCLA scores, 6.0, 8.0, and 23.0, respectively. Poor preoperative scores demonstrated significantly higher odds ratios (ORs) for achieving the MCID and SCB and lower ORs for achieving the PASS. Retear, large to massive tear, and older age showed lower ORs for achieving the MCID or SCB. For PASS items, male sex and biceps tenodesis had higher ORs, and older age had lower ORs. MCID, SCB, and PASS values per the sensitivity- and specificity-based approach were applied in factor analyses. CONCLUSION: Reliable MCID, SCB, and PASS values were obtained from patient evaluations 1 year after arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery. Poor preoperative score (MCID and SCB), male sex, and biceps tenodesis showed higher ORs, whereas poor preoperative score (PASS), retear, large to massive tear, and older age demonstrated lower ORs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative stiffness after rotator cuff repair is a common complication that can lead to poor outcomes and patient discomfort. The application of an antiadhesive agent at the time of repair recently became an option for clinicians, but little information is available on its effects. PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare retear rates, the incidence of postoperative stiffness, and the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent cuff repair with or without the application of an antiadhesive agent. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Among 296 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery, we compared the outcomes of those injected with a thermosensitive gel antiadhesive agent into the subacromial space (112 cases) versus noninjected controls (184 cases). Retear rates in the 2 groups were determined by magnetic resonance imaging at 1 year after surgery. Shoulder joint range of motion and functional scores were evaluated serially. RESULTS: The rate of retear was significantly lower in the injection group (20/112 cases; 17.9%) than the control group (53/184 cases; 28.8%) (P = .034). Postoperative stiffness was not significantly different between the 2 groups (P = .710). Among the data regarding range of motion, only forward flexion at 6 months after surgery showed superior results in the injection group. Functional scores showed conflicting results: The control group had better visual analog scale scores for pain (injection vs control: 2.17 vs 1.68 at 6 months; 1.82 vs 1.28 at 12 months), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores (79.89 vs 89.64 at 12 months), and simple shoulder test scores (8.70 vs 10.06 at 12 months), whereas the injection group had better Constant-Murley scores (injection vs control: 59.49 vs 55.60 at 3 months; 77.35 vs 71.98 at 6 months; 87.28 vs 81.56 at 12 months). CONCLUSION: The tendon healing rate was significantly higher in the group receiving an antiadhesive agent than in the control group. No intergroup difference was seen in the occurrence of postoperative stiffness. However, the pain-related functional score showed inferior results in the injection group at 12 months. The biological action of antiadhesive agents in rotator cuff repair should be further evaluated.

AB  - PURPOSE: A few studies have focused on factors predisposing to retear after arthroscopic revision rotator cuff repair (ARRCR). This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate (1) the structural and clinical outcomes of ARRCR and (2) pre- and intraoperative factors affecting the integrity of the rotator cuff (RC) tendon by focusing on preoperative RC tendon integrity, tear size, muscle hypotrophy and fatty infiltration. METHODS: Patients who underwent ARRCR between 2006 and 2016 were reviewed. Preoperative variables included demographic data, RC tendon integrity, tear size, and muscle hypotrophy and fatty infiltration on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraoperative variables included repair technique and completeness of repair. The visual analog scale for pain (PVAS), functional VAS (FVAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores, and shoulder range of motion (ROM) were assessed. Postoperative tendon integrity was evaluated using over 6-month follow-up MRI. Patients were classified into groups A (healed) and B (retear), and their variables were compared. RESULTS: Overall 65 patients with a mean follow-up of 49.5 +/- 30.2 (range, 24.0-148.9) months were analyzed. Fifty-six of 65 (86.2%) patients underwent MRI at 9.1 +/- 9.7 (range, 4.4-40.2) months after ARRCR, and 20 of 56 (35.7%) patients (group B) exhibited retear. Group A (36/56, 64.3%) showed higher functional scores and ROMs than group B at the final follow-up, with significant differences in the FVAS scores (Group A versus B: FVAS, 7.6 +/- 1.8 versus 6.4 +/- 1.9, p = 0.036). Intraoperative variables, including preoperative tendon integrity (p = 0.021), tear size (p = 0.007), supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle hypotrophy and fatty infiltration (p < 0.001 and p = 0.046), and completeness of repair (p = 0.030), differed significantly between the groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative supraspinatus muscle hypotrophy and fatty infiltration were independent predisposing factors for retear after ARRCR [odds ratio = 7.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-55.8, p = 0.048]. CONCLUSION: The retear was found in 20/56 patients (35.7%) after ARRCR for less than massive rotator cuff tears in this limited study population. Preoperative tendon integrity, tear size, supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle hypotrophy and fatty infiltration, and completeness of repair was revealed to be associated with tendon integrity following ARRCR. Among them, preoperative supraspinatus muscle atrophy and fatty infiltration were the independent factors for retear after ARRCR, although generalization is limited. Level of evidence: Iv.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to (1) define treatment failure using the referred patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) values for pain visual analog scale (PVAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), and Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) clinical scores and (2) identify the factors that lead to patient dissatisfaction after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). METHODS: We analyzed the arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery registry data from January 2015 to December 2016. Patients were followed for >=2 years and categorized as dissatisfied or satisfied based on our own definition of treatment failure at 2 years postoperatively. For defining treatment failure, the referred PASS values for the PVAS, ASES, and SANE scores were used. Patients who failed to attain the PASS value for the PVAS, ASES, or SANE score were categorized into the dissatisfied group. Pre- and postoperative imaging and basic demographic data were compared between groups. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors affecting patient satisfaction at 2 years after rotator cuff repair. RESULTS: Of 117 patients, 30 (25.6%) were defined as the dissatisfied group (mean follow-up period, 37.5 months). Seventeen patients (14.5%) had confirmed retear on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. In the univariate analysis, sex significantly differed between the groups (female, satisfied vs. dissatisfied groups: 39 [44.8%] vs. 22 [73.3%]; P = .010). Retear alone did not affect patient satisfaction in the univariate analysis (P = .11). Progressed retear size featured a significantly higher risk of patient dissatisfaction (P = .024; odds ratio 6.430, 95% confidence interval 1.270-32.541) in the multivariable analysis using symptom duration, sex, preoperative ASES score, preoperative tear size, retear, and progressed retear size as variables. Moreover, female sex had an increased odds for dissatisfaction (odds ratio 4.646, 95% confidence interval 1.590-13.578; P = .005). CONCLUSION: Two years after ARCR, most patients (74.4%) reported satisfaction with their outcomes. However, satisfaction levels can be altered by female sex or progressed retear size compared with the preoperative state.

AB  - Background: Compared with the single-row technique, the double-row rotator cuff repair technique is known to have a higher load to failure and a lower frequency of gap formation, leading to a lower retear rate. There are some patients with poor clinical outcomes or poor muscle strength without radiologic retear. Purpose/Hypothesis: To assess the postoperative position of suture knots via serial ultrasonography in patients who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with the suture-bridge technique. Our hypothesis was that the suture would pull out of the lateral anchor (suture slippage), changing the positions of the medial suture knots during healing. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: This study included 53 patients (55 shoulders) who underwent arthroscopic suture-bridge repair and were evaluated for a minimum of 24 months. On serial ultrasonography, a straight line was drawn between the top of the greater tuberosity and the medial cortex of the anchor hole. The distances between the knots of the medial rows and the perpendicular line through the center of the anchor hole were measured in longitudinal plane images of the supraspinatus. Follow-up ultrasonography was performed at 2, 3, and 6 months postoperatively as well as at the final visit. The visual analog scale, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, the Constant score, and the University of California, Los Angeles shoulder score were recorded preoperatively and on the final follow-up. Results: Of the 55 shoulders, 6 developed retears at repaired sites. The mean follow-up duration was 37.5 months (range, 24-65 months). Slippage distance increased significantly over time (P < .001). The slippage at the final visit did not differ between patients with retear and no retear (13.4 mm for retear group; 10.6 mm for no retear group [P = .096]). Conclusion: Suture knots of the medial row migrated medially via a suture pullout from the lateral row anchor of suture-bridge technique. Suture slippage distance did not differ significantly between retear and no retear groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Important differences in clinical outcomes likely exist between patients with healed and nonhealed rotator cuff repairs. The survival probability of rotator cuff repairs has not been published in a time-dependent manner up to now. HYPOTHESES: Recurrent tears occur more frequently in the early postoperative period. Early failures of the repair are a prognostic factor for the long-term outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A series of 107 consecutive patients undergoing arthroscopically assisted mini-open repair of the rotator cuff between 1998 and 2002 were evaluated in a prospective study. Of these, 95 patients finished the study after a maximum follow-up of 11 years. The evaluation included 1 postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan as well as multiple ultrasonographies and determinations of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant scores at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly with a median follow-up of 96 months. RESULTS: The overall failure rate was 33% (35 of 107). The survivorship analysis revealed that 74% of all failures occurred atraumatically in the first 3 months and 11% occurred between the third and the sixth month after the repair. The remaining reruptures (14%) happened 2 to 5 years postoperatively and were related to sports activities or direct trauma. The overall clinical results did not deteriorate over time. The parameters healed tendon, rerupture of less than 2 cm(2), and rerupture of more than 2 cm(2) at 6 months were predictors of the gender- and age-adjusted (normalized) Constant score at 84 months (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: The majority of recurrent tears occurred in the first 3 months after surgical repair. The parameters "recurrent tear" as well as "healed tendon" evaluated at 6 months postoperatively appear to be predictors for the clinical outcomes at 7 years. Efforts to improve healing during the initial 3 months have long-term implications for maintenance of cuff integrity and clinical outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the massive cuff stitch (MCS) with the simple stitch in terms of integrity at 2 years after surgery when used to repair small-sized to medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Seventy-one patients underwent arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears between December 2004 and June 2006. The tear sizes ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 cm. The mean patient age was 53 years (range, 40 to 69 years), and the mean follow-up time was 33 months (range, 24 to 41 months). Group I (n = 35) underwent MCS repair, and group II (n = 36) underwent simple stitch repair. Results were analyzed by use of the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Mann-Whitney test. Follow-up ultrasound was performed 24 to 41 months after repair. RESULTS: All patients showed improvements in the visual analog scale for pain, activities of daily living, and University of California, Los Angeles scores (P < .05), but there were no significant differences in scores between groups (P > .05). The satisfaction rating was similar for group I (4.7) and group II (4.3) (P > .05). The failure (retear) rate was significantly lower in group I (14.3%) than in group II (27.8%) (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcomes between the MCS and simple stitch were not significantly different, but the MCS was superior to the simple stitch in maintaining repair integrity on ultrasound evaluation after arthroscopic repair of small-sized to medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, prospective therapeutic comparative study.

AB  - Background: Until now, few studies had investigated the neuropathic pain component in patients with a rotator cuff tear (RCT). Objective(s): The aim of the study was to identify the neuropathic pain component in patients with RCT and to determine the factors correlated with neuropathic pain in patients with RCT. Study Design: Prospective, cohort, prognostic study. Setting(s): Study patients who required arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were analyzed in a hospital setting. Method(s): We prospectively studied 101 patients who were less than 60 years old with full-thickness tears requiring arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify variables that independently affected neuropathic pain in patients with a RCT. We use Douleur neuropathique 4 questionnaire (DN4) to assess neuropathic pain, which was >= 4 points of the DN4 questionaire. The visual analog scale (VAS) for the most severe pain within 4 weeks before admission and mean pain level during the last 4 weeks were checked. The atrophy grades of the rotator cuff muscles were classified on magnetic resonance images according to the Goutallier classification. The size and medial retraction of the RCT were measured during arthroscopic repair for RCT. Result(s): Sixteen (15.8%) of the 101 patients had neuropathic pain according to the cutoff values on the DN4 questionnaire for diagnosing neuropathic pain. The neuropathic pain group had significantly higher prevalence of smoking (P = 0.042), more mean VAS during last 4 weeks (P = 0.008), larger cuff tear (P = 0.003), more medial retraction of cuff (P = 0.016), and severe fatty degeneration of rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, P < 0.001; subscapularis, P < 0.001; and infraspinatus, P = 0.003) than the nonneuropathic pain group. The multiple logistic regression analyses showed that more mean VAS during the last 4 weeks and tear size of a rotator cuff were independent of other factors for the neuropathic pain of the patients with a full-thickness RCT. Limitation(s): Small sample size is the first limitation of this study. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of neuropathic pain in patients with a full-thickness RCT requiring arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was 15.8 % according to the DN4 questionnaire. The neuropathic pain component was more relevant to the severity of pain and tear size in the patients with a full-thickness RCT. It is important to be aware of the existence of neuropathic pain when treating a patient presenting with pain due to a RCT because accompanying neuropathy with a RCT could have a worse effect on repair of a RCT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that rotator cuff tendon (RCT) retears occur early after surgery and ultimate failure strength is reached at between 3 and 6 months. However, few clinical studies have been reported to support their theory. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the RCT integrity after repair showed any difference at 6 months and at 19 months postoperatively. METHODS: Thirty-one patients who underwent complete repair for full-thickness RCT tears that were medium-sized tears or larger and had 2 postoperative follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were included in this study. Retear, fatty degeneration, and muscle atrophy were evaluated during the first and second MRI sessions. Clinical assessment was performed by use of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score, and pain visual analog scale preoperatively and at the time of the first and second MRI scans. RESULTS: The mean time for the two consecutive MRI scans was 5.9 months (range, 3.1-8.3 months) and 19.7 months (range, 10.1-24.3 months). On the first MRI scans, 24 patients had no retear, 5 had partial retears, and 2 had full-thickness retears. In terms of rotator cuff retears, the 2 sets of MRI scans showed exactly the same statuses. The only statistically significant improvement was a reduction in tendinosis on the second MRI scans. In addition, significant improvements in clinical status were observed between the 2 periods. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the structural status of RCTs after arthroscopic repair can be assessed at 6 months after surgery. Furthermore, although functional status improved with time after 6 months, the structural status of repaired cuffs remained unchanged.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the goals of rotator cuff repair is to restore the torn tendon to its original insertion anatomically. However, it is sometimes difficult to restore the entire footprint. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the variables affecting this repair coverage and to discern the differences in retear rate and clinical results between complete and incomplete footprint coverage in rotator cuff surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: From 2007 to 2009, a total of 85 consecutive repairs for medium-to-large rotator cuff tears were identified as having complete or incomplete coverage of their original footprints. We defined the complete footprint coverage (CC) group as patients who had >50% of their footprint covered during repair and the incomplete (IC) group as <50% of their footprint. Factors affecting the amount of footprint coverage were evaluated, and multivariable analysis was conducted to identify independent factors. To assess the final outcome according to the amount of footprint coverage, retear and clinical outcomes were compared between the CC and IC groups. RESULTS: Fifty-seven repairs were defined in the CC group and 28 repairs in the IC group. Preoperatively, age, tear size in coronal oblique and sagittal oblique planes, Goutallier fatty infiltration, and atrophy of the supraspinatus affected the amount of footprint coverage in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis, however, tear size in the coronal plane was the only independent factor affecting footprint coverage in rotator cuff repair. On postoperative MRI, 45.6% of the CC group had an intact tendon, 45.6% had a delaminated partial retear, and 8.8% had a full-thickness retear; in the IC group, 17.9% had an intact tendon, 60.7% had a delaminated partial retear, and 21.4% had a full-thickness retear. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of tendon integrity between groups (P = .028). Clinical scores and range of motion at final follow-up showed no difference between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Tear size in the coronal plane was the only independent factor affecting the amount of footprint coverage. Repair quality based on retear classification was different between the 2 groups. However, both complete and incomplete footprint coverage in rotator cuff repair showed no differences in clinical scores and range of motion at short-term follow-up.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the benefits of a modified rehabilitation protocol (incorporating early closed-chain overhead stretching) in reducing the risk of postoperative stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: During a 17-month period, we performed primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in 152 patients. After surgery, patients with risk factors identified in the previous study (calcific tendonitis, adhesive capsulitis, PASTA [partial articular surface tendon avulsion]-type rotator cuff repair, concomitant labral repair, or single-tendon cuff repair) were enrolled in a modified rehabilitation protocol that added early overhead closed-chain passive motion exercises to our standard protocol; alternatively, patients without risk factors received a standard conservative rehabilitation program. Historical controls were used and comprised patients in the senior author's practice who all received the conservative rehabilitation protocol. The prevalence of postoperative stiffness was compared between the historical cohort and current study patients by use of Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Among the 152 patients studied, 79 were positive for at least 1 of the specified risk factors and received the modified protocol. Postoperative stiffness developed in none of the 79 patients enrolled in the modified program. This finding represented a significant improvement (Fisher exact test, P = .004) over the historical controls, in which 18 of the 231 at-risk patients had significant postoperative stiffness develop. CONCLUSIONS: In at-risk patients (with calcific tendonitis, adhesive capsulitis, PASTA repair, concomitant labral repair, and single-tendon repair), a postoperative rehabilitation regimen that incorporates early closed-chain passive overhead motion can reduce the incidence of postoperative stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - PURPOSE: Frozen shoulder is a potential complication after shoulder surgery. It is a clinical condition that is often associated with marked disability and can have a profound effect on the patient's quality of life. The incidence, etiology, pathology and prognostic factors of postoperative frozen shoulder after shoulder surgery are not known. The purpose of this explorative study was to determine the incidence of postoperative frozen shoulder after various operative shoulder procedures. A second aim was to identify prognostic factors for postoperative frozen shoulder after shoulder surgery. METHODS: 505 consecutive patients undergoing elective shoulder surgery were included in this prospective cohort study. Follow-up was 6 months after surgery. A prediction model was developed to identify prognostic factors for postoperative frozen shoulder after shoulder surgery using the TRIPOD guidelines. We nominated five potential predictors: gender, diabetes mellitus, type of physiotherapy, arthroscopic surgery and DASH score. RESULTS: Frozen shoulder was identified in 11% of the patients after shoulder surgery and was more common in females (15%) than in males (8%). Frozen shoulder was encountered after all types of operative procedures. A prediction model based on four variables (diabetes mellitus, specialized shoulder physiotherapy, arthroscopic surgery and DASH score) discriminated reasonably well with an AUC of 0.712. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative frozen shoulder is a serious complication after shoulder surgery, with an incidence of 11%. Four prognostic factors were identified for postoperative frozen shoulder: diabetes mellitus, arthroscopic surgery, specialized shoulder physiotherapy and DASH score. The combination of these four variables provided a prediction rule for postoperative frozen shoulder with reasonable fit. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective cohort study.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Rotator cuff tear is a common degenerative shoulder disorder that often requires surgical treatment. However, the correlation between the size of the tear and the functional results is somewhat controversial, which generates inconsistency among orthopaedic surgeons about the indications for and methods of rotator cuff reconstruction. AIMS: The aim of the authors was to evaluate the midterm functional outcome after rotator cuff reconstruction and the possible connection between the results and the surgical technique or the postoperative ultrasound examination. In addition, recently published corresponding studies are also reviewed by the authors. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with full thickness rotator cuff tear were enrolled into the study who were treated either by arthroscopic (14 patients) or by open repair (13 patients) technique. Functional results were assessed using clinical tests. Ultrasound examination was also performed. RESULTS: The average postoperative Constant Score was 73, the average DASH (Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand score) was 14. The Constant scores averaged 80 for the arthroscopic and 70 for the open group. Ultrasound examination showed partial or full thickness retear of the cuff in 40% of the cases. CONCLUSION: More than 70% of the patients had excellent or good results two years after the reconstruction. The change in the acromiohumeral distance or partial retear failed to affect the results significantly, but full thickness tear had an effect on them.

AB  - Supraspinatus (SSP) tendon tears represent a common indication for shoulder surgery. Yet, prediction of postoperative function and tendon retear remains challenging and primarily relies on morphologic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based parameters, supported by patients' demographic data like age, gender, and comorbidities. Considering continuously high retear rates, especially in patients with larger tears and negative prognostic factors, improved outcome prediction could be of high clinical value. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) enables an assessment of dynamic perfusion of the SSP muscle. As a potential surrogate for muscle vitality, CEUS might reflect functional properties of the SSP and support improved outcome prediction after tendon repair. Fifty patients with isolated SSP tendon tears were prospectively enrolled. Preoperatively, SSP muscle perfusion was quantified by CEUS and conventional morphologic parameters like tear size, fatty infiltration, and tendon retraction were assessed by MRI. At six months follow-up, shoulder function, tendon integrity, and muscle perfusion were reassessed. The predictive value of preoperative CEUS for postoperative shoulder function and tendon integrity was evaluated. 35 patients entered the statistical analysis. Preoperative CEUS-based assessment of SSP perfusion significantly correlated with early postoperative shoulder function (Constant, r = 0.48, p < 0.018) and tendon retear (r = 0.67, p < 0.001). CEUS-based subgroup analysis identified patients with exceptionally high, respectively low risk for tendon retear. CEUS-based assessment of the SSP seemed to predict early shoulder function and tendon retear after SSP repair and allowed to identify patient subgroups with exceptionally high or low risk for tendon retear. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although arthroscopic anchor suturing is commonly used for rotator cuff repair and achieves good results, certain shortcomings remain, including difficulty with reoperation in cases of retear, anchor dislodgement, knot impingement, and financial cost. In 2005, we developed an anchorless technique for arthroscopic transosseous suture rotator cuff repair. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: After acromioplasty and adequate footprint decortication, three K-wires with perforated tips are inserted through the inferior margin of the greater tuberosity into the medial edge of the footprint using a customized aiming guide. After pulling the rotator cuff stump laterally with a grasper, three K-wires are threaded through the rotator cuff and skin. Thereafter, five Number 2 polyester sutures are passed through three bone tunnels using the perforated tips of the K-wires. The surgery is completed by inserting two pairs of mattress sutures and three bridging sutures. METHODS: We investigated the retear rate (based on MR images at least 1 year after the procedure), total score on the UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale, axillary nerve preservation, and issues concerning bone tunnels with this technique in 384 shoulders in 380 patients (174 women [175 shoulders] and 206 men [209 shoulders]). Minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 3.3 years; range, 2-7 years). Complete followup was achieved by 380 patients (384 of 475 [81%] of the procedures performed during the period in question). The remaining 91 patients (91 shoulders) do not have 1-year postsurgical MR images, 2-year UCLA evaluation or intraoperative tear measurement, or they have previous fracture, retear of the rotator cuff, preoperative cervical radiculopathy or axillary nerve palsy, or were lost to followup. RESULTS: Retears occurred in 24 patients (24 shoulders) (6%). The mean overall UCLA score improved from a preoperative mean of 19.1 to a score of 32.7 at last followup (maximum possible score 35, higher scores being better). Postoperative EMG and clinical examination showed no axillary nerve palsies. Bone tunnel-related issues were encountered in only one shoulder. CONCLUSIONS: Our technique has the following advantages: (1) reoperation is easy in patients with retears; (2) surgical materials used are inexpensive polyester sutures; and (3) no knots are tied onto the rotator cuff. This low-cost method achieves a low retear rate and few bone tunnel problems, the mean postoperative UCLA score being comparable to that obtained by using an arthroscopic anchor suture technique.

AB  - Introduction: There is limited medium-term outcome data regarding the predictors of functional outcome and patient satisfaction after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Methods: 287 patients that underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair under a high-volume single surgeon were contacted at a minimum of 4 years following surgery. Patient demographics, tear size and co-morbidities were pre-operatively recorded. The Oxford shoulder score, EuroQol 5-dimensional score and patient satisfaction were recorded at final follow-up. Results: 234 (81.5%) patients completed follow-up at a mean of 5.5 (4–9) years. There were 126 males and 108 females with a mean age of 60 (range 25–83) years. The majority of patients (n = 211, 90%) were satisfied with their final outcome. Multivariate linear regression analysis (R2 = 0.64) identified that increasing tear size (p = 0.04), worsening general health assessed by the EuroQol 5-Dimensional (p &lt; 0.001), and smoking (p = 0.049) were associated with a worse Oxford shoulder score. Logistic regression analysis (R2 = 0.13) identified that worsening general health assessed by the EuroQol 5-Dimensional (p &lt; 0.001), and smoking (p = 0.01) were associated with an increased risk of patient dissatisfaction. Conclusion: General health status and smoking are independent predictors of functional outcome and patient satisfaction at medium-term follow-up following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rate of retears after rotator cuff repair varies from 11% to 94%. A retear is associated with poorer subjective and objective clinical outcomes than intact repair. PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine which preoperative and/or intraoperative factors held the greatest association with retears after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated 1000 consecutive patients who had undergone a primary rotator cuff repair by a single surgeon using an arthroscopic inverted-mattress knotless technique and who had undergone an ultrasound evaluation 6 months after surgery to assess repair integrity. Exclusion criteria included previous rotator cuff repair on the same shoulder, incomplete repair, and repair using a synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene patch. All patients had completed the modified L'Insalata Questionnaire and underwent a clinical examination before surgery. Measurements of tear size, tear thickness, associated shoulder injury, tissue quality, and tendon mobility were recorded intraoperatively. RESULTS: The overall retear rate at 6 months after surgery was 17%. Retears occurred in 27% of full-thickness tears and 5% of partial-thickness tears (P < .0001). The best independent predictors of retears were anteroposterior tear length (correlation coefficient r = 0.41, P < .0001), tear size area (r = 0.40, P < .0001), mediolateral tear length (r = 0.34, P < .0001), tear thickness (r = 0.29, P < .0001), age at surgery (r = 0.27, P < .0001), and operative time (r = 0.18, P < .0001). These factors produced a predictive model for retears: logit P = (0.039 x age at surgery in years) + (0.027 x tear thickness in %) + (1 x anteroposterior tear length in cm) + (0.76 x mediolateral tear length in cm) - (0.17 x tear size area in cm(2)) + (0.018 x operative time in minutes) -9.7. Logit P can be transformed into P, which is the chance of retears at 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: A rotator cuff retear is a multifactorial process with no single preoperative or intraoperative factor being overwhelmingly predictive of it. Nevertheless, rotator cuff tear size (tear dimensions, tear size area, and tear thickness) showed stronger associations with retears at 6 months after surgery than did measures of tissue quality and concomitant shoulder injuries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We retrospectively assessed the clinical outcomes and investigated risk factors influencing retear after arthroscopic suture bridge repair technique for rotator cuff tear through clinical assessment and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA). METHODS: Between January 2008 and April 2011, sixty-two cases of full-thickness rotator cuff tear were treated with arthroscopic suture bridge repair technique and follow-up MRA were performed. The mean age was 56.1 years, and mean follow-up period was 27.4 months. Clinical and functional outcomes were assessed using range of motion, Korean shoulder score, Constant score, and UCLA score. Radiological outcome was evaluated with preoperative and follow-up MRA. Potential predictive factors that influenced cuff retear, such as age, gender, geometric patterns of tear, size of cuff tear, acromioplasty, fatty degeneration, atrophy of cuff muscle, retraction of supraspinatus, involved muscles of cuff and osteolysis around the suture anchor were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty cases (48.4%) revealed retear on MRA. In univariable analysis, retear was significantly more frequent in over 60 years age group (62.5%) than under 60 years age group (39.5%; p = 0.043), and also in medium to large-sized tear than small-sized tear (p = 0.003). There was significant difference in geometric pattern of tear (p = 0.015). In multivariable analysis, only age (p = 0.036) and size of tear (p = 0.030) revealed a significant difference. The mean active range of motion for forward flexion, abduction, external rotation at the side and internal rotation at the side were significantly improved at follow-up (p < 0.05). The mean Korean shoulder score, Constant score, and UCLA score increased significantly at follow-up (p < 0.01). The range of motion, Korean shoulder score, Constant score, and UCLA score did not differ significantly between the groups with retear and intact repairs (p > 0.05). The locations of retear were insertion site in 10 cases (33.3%) and musculotendinous junction in 20 cases (66.7%; p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Suture bridge repair technique for rotator cuff tear showed improved clinical results. Cuff integrity after repair did not affect clinical results. Age of over 60 years and size of cuff tear larger than 1 cm were factors influencing rotator cuff retear after arthroscopic suture bridge repair technique.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate and further determine the incidences of repaired supraspinatus tendons on early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in clinically improving patients and to evaluate interval changes on follow-up MRIs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients, who showed symptomatic and functional improvements after supraspinatus tendon repair surgery and who underwent postoperative MRI twice with a time interval, were included. The first and the second postoperative MRIs were obtained a mean of 4.4 and 11.5 months after surgery, respectively. The signal intensity (SI) patterns of the repaired tendon on T2-weighted images from the first MRI were classified into three types of heterogeneous high SI with fluid-like bright high foci (type I), heterogeneous high SI without fluid-like bright high foci (type II), and heterogeneous or homogeneous low SI (type III). Interval changes in the SI pattern, tendon thickness, and rotator cuff interval thickness between the two postoperative MRIs were evaluated. RESULTS: The SI patterns on the first MRI were type I or II in 45 tendons (90%) and type III in five (10%). SI decreased significantly on the second MRI (p < 0.050). The mean thickness of repaired tendons and rotator cuff intervals also decreased significantly (p < 0.050). CONCLUSION: Repaired supraspinatus tendons exhibited high SI in 90% of clinically improving patients on MRI performed during the early postsurgical period. The increased SI and thickness of the repaired tendon decreased on the later MRI, suggesting a gradual healing process rather than a retear.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes following conservative treatment and arthroscopic repair in patients with a rotator cuff tear. METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients aged >50 years with a symptomatic rotator cuff tear were reviewed. The rotator cuff tendons were evaluated using ultrasonography, shoulder magnetic resonance imaging or MR arthrography, and the patients with either a high-grade partial-thickness or small-to-medium-sized (<=3 cm) full-thickness tear were included in this study. The primary outcome measures were a pain assessment score and range of motion (ROM) at 1-year follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the rate of tear progression or retear along with the rate of symptom aggravation after the treatments. RESULTS: A total of 357 patients were enrolled, including 183 patients that received conservative treatment and 174 patients who received an arthroscopic repair. The pain assessment score (p<0.001) and the ROM in forward flexion (p<0.001) were significantly improved in both groups. The ROM in internal rotation did not significantly change after conservative treatment and arthroscopic repair. The pain assessment score and ROM were not significantly different between the two groups. Retear was observed in 9.6% of patients who had an arthroscopic repair and tear progression was found in 6.7% of those who underwent conservative treatment. The proportion of aggravation for pain and ROM did not significantly differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of conservative treatment is not inferior to arthroscopic repair for patients >50 years old with a less than medium-sized rotator cuff tear in a 1-year follow-up period. Further study is warranted to find the optimal combination of conservative treatment for a symptomatic rotator cuff tear.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare functional outcomes and tendon integrity between the suture bridge and modified tension band techniques for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: A consecutive series of 128 patients who underwent the modified tension band (MTB group; 69 patients) and suture bridge (SB group; 59 patients) techniques were enrolled. The pain visual analogue scale (VAS), Constant, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores were determined preoperatively and at the final follow-up. Rotator cuff hypotrophy was quantified by calculating the occupation ratio (OR). Rotator cuff integrity and the global fatty degeneration index were determined by using magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The average VAS, Constant, and ASES scores improved significantly at the final follow-up in both groups (p < 0.05 for all scores). The retear rate of small-to-medium tears was similar in the modified tension band and suture bridge groups (7.0 vs. 6.8%, respectively; p = n.s.). The retear rate of large-to-massive tears was significantly lower in the suture bridge group than in the modified tension band group (33.3 vs. 70%; p = 0.035). Fatty infiltration (postoperative global fatty degeneration index, p = 0.022) and muscle hypotrophy (postoperative OR, p = 0.038) outcomes were significantly better with the suture bridge technique. CONCLUSION: The retear rate was lower with the suture bridge technique in the case of large-to-massive rotator cuff tears. Additionally, significant improvements in hypotrophy and fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff were obtained with the suture bridge technique, possibly resulting in better anatomical outcomes. The suture bridge technique was a more effective method for the repair of rotator cuff tears of all sizes as compared to the modified tension band technique. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective Cohort Design, Treatment Study, level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A retear is a significant clinical problem after rotator cuff repair. However, no study has evaluated the retear rate with regard to the extent of footprint coverage. PURPOSE: To evaluate the preoperative and intraoperative factors for a retear after rotator cuff repair, and to confirm the relationship with the extent of footprint coverage. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 693 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between January 2006 and December 2014. All repairs were classified into 4 types of completeness of repair according to the amount of footprint coverage at the end of surgery. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after a mean postoperative duration of 5.4 months. Preoperative demographic data, functional scores, range of motion, and global fatty degeneration on preoperative MRI and intraoperative variables including the tear size, completeness of rotator cuff repair, concomitant subscapularis repair, number of suture anchors used, repair technique (single-row or transosseous-equivalent double-row repair), and surgical duration were evaluated. Furthermore, the factors associated with failure using the single-row technique and transosseous-equivalent double-row technique were analyzed separately. RESULTS: The retear rate was 7.22%. Univariate analysis revealed that rotator cuff retears were affected by age; the presence of inflammatory arthritis; the completeness of rotator cuff repair; the initial tear size; the number of suture anchors; mean operative time; functional visual analog scale scores; Simple Shoulder Test findings; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores; and fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed patient age, initial tear size, and fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus as independent risk factors for a rotator cuff retear. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the single-row group revealed patient age and fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus as independent risk factors for a rotator cuff retear. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the transosseous-equivalent double-row group revealed a frozen shoulder as an independent risk factor for a rotator cuff retear. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that patient age, initial tear size, and fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus are independent risk factors for a rotator cuff retear, whereas the completeness of rotator cuff repair based on the extent of footprint coverage and repair technique are not.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of chronically retracted rotator cuff tears by arthroscopic medializing and non-medializing repair (restoring anatomic footprint and performing conventional repair). METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 195 patients who underwent arthroscopic double-row modified Mason-Allen repair for large, full-thickness rotator cuff tears from January 2013 to July 2015. We included a total of 60 of these patients and divided them into 2 groups: those who underwent medialization (n = 24) and those who did not (n = 36). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at a minimum of 6 months (mean, 15.2 months; range, 6-24 months) postoperatively to assess cuff integrity. Patients were clinically evaluated at least 1 year postoperatively (mean, 18.9 months; range, 12-60 months) with a visual analog scale, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, the University of California-Los Angeles Shoulder Rating Scale score, and the Constant score. RESULTS: The mean medialization length was 10.5 mm (range, 6.5-15.6 mm) on magnetic resonance imaging. The retear rate was 8.3% (n = 2) in the medialization group and 31% (n = 11) in the non-medialization group (P = .041). At last follow-up, the mean visual analog scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, University of California-Los Angeles, and Constant scores improved significantly from 5.3 +/- 1.4, 38.5 +/- 8.8, 22.5 +/- 3.1, and 41.7 +/- 9.9, respectively, to 1.8 +/- 1.1, 85.3 +/- 7.5, 31.8 +/- 2.5, and 90.2 +/- 6.9, respectively, with medialization and from 4.0 +/- 1.6, 51.5 +/- 10.5, 20.0 +/- 3.9, and 55.9 +/- 10.5, respectively, to 1.4 +/- 1.0, 88.6 +/- 9.0, 31.0 +/- 9.3, and 89.4 +/- 9.3, respectively, with non-medialization (P < .001), although there were no significant differences between the groups (P = .165, P = .653, P = .250, and P = .113, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Medialization of approximately 10.5 mm reliably shows good clinical results, and medializing rotator cuff tendons should be considered as a treatment option for repairing rotator cuff tears with chronic retracted tendons. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This retrospective study compared the clinical and radiologic outcomes of patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs by the suture-bridge and double-row modified Mason-Allen techniques. METHODS: From January 2012 to May 2013, 76 consecutive cases of full-thickness rotator cuff tear, 1 to 4 cm in the sagittal plane, for which arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was performed, were included. The suture-bridge technique was used in 37 consecutive shoulders; and the double-row modified Mason-Allen technique, in 39 consecutive shoulders. Clinical outcomes at a minimum of 2 years (mean, 35.7 months) were evaluated postoperatively using the visual analog scale; University of California, Los Angeles Shoulder Scale; American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Subjective Shoulder Scale; and Constant score. Postoperative cuff integrity was evaluated at a mean of 17.7 months by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: At the final follow-up, the clinical outcomes improved in both groups (all P < .001) but with no significant differences between the 2 groups (all P > .05). The retear rate was 18.9% in the shoulders subjected to suture-bridge repair and 12.8% in the double-row modified Mason-Allen group; the difference was not significant (P = .361). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of fewer suture anchors, the patients who underwent double-row modified Mason-Allen repair had comparable shoulder functional outcomes and a comparable retear rate with those who underwent suture-bridge repair. Therefore, the double-row modified Mason-Allen repair technique can be considered an effective treatment for patients with medium- to large-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe a new C-shaped tear configuration, and to compare clinical outcomes and structural integrity between the C-shaped and the established crescent-shaped small to medium-sized rotator cuff tears after arthroscopic repair. METHODS: This retrospective study included 102 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair in a single-row fashion for small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tears of either C or crescent shape from March 2009 to June 2014. Visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score, subjective shoulder value (SSV), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) score, and active range of motion (ROM) were evaluated for functional outcomes. Postoperative magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) or computed tomographic arthrography (CTA) was performed 6 months postoperatively to assess structural integrity. RESULTS: After 2 years of follow-up, both groups showed no significant difference in VAS pain score, functional scores, or ROM, although the C-shaped tear group exhibited significantly inferior outcomes 3 months after surgery. There was no significant difference in the re-tear rate on follow-up MRA and CTA between groups A and B (24.4 vs. 19.7%, respectively; p = 0.570). The postoperative stiffness rate was significantly higher in the C-shaped tear group than that in crescent-shaped tear group only at 3-month follow-up point after surgery (26.8 vs. 9.8%, respectively; p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypothesis, there were no significant differences in functional outcomes and structural integrity between C-shaped and crescent-shaped small- to medium-sized tears 2 years after arthroscopic repair. However, C-shaped tears exhibited significantly worse clinical outcomes, including a higher postoperative stiffness rate than crescent-shaped tears in the early postoperative period at the 3-month follow-up point.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare clinical outcomes and structural integrity following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, either with intra-articular injection of corticosteroids in the early postoperative period using ultrasound guidance or without it. METHODS: This study included 318 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair for either a partial-thickness or small-to-medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tear from 2012 to 2015. Patients were divided into two groups based on the administration of an intra-articular corticosteroids injection at 3 months after the surgery: group A (with corticosteroid injection, n = 56) and group B (without corticosteroid injection, n = 262). Functional outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, subjective shoulder value (SSV), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score, and active range of motion (ROM). Postoperative magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) was performed 6 months postoperatively to assess structural integrity. RESULTS: At the 2-year follow-up, both groups showed no significant differences in VAS pain score (group A/B, 1.1 +/- 0.9/1.1 +/- 1.1), functional scores including SSV (88.5 +/- 10.8/88.3 +/- 10.0), ASES (90.8 +/- 6.6/90.4 +/- 6.9), and UCLA scores (30.2 +/- 5.6/30.7 +/- 5.2), and active ROM including forward flexion (151degree +/- 8degree/153degree +/- 7degree), external rotation (54degree +/- 5degree/55degree +/- 7degree), and internal rotation (10 +/- 1/10 +/- 2). Follow-up MRA imaging collected 6 months after surgery showed no significant difference in the re-tear rate (n.s.) between group A and B (n = 10/56, 17.9% and 45/262, 17.2%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular corticosteroids injection in the early postoperative period after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair provided satisfactory pain relief and ROM improvement without increasing the re-tear rate or deteriorating clinical outcomes at the 2-year follow-up. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to evaluate the functional and radiologic outcomes of biocompatible non-absorbable PEEK (polyetheretherketone) and biocomposite (poly-L-lactic acid/poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) 70% + beta-tricalcium phosphate) anchors, especially in terms of perianchor cyst formation during the first six months postoperatively. We prospectively analysed 29 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between March and May 2019. Both PEEK and biocomposite suture anchors were used as lateral anchors in one body. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the shoulder range of motion (ROM), visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and satisfactory score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and Simple Shoulder Test (SST). All these were obtained in patients preoperatively at 3 and 6 months after surgery. The imaging evaluation included perianchor cyst formation, anchor absorption, repaired cuff integrity, and retear pattern. All functional outcomes significantly improved over time. The biocomposite anchor had a statistically significant tendency to form higher grades of fluid collection at 3 months after surgery. However, the perianchor cyst reduced by the sixth postoperative month. Six months postoperatively, the functional outcomes were improved after rotator cuff repair and similar degrees of perianchor cyst formation were observed, regardless of the suture anchor material used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The critical shoulder angle (CSA) is the angle created between the superior and inferior bone margins of the glenoid and the most lateral border of the acromion. A few studies recently investigated the relation between CSA and functional outcomes after rotator cuff repair. However, there is a lack of research investigating the effect of CSA on postoperative tendon integrity after rotator cuff repair. PURPOSE: To assess the effects of the CSA on postoperative tendon integrity after rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: All patients who underwent rotator cuff repair for full-thickness supraspinatus tears by 1 senior surgeon between January 2010 and January 2014 were included in this study. All patients had standardized anteroposterior shoulder radiographs the day before surgery. CSA and acromial index (AI) were measured. AI was derived by measuring the distance from the glenoid plane to the lateral border of the acromion and dividing it by the distance from the glenoid plane to the lateral aspect of the humeral head. Functional scores-including American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder evaluation form, modified University of California at Los Angeles score, Constant-Murley score, and visual analog scale for pain-were used to evaluate shoulder function at a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Meanwhile, magnetic resonance imaging examinations were performed to evaluate rotator cuff integrity according to the Sugaya method and the signal/noise quotient (SNQ) of the rotator cuff tendon. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were included in this study: 42 patients with a single-row repair and 48 with a double-row repair. There was a significant positive correlation between CSA or AI and tendon SNQ. On the basis of CSA, the patients were divided into 2 groups: large CSA (>38degree) and control (CSA <=38degree). At final follow-up, the large CSA group and the control CSA group demonstrated no significant differences in American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, University of California at Los Angeles, Constant, and visual analog scale scores. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the large CSA group had 9 cases of retear, with a significantly higher retear rate than the control group (15% vs 0%, P = .03). Furthermore, the tendon SNQ of the large CSA group was significantly greater than that of the control group. CONCLUSION: CSA did not appear to influence postoperative functional outcomes, while those in the large CSA group had poor tendon integrity after rotator cuff repair. These findings indicate that a large CSA is associated with an increased risk of rotator cuff tendon retear after repair.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess patients with and without postoperative residual pain and to compare clinical function and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance of the repaired supraspinatus tendon between patients with and without pain. METHODS: One-hundred and seventeen patients with supraspinatus tear were included in this study. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for pain were assessed at a follow-up of at least 1 year. Patients with residual shoulder pain were enrolled in the residual pain group (RP group) and patients without pain enrolled in the no pain group (NP group). The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder evaluation form, the modified University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score and the Fudan University Shoulder Score (FUSS) were also used to evaluate shoulder function. MRI examinations were performed to evaluate rotator cuff integrity according to the Sugaya method, and muscular hypotrophy, fatty infiltration, and signal/noise quotient (SNQ) of the rotator cuff tendon. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients had residual pain (RP group) and 82 patients had no pain (NR group). At the final follow-up, there was a significant difference in ASES (92 +/- 8 points vs 76 +/- 10 points; p < 0.001), UCLA (32 +/- 3 points vs 28 +/- 3 points; p < 0.001), FUSS (90 +/- 7 points vs 80 +/- 9 points; p < 0.001) and strength (9 +/- 3 kg vs 6 +/- 2 kg; p < 0.001) between the NP group and the RP group, respectively. Postoperative MRI revealed that there was no significant difference in the retear rate (9.8% vs 8.6%; ns), the muscular hypotrophy (ns), and the fatty infiltration index (0.9 +/- 0.2 vs 0.9 +/- 0.2; ns) between the NP and the RP groups, respectively. The postoperative tendon SNQ of the RP group was significantly higher than that of the NP group (4.6 +/- 2.5 vs 3 +/- 1.7; p < 0.001). There was a significant association between tendon SNQ and VAS for this cohort ([Formula: see text] = 0.29; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Postoperative residual pain is associated with a high MRI signal intensity of the repaired supraspinatus tendon. Since high signal intensity of tendon tissue indicates degenerated tendon tissue quality, it highlighted the necessity of debriding the degenerated rotator cuff tendon tissue. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - Background. The clinical evidence is conflicted on whether platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapies have a positive effect on tendon healing and improved functional outcomes. Purpose. To evaluate the potentials of intraoperative injection PRP on the speed and quality of healing in patients undergoing arthroscopic repair for small to medium rotator cuff tears. Methods. A total of 86 patients scheduled for arthroscopic single-row repair of small to medium rotator cuff tears were assigned to undergo either PRP injection (PRP group) or conventional repair (control group). The PRP group (N=43) consisted of patients who received an intraoperative injection of liquid PRP. The control group (N=43) consisted of patients who did not receive that treatment. The visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain before treatment and at 1, 14 days, 3, 6, and 24 months after surgery were recorded. The clinical outcomes were assessed by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Constant scores before treatment and at 3, 6, and 24 months after surgery and magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound examination at 24 months. Patient satisfaction and retear rate were also assessed. Results. No statistical differences in baseline characteristics such as age, gender, dominant arm, and tear size were observed between the two groups (P>0.05). For the PRP group, the mean operation time was 40.22 minutes, and for the control group, the mean operation time was 36.3 minutes. There was a statistically significant difference (P=0.036). After surgery, all VAS measurements significantly decreased over time until final follow-up in both groups. No significant difference between the 2 groups was found for any VAS pain measurement at any time point except for the VAS at 1 day postoperatively, which was significantly lower in the PRP group (2.39+/-1.03) than that in the control group (3.21+/-1.85) (P=0.014). Analysis of the PRP and control groups demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in UCLA and Constant scores from baseline to the 3-, 6-, and 24-month follow-up assessments (P<0.05). However, no significant intergroup differences were observed in the clinical scores between the three follow-up time points (P>0.05). At the 24-month follow-up, patient satisfaction rates reached 95.65% and 93.48% for the PRP and control groups, respectively. The retear rate of the PRP group (2/43, 4.65%) was lower than that of the control group (6/43, 13.95%). Conclusions. Although the pain at 1 day after surgery and the retear rate in the PRP group were significantly lower than those in the control group, the liquid PRP injection did not promote better clinical outcomes at the 2-year follow-up.

AB  - Backgroud: There is controversy over how to surgically treat symptomatic superior labrum anterior to posterior (SLAP) tears in middle-aged patients with concomitant rotator cuff tears. The aim of the study was to compare the clinical and imaging outcomes of SLAP repair versus biceps tenodesis (BT) each combined with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 35 patients older than 45 years who underwent arthroscopic surgery to manage concomitant SLAP tears and rotator cuff tears. In addition to ARCR, 17 patients underwent SLAP repair, whereas 18 patients underwent BT. Shoulder range of motion (ROM), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant score, and University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score were used for clinical assessment. The integrity of rotator cuff repair and change of superior labrum-biceps complex were evaluated by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results: There was significant improvement in the pain VAS and all functional scores in both groups (p < 0.001) at a mean followup of 29.4 +/- 11.4 months (range, 24-84 months) postoperatively. Shoulder ROM showed significant improvement postoperatively (p < 0.05). No significant difference in outcomes could be found between the 2 groups after surgery. The retear rate of rotator cuff repair on MRI was 11.8% in the SLAP repair group and 11.1% in the BT group. Conclusions: In middle-aged patients with combined SLAP lesions and rotator cuff tears, both SLAP repair and BT can be safe adjuncts to ARCR.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND: Whether learning curve could affect the surgical outcome after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate surgical learning curve for clinical outcome and retear rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs that were performed by the beginner shoulder surgeon. We hypothesized that clinical outcome and retear rate would improve over time with the accumulation of a surgeon's experience. METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 200 consecutive patients who had arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, performed by a single surgeon between 2011 and 2018. We included symptomatic rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus/infraspinatus and/or subscapularis tendon and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging evaluations of repair integrity 6 months after surgery. Surgeon's learning was evaluated with calculation of cumulative retear rate and cumulative summation (CUSUM) analysis. Clinical outcomes and the retear rates were compared between group A (the first-half 100 patients) and group B (the latter-half of 100 patients). RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 21 months (range, 12-55). The overall retear rate was 13% (26 patients). The CUSUM analysis showed that after patient number 97, the curve was maintained below the level of acceptable failure rate, suggesting the competency was obtained consistently. Comparing between groups, retear rate showed significant decrease from 18% in group A to 8% in group B (P = .036). Notably, retear rate in small to medium-sized tears (<3 cm) significantly decreased from 26% (12 of 46 patients) in group A to 2% (1 of 49 patients) in group B (P = .001). However, analysis in large to massive tears (>=3 cm) failed to show difference between groups (30%, 6 of 20, in group A and 25%, 6 of 24, in group B; P = .711). In multivariate analysis, higher fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus muscle (P = .008), more severe muscle atrophy of the teres minor (P = .010), and belonging to group A (P = .011) were associated with retear. CONCLUSION: Clinical outcomes and retear rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs significantly improved during the learning curve period of a beginner shoulder surgeon.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Post-operative stiffness is common after rotator cuff repair, given the difference in susceptibility and severity, the genetic factors may be involved. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Matrix metalloproteinases 3 (MMP-3) were previous found as key cytokines in the pathologies of adhesive capsulitis. The present study aims to investigate whether variants within the IL-6 and MMP-3 gene contributed to post-operative stiffness in a Chinese Han population. METHODS: A total of 188 patients diagnosed with rotator cuff tears treated with mini-open surgery were enrolled in this study, among which 87 patients were diagnosed as post-operative stiffness and the remaining 101 patients as controls. All subjects were genotyped for IL-6 and MMP-3 SNPs. RESULTS: The rs1800796 of IL-6 and rs679620 of MMP-3 were found significantly associated with increased susceptibility and severity of post-operative stiffness. CONCLUSION: The rs1800796 SNP of IL-6 and rs650108 SNP of MMP-3 were associated with increased risk of post-operative stiffness susceptibility and severity. This finding can be used in guiding the rehabilitation procedure after rotator cuff surgery, in another word, those with the genetic susceptibility factors should receive a more radical rehabilitation procedure and those without the susceptibility factors can be more conservative.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff retears after surgical repair are associated with poorer subjective and objectives clinical outcomes than intact repairs. PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to (1) examine the biomechanical differences between rotator cuff repair using No. 2 suture and tape in an ovine model and (2) compare early clinical outcomes between patients who had rotator cuff repair with tape and patients who had repair with No. 2 suture. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study and cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Biomechanical testing of footprint contact pressure and load to failure were conducted with 16 ovine shoulders using a tension band repair technique with 2 different types of sutures (No. 2 suture [FiberWire; Arthrex] and tape [FiberTape; Arthrex]) with the same knotless anchor system. A retrospective study of 150 consecutive patients (tape, n = 50; suture, n = 100) who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a single surgeon with tear size larger than 1.5 x 1 cm was conducted. Ultrasound was used to evaluate the repair integrity at 6 months postsurgery. RESULTS: Rotator cuff repair using tape had greater footprint contact pressure (mean +/- standard error of the mean, 0.33 +/- 0.03 vs 0.11 +/- 0.3 MPa; P < .0001) compared with repair using No. 2 sutures at 0degree abduction with a 30-N load applied across the repaired tendon. The ultimate failure load of the tape repair was greater than that for suture repair (217 +/- 28 vs 144 +/- 14 N; P < .05). The retear rate was similar between the tape (16%; 8/50) and suture groups (17%; 17/100). CONCLUSION: Rotator cuff repair with the wider tape compared with No. 2 suture did not affect the retear rate at 6 months postsurgery, despite having superior biomechanical properties.

AB  - Hypothesis: The purpose was to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes and tendon structural integrity after repair of isolated subscapularis (SSC) tendon tears. Method(s): Sixty-one patients who underwent repair of isolated SSC tears were evaluated. The mean interval from symptom onset to surgery was 5.3 months. Shoulder function was investigated using the Constant score and Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV). Structural integrity of the repair and quality of the repaired tendon were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Independent preoperative factors affecting clinical outcomes, including patient sex, age, smoking habits, injections, dominant shoulder, profession, and tear onset (chronic vs. traumatic), were evaluated. Result(s): A total of 35 patients (9 women and 26 men; mean age, 54 years) were included at the final 10-year follow-up because 21 patients were lost to follow-up and 5 underwent reoperations. The mean Constant score improved from 55.1 points preoperatively to 75.4 points postoperatively (P =.001). The postoperative SSV was 80.9, and the retear rate was 12.9%. Postoperative fatty infiltration increased in 26% of the patients with grades 3-4, but it was not related to lower clinical outcomes. Multivariable regression analysis revealed no correlation among the preoperative factors, including sex, age, smoking habits, injections, dominant shoulder, profession, and tear onset, and the postoperative Constant score, SSV, and tendon healing. Conclusion(s): At a mean of 10 years after repair of isolated SSC tears, clinical results were satisfactory and functional improvement was maintained in the long term. Severe fatty infiltration increased with time, but it was not related to clinical outcomes and the retear rate. Copyright © 2020

AB  - BACKGROUND: Factors affecting a rotator cuff symptomatic retear after arthroscopic repair have yet to be clearly identified, since they usually influence the surgical decisions. METHODS: Consecutive patients with full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus who underwent arthroscopic repair were retrospectively analyzed. Cases of symptomatic retear, defined as Sugaya type IV and V on magnetic resonance imaging, associated with intensive pain and/or functional impairment were identified at follow-up. The patients with no symptomatic retear were selected as the control group. Information from potential risk factors of symptomatic retear, including depression and subacromial corticosteroid injections, was extracted from the medical records. The statistical analysis included multivariant logistic regression. RESULTS: The symptomatic retear rate was 9.5% in 158 patients. Patients in the symptomatic retear group were more likely to be smoking, to have massive tears, a short acromiohumeral distance, and moderate to severe fatty infiltration. They also had had more frequently subacromial corticosteroid injections and depression. However, following the multiple logistic regression analysis, only massive tears and moderate to severe fatty infiltration remained significantly associated. Similarly, in relation to the study hypothesis, both corticosteroid injections (odds ratio [OR] 6.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49, 29.81; P = .013) and depression (OR 8.26, IC 1.04, 65.62; P = .046) were significantly associated with symptomatic retear risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study found support for the hypothesis that both depression and corticosteroid infiltration before surgery are independent risk factors for symptomatic retear after arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple factors including muscle atrophy, fatty infiltration, smoking, advanced patient age, and increasing tear size have been identified as risk factors for retear after rotator cuff repair. However, little is known about what effect the length of the residual rotator cuff tendon has on the success of repair and patient outcomes. METHODS: This study included 64 patients. Patients were stratified based on a residual tendon length of greater than 15 mm (group 1, residual tendon) or 15 mm or less (group 2, no residual tendon). Rotator cuff tendon integrity was then evaluated using ultrasound imaging at 6 months. Outcome measures included the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, visual analog scale score, EQ5D Index score, Global Rating of Change score, and Penn Shoulder Score. RESULTS: No differences were found between groups regarding demographic data or repair configuration. Assessment of tendon healing demonstrated an increased rate of tendons that had "not healed" in group 2 (19.3% [n = 5] vs. 13.2% [n = 5]), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = .55). Functional outcome scores improved significantly from preoperatively to final follow-up in both groups and displayed no differences at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: A smaller residual tendon length was not a negative predictor of clinical outcomes following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in patients with short-term follow-up. Although there was a trend toward a decreased rate of healing in patients with smaller residual tendons, this was not significant.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the results of the surgical repair of the rotator cuff tears and to analyze the correlation among the state of the surgical tendons repaired and the functional results obtained. Patients and methodology: We reviewed 42 shoulders in 39 patients being the average follow-up period 15 months. The mean age was 61. The tears were classified according to tendon retraction and the number of affected tendons. The clinical outcome was evaluated with the Constant and Murley system and the relative Constant score. The integrity of the repair was assessed by ultrasound exam. Result(s): 47% repair failure was observed. The average Constant score for the whole group was 76 being the relative Constant score 93.6%. For those patients with tendon rerupture the mean relative Constant score was 86,7% comparing with the 98,7% which averaged the non-failure group. Out of all the items evaluated, strength was the most affected in the failure group compared to the successful repair group. Conclusion(s): 79% of the patients with reruptures were subjectively satisfied and would let themselves be operated again, leaving us with the idea that surgical repair should be tried even with the risk of a potential suture failure.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was clinical and advanced biomechanical evaluation of shoulder function with respect to rotator cuff (RC) integrity following repair. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 111 cases with solid single row rotator cuff repair and a minimal one-year follow-up. The RC repair was performed as an open procedure in 42 patients, arthroscopically assisted in 34 and fully arthroscopic in 48 cases. Evaluation protocol included ultrasound evaluation of the RC integrity, clinical evaluation using shoulder scores and advanced biomechanical evaluation (isometric and the isokinetic strength testing). RESULTS: Ultrasound evaluation revealed complete retear in 16%, partial retear in 10% and intact repair in 74% of the cases. Isometric testing of flexion and abduction had shown that shoulders with complete retear were weaker by 45% compared to those with full tendon healing. Isokinetic testing revealed 29-43% deficits in peak external rotation torque comparing complete retear vs. normal healing. Patients' ability to generate shoulder power and withstand a load proved to be lower in circumstances of a complete lack of healing (40-43% and 34-55%, respectively). Partial retears did not have a negative impact on the biomechanical properties of shoulders. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in the shoulder scores related to the quality of healing. In terms of patient satisfaction the results were good and the patients declared themselves better in all cases, no matter what quality of healing had been recorded ultimately. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of this research rotator cuff integrity after open or arthroscopic repair does not seem to affect clinical scores. Recurrent tears may result in lower muscle performance in terms of active motion, strength and endurance. Advanced shoulder testing may be essential in assessing the patients' ability to return to sports or heavy labour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine how repair technique influenced structural and clinical outcomes at 5 years post-surgery. METHODS: Three cohorts of patients had repair of a symptomatic rotator cuff tear using (i) an open double-row mattress repair technique (n = 25); (ii) arthroscopic single-row simple suture knotted technique (n = 25); or (iii) arthroscopic single-row inverted mattress knotless technique (n = 36) by one surgeon. Standardized patient- and examiner-determined outcomes were obtained pre-operatively and postoperatively with a validated protocol, ultrasound were also performed at the same time. RESULTS: Retear occurred more often after open repair (48%) at 5 years than after arthroscopic knotted (33%) and arthroscopic knotless (26%) repair. Retear was associated with increasing age, pre-operative tear size and weaker pre-operative and 5 years postoperative cuff strength. Between 2 years and 5 years, the open repair group experienced an increase in the frequency of pain during activity, as well as in the difficulty experienced and the severity of pain during overhead activities (p < 0.05) and, at 5 years, also experienced more difficulty with overhead activities, compared to the arthroscopic knotless repair group. CONCLUSIONS: At 5-year follow-up, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair techniques resulted in fewer retears and better outcomes compared to an open double-row technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited information regarding the effect of delamination tearing on the outcome of rotator cuff repair is available in the literature. Studies have reported equally good results for rotator cuff repair using an open, mini-open, and arthroscopic repair techniques. Negative results have been reported for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair when delamination is present. The purpose of this study was to assess the affect of delamination on the outcome of the arthroscopically assisted mini-open technique. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Two-hundred sixty-three consecutive operations were followed prospectively in this study. All underwent arthroscopically assisted mini-open repairs by a single surgeon. Patient demographics, compensation status, and tear characteristics were investigated. Variables were compared using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) pre-operatively and at 1 and 2 years postoperative. RESULTS: The incidence of delamination was 71% of rotator cuff tears. Patient demographics did not affect the incidence of delamination. The presence of delamination did not affect the outcome of mini-open rotator cuff repair. CONCLUSION: We believe this technique is better able to produce reliable outcomes in the presence of delamination tearing.

AB  - PURPOSE: To quantify the incidence and risk factors associated with subsequent shoulder procedures in individuals undergoing outpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). METHODS: We examined the New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative Systems outpatient database from 2003 through 2014 to identify patients undergoing isolated ARCR with or without concomitant acromioplasty. Patients were longitudinally followed up for a minimum of 2 years to determine the incidence of subsequent ipsilateral shoulder surgery. The impact of age, sex, insurance, concomitant acromioplasty, and tobacco use on reoperation was explored. RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2012, 30,430 patients underwent isolated ARCR. The mean age was 56.6 +/- 11.5 years, and 55.1% were male patients. A total of 1,826 patients (6.0%) underwent subsequent ipsilateral outpatient shoulder surgery a mean of 24.3 +/- 27.1 months after the initial ARCR. Of patients who underwent repeat surgery, 57.3% underwent a revision cuff repair. Patients who underwent additional outpatient shoulder surgery were significantly younger (53.7 +/- 10.9 years v 56.8 +/- 11.5 years, P < .001). Tobacco use was associated with an increased rate of subsequent surgery (7.3% v 5.9%, P = .044) and accelerated time to reoperation (16.9 months v 24.7 months, P < .001). Independent risk factors for subsequent ipsilateral surgery after initial ARCR were presence of a Workers' Compensation claim (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-2.36; P < .001) and initial ARCR without acromioplasty (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.34; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a 6.0% incidence of repeat ipsilateral surgery after isolated ARCR. Although reasons for reoperation are likely multifactorial, younger age, Workers' Compensation claim, and absence of acromioplasty at the time of initial ARCR remained independent predictors of subsequent outpatient procedures, whereas a history of tobacco use was associated with accelerated time to subsequent surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

AB  - Introduction: It is common for patients with a rotator cuff tear to present with shoulder stiffness. There is no consensus on the acceptable level of stiffness at time of rotator cuff repair. We aim to determine if patients with stiffness undergoing rotator cuff repair and concomitant capsular release have different outcome than those with no stiffness undergoing rotator cuff repair alone. We hypothesize that patients with stiffness will not have poorer outcome than patients with no stiffness. Method: We conducted a retrospective study of prospectively collected data for 47 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair under a single surgeon from 2010 to 2015. 25 patients were considered stiff (Stiff group) and 22 patients were considered to have no pre-operative stiffness (Non-stiff group). Range of motion and functional outcomes were collected preoperatively and post-operatively at two-years. Results: There were no significant differences in gender distribution, age and cuff tear size between both groups. Pre-operatively, patients in the Stiff group had significantly poorer active range of motion (Forward flexion - Stiff 74.8degree vs Non-stiff 100.2degree, P = 0.001) and poorer function (Constant score - Stiff 23.5 vs Non-stiff 43.2, P < 0.001). Post-operatively, both groups of patients had increased range of motion, strength and reported lesser pain compared to pre-operation. There were no significant differences in post-operative outcomes between both groups. Conclusion: Single-stage surgery combining capsular release and rotator cuff repair is effective for patients with stiffness as they are able to achieve similar results to those without shoulder stiffness.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate shoulder functional results and the retear rate of arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff augmented with platelet-rich plasma (PRP). METHODS: Prospective case series with single-row arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff augmented with PRP. Only cases of isolated supraspinatus tears with retraction of less than 3 cm were included in this series. The PRP used was obtained by apheresis. It was applied on liquid consistency in its activated form, with the addition of autologous thrombin. Patients were evaluated after 12 months of the surgical procedure. The Constant-Murley, UCLA and VAS scales were used, and the retear rate was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: Fourteen patients were evaluated (14 shoulders). The mean Constant-Murley score was 45.64 +/- 12.29 before the operation and evolved to 80.78 +/- 13.22 after the operation (p < 0.001). The UCLA score increased from 13.78 +/- 5.66 to 31.43 +/- 3.9 (p < 0.001). The patients' pain level decreased from a median of 7.5 (p25% = 6, p75% = 8) to 0.5 (p25% = 0, p75% = 3) (p = 0.0013) according to the VAS score. None of the patients presented complete retear. Three patients (21.4%) showed partial retear, without transfixation. Only one patient developed complications (adhesive capsulitis). CONCLUSION: Patients submitted to arthroscopic rotator cuff repair augmented with PRP showed significant functional improvement and none of them had complete retearing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tears are very common, but little is known about the outcome of nonoperative treatment of symptomatic tears in terms of progression and the need for surgical intervention. METHODS: Fifty-nine shoulders in fifty-four patients (thirty-three women and a mean age of 58.8 years) with rotator cuff tears on initial magnetic resonance imaging who had been managed nonoperatively were studied retrospectively. All had magnetic resonance imaging scans acquired six months or more after the initial study. The progression of the rotator cuff tears was associated with age, anatomical and associated parameters, follow-up time, and structural and other magnetic resonance imaging findings. RESULTS: Baseline magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated thirty-three full-thickness tears, twenty-six partial-thickness tears, and four combined full-thickness and partial-thickness tears. Fifty-eight of the fifty-nine tears involved the supraspinatus tendon, and ten involved multiple tendons. Progression in tear size occurred more often among the patients who were followed more than eighteen months (thirteen [48%] of twenty-seven shoulders) compared with those who were followed for less than eighteen months (six [19%] of thirty-two shoulders). Five tears (one partial-thickness tear) decreased in size. More than half (52%; seventeen) of the thirty-three full-thickness tears increased in size compared with 8% (two) of the twenty-six partial-thickness tears (p = 0.0005). Only 17% (six) of the thirty-five tears in patients who were sixty years old or less deteriorated compared with 54% (thirteen) of the twenty-four tears in patients who were more than sixty years old (p = 0.007). No shoulder in a patient with a partial-thickness tear demonstrated supraspinatus atrophy, whereas 24% of those with a full-thickness tear demonstrated atrophy (p = 0.007). The proportion with an increase in tear size was significantly larger for shoulders with fatty infiltration than for those without it (p = 0.0089). CONCLUSIONS: Factors that are associated with progression of a rotator cuff tear are an age of more than sixty years, a full-thickness tear, and fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscle(s). In the long-term follow-up of nonoperatively treated rotator cuff tears, magnetic resonance imaging can be used to monitor rotator cuff changes and guide patient management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anterosuperior (AS) rotator cuff tear describes a combined tear of the subscapularis and the supraspinatus tendons. We hypothesized that results after AS tendon repairs might be influenced by the size of the subscapularis rupture and the preoperative subscapularis muscle fatty infiltration. METHODS: A prospective multicentric study of 53 AS rotator cuff tears from five centers was performed (January 2008-January 2009). Subscapularis tendon retraction and fatty infiltration were assessed preoperatively. An ultrasonographic healing control was performed 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: Patients were on average 60 years (range, 43-75 years) and were operated on average 16 months (range, 2-72 months) after the beginning of their symptoms. The incidence of AS tears was found to be 18%. Average follow-up was 15 months (range, 12-24). The Constant-Murley (CM) score for the patients with AS ruptures improved significantly from 49 points (range, 35-51 points) preoperatively to 73 points postoperatively (range, 50-95 points)(P=0.0205). CM score gains were 26 for Lafosse group 1 ruptures and 29 for Lafosse group 2 & 3 with pre- and postoperative P values at P<0.0000001 and P<0.000001, respectively. The last follow-up CM score according to the subscapularis fatty infiltration was 70 (range, 48-95) for groups 0-1, 70 (range, 56-87) for group 2, and 56 (range, 53-88) for groups 3-4 with pre- and postoperative P values at P<0.001, P<0.001, and P<0.004, respectively. The global retear rate was 6%. DISCUSSION: Our study showed that the CM score after repairs of AS rotator cuff tears was lower in advanced subscapularis fatty infiltration. However, gains in CM scores were similar whatever the initial subscapularis fatty infiltration. The rate of tendon healing was correlated with subscapularis fatty infiltration. Subscapularis tendon rupture size was not significantly correlated with outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - PURPOSE: One of the complications after rotator cuff repair is a tendon non-healing. It has already been posited in the literature that vitamin C (VC) promotes tendon healing through its antioxidant properties and its role as a cofactor in collagen synthesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of postoperative VC supplementation on the tendon healing following repair. METHODS: This randomized monocentric prospective study included 98 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in 1-year period and follow-up ultrasound 6 months postoperatively. The cohort was divided into two groups: the VC+ group (500 mg/day PO for 45 days postoperatively) and the VC- group (no supplementation). The evaluation criterion was tendon healing at 6 months postoperatively according to the Sugaya ultrasound classification. Preoperative and postoperative clinical evaluations were based on active mobilities, the Constant score and the subjective shoulder value. RESULTS: There was no difference in term of postoperative outcomes between the two groups. At an average follow-up of 6.3 months, the non-healing rate in the overall population was 17%. This rate was higher in VC- compared to VC+, respectively, 23% vs. 11%), p = 0.2. CONCLUSION: This study showed a trend to improve tendon healing after rotator cuff repair with VC supplementation. However, a prospective study with a larger patient population should be conducted to confirm this finding.

AB  - Background: Arthroscopic cuff repair is a highly successful technique, but postoperative rehabilitation is complex and the rate of tear recurrence is not negligible. Biological augmentations have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a platelet-rich blood fraction that is applied on the repair site to enhance tendon healing. This study evaluates the effectiveness of PRP application in arthroscopic cuff repair. Materials and Methods: A prospective nonrandomized study was carried out on 22 patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Only patients with isolated and repairable supraspinatus tears were included and divided into two groups: 11 patients (Group A) received intraoperative PRP and 11 patients (Group B) did not. All patients had the same rehabilitation and followup protocol. Clinical-functional parameters (visual analog score, active range of motion, University of California at Los Angeles - UCLA, Constant) were recorded at predefined intervals, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 1 year postoperative. Results: Only one patient of Group B did not complete the study protocol. No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed. No differences were found in the clinical-functional parameters during the entire study. At 1 year, MRI showed 1 retear in Group A and 2 retears in Group B, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: The role of PRP as an adjuvant for surgical repair of rotator cuff tears is controversial. In this study, we could not demonstrate significant advantages of PRP for arthroscopic repair of isolated supraspinatus tears. The potential improvement in the structural outcome should be evaluated in the long term to justify the additional costs related to PRP application.

AB  - Background: Perianchor cyst formation (PCF) can occur after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) anchors; however, little is known about PCF after all-suture anchor (ASA) use. Methods: We reviewed patients who underwent double-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair from 2012 to 2017 with ASAs implanted in the medial row and PLLA anchors in the lateral row. We evaluated PCF (graded on magnetic resonance imaging) and compared physical examination and functional surveys between patients with PCF (WC) and without PCF (WoC) at long-term follow-up. Results: Among twenty-two patients (23 shoulders), 93% of PLLA anchors (vs. 79% ASA) displayed a grade 0 PCF, P = .100. No PLLA anchors had a grade 3 or 4 PCF, compared to 11% of ASAs, P = .158. At a mean postoperative follow-up time of 113 weeks, there was no significant difference between WC and WoC cohorts with regard to range of motion, rotator cuff strength, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons survey scores, or retear rates. However, the WoC cohort had a significantly higher University of California at Los Angeles shoulder survey score at final follow-up (34.3 WoC vs. 30.9 WC, P = .024). Conclusion: No difference was found in PCF between ASAs and PLLA anchors. At long-term follow-up, WoC patients had significantly improved functional outcome scores, based on the University of California at Los Angeles survey, but equivalent range of motion and rotator cuff strength examinations compared with WC patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether (1) the primary repair of rotator cuff tears can prevent the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) and (2) the quality of postoperative cuff integrity affects the incidence of osteoarthritic changes. METHODS: A total of 86 patients treated with mini-open repair for rotator cuff tears over a minimum of 10 years of follow-up (mean +/- standard deviation 11.1 +/- 1.0 years) were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs of the affected and unaffected sides were compared, and the degree of OA was evaluated using the Samilson and Prieto classification. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate cuff integrity, classify patients into good and poor cuff integrity groups, and compare the degree of OA between the two groups. RESULTS: OA deteriorated either significantly or to a similar degree on both sides postoperatively. However, OA progressed in significantly more cases on the affected side. A comparison between the aforementioned cuff integrity groups showed that the postoperative OA of the poor cuff integrity group was significantly worse than that of the good cuff integrity group on the affected side. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that even if rotator cuff tears are repaired, the progression of osteoarthritic changes cannot be halted. The progression of OA was affected by cuff integrity. Rotator cuff dysfunction due to poor cuff integrity was a risk factor for shoulder arthritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tear is a common disease for middle-aged and elderly patients, and relatively good postoperative outcomes have been reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to examine cases that underwent miniopen rotator cuff repair and to clarify their long-term clinical and imaging outcomes. METHODS: A total of 68 patients who underwent a miniopen repair for small- to medium-sized rotator cuff tears with good cuff integrity and without retear on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1 year postoperatively were followed up for a minimum of 10 years (mean +/- standard deviation: 11.4 +/- 1.2 years) and analyzed retrospectively. One-year and 10-year postoperative University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder scores and radiographs were compared. MRI was used to evaluate cuff integrity and fatty infiltration, and staging at 1 and 10 years was compared. RESULTS: The 1-year and 10-year postoperative UCLA scores were 33.1 points and 32.9 points, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Plain radiography showed that osteoarthritis (OA) staging was significantly worse at 10 years postoperatively compared to 1 year postoperatively. Cuff integrity was maintained at an excellent level at 10 years postoperatively. Fatty infiltration significantly progressed up to 10 years postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: At 10 years postoperatively, OA progression and fatty infiltration were observed; however, UCLA scores and cuff integrity remained well preserved.

AB  - Background: We aimed to determine if recognised histological features seen in specimens taken during rotator cuff repair could predict which tendon repairs were at risk of re-rupture. Methods: Forty rotator cuff tendon edge specimens from 40 patients were analysed histologically following routine mini-open rotator cuff repair. Thirty-two patients returned at a mean follow up of 35 months for an ultrasound examination to determine repair integrity. Results: Overall there were 8 small tears, 13 medium tears, 15 large tears and 4 massive tears. Of the 32 patients followed up with ultrasound scan (USS) the overall re-rupture rate was 46%. Small and medium tears had a re-rupture rate of 35% while 60% of the large and massive tears suffered a re-rupture. Comparison of histological features and repair integrity revealed that the rotator cuff repairs which remained intact demonstrated a greater reparative response, in terms of increased fibroblast cellularity, cell proliferation and a thickened synovial membrane, than those repairs that re-ruptured. The larger tears that did remain intact also showed a higher degree of vascularity and a significant inflammatory component than the larger tears that re-ruptured. Conclusion: These results indicate the importance of good tissue quality at the time of surgery but that larger tears can heal if the tissue quality is favourable. Post-operative histological analysis of tendon tear edge can aid prognosis and has the potential to guide post-operative immobilization and subsequent physiotherapy. © 2009 The British Elbow & Shoulder Society.

AB  - Background: Postoperative retear is the most common surgical complication after rotator cuff repair. This study aimed to determine whether there had been any improvements in rotator cuff repair integrity in our center and to identify any changes in the management of rotator cuff tears that may have impacted postoperative retear rate. Methods: This retrospective observational single cohort study used running average analysis to examine 1600 consecutive patients over 8 years, who underwent primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a single surgeon, and had cuff integrity assessed by ultrasound 6 months after operation. Results: Retear rates ranged from 3% to 34%, with a mean of 15%. Over our study retear rates decreased from 18% to 5%. Reductions in retear rates were associated with less aggressive rehabilitation, postoperative abduction sling use, and increased surgical experience. Increases in retear rates were associated with increased false positives with a more sensitive ultrasound machine and learning curves with new equipment for a surgeon and sonographer. Conclusion: A decrease in retear rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair occurred during our study. Although the study design prevents us from directly attributing changes in retear rate to changes in management, our results suggest that rehabilitation optimization and increased surgeon experience decrease postoperative retear.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure and compare the subjective, objective, and radiographic healing outcomes of single-row (SR), double-row (DR), and transosseous equivalent (TOE) suture techniques for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective comparative analysis of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs by one surgeon from 2004 to 2010 at minimum 2-year followup was performed. Cohorts were matched for age, sex, and tear size. Subjective outcome variables included ASES, Constant, SST, UCLA, and SF-12 scores. Objective outcome variables included strength, active range of motion (ROM). Radiographic healing was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), Mann - Whitney and Kruskal - Wallis tests with significance, and the Fisher exact probability test <0.05. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients completed the study requirements (20 SR, 21 DR, 22 TOE). There was a clinically and statistically significant improvement in outcomes with all repair techniques (ASES mean improvement P = <0.0001). The mean final ASES scores were: SR 83; (SD 21.4); DR 87 (SD 18.2); TOE 87 (SD 13.2); (P = 0.73). There was a statistically significant improvement in strength for each repair technique (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between techniques across all secondary outcome assessments: ASES improvement, Constant, SST, UCLA, SF-12, ROM, Strength, and MRI re-tear rates. There was a decrease in re-tear rates from single row (22%) to double-row (18%) to transosseous equivalent (11%); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to preoperatively, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, using SR, DR, or TOE techniques, yielded a clinically and statistically significant improvement in subjective and objective outcomes at a minimum 2-year follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level 3.

AB  - Objectives: Background: There is debate as to whether to operate or defer surgery on patients with concomitant rotator cuff tear and shoulder stiffness. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to compare the outcomes in those patients who had both their rotator cuff tear and shoulder stiffness treated with patients who had a rotator cuff repair but no stiffness. Method(s): Methods: 1232 primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs were performed during the study period, including 44 patients who received a concomitant glenohumeral joint capsule release for ipsilateral shoulder stiffness, forming the stiffness group. A chronologically matched group of four rotator cuff repair-only patients before and after each stiffness patient were chosen from the consecutive list of rotator cuff repairs. Twenty-five patients from the stiffness group and 170 patients from the non-stiffness group met the inclusion criteria, leaving a total cohort of 195 patients. Patients completed modified L'Insalata Questionnaires for patient-ranked pain and function scores pre-operatively, intra-operatively, and at one week, six weeks, 12 weeks, six months and two-years postoperatively, while examiners recorded range of motion, strength, and presence of impingement signs. Result(s): Results: Patients from both groups had significantly improved clinical outcomes at the two-year follow-up as compared to pre-operative values. Stiffness patients had 0/25 (0%) re-tears at two years, significantly less (p = 0.009) than the non-stiffness patients (34/170 [20%]). Range of motion was similar between groups at two-years for forward flexion, abduction and external rotation, while the non-stiffness group had a superior range of internal rotation (p < 0.02). Conclusion(s): Discussion: The good outcomes of rotator cuff repair with glenohumeral joint capsule release suggest that there is no advantage in delaying surgical repair of a rotator cuff tear to allow for stiffness to resolve. In contradistinction, the data presented in this paper suggests that shoulder stiffness with glenohumeral joint capsule release, confers an advantage in terms of repair integrity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is debate as to whether to operate or to defer surgery on patients with concomitant rotator cuff tear and shoulder stiffness. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare the outcomes in those patients who had both their rotator cuff tear and shoulder stiffness treated with the outcomes of patients who had a rotator cuff repair but no stiffness. METHODS: Twenty-five patients formed the stiffness group (receiving a concomitant rotator cuff repair and manipulation under anesthesia +/- arthroscopic capsular release for preoperative ipsilateral stiffness), and a chronologically matched group of 170 rotator cuff repair-only patients formed the nonstiffness group. Patients ranked their pain and function scores preoperatively and at 1 week, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years postoperatively; examiners recorded range of motion, strength, and presence of impingement signs. Repair integrity was determined using ultrasound. RESULTS: Patients from both groups had significantly improved clinical outcomes at the 2-year follow-up compared with preoperative values. Range of motion was similar between groups at 2 years for forward flexion, abduction, and external rotation, whereas the nonstiffness group had a superior range of internal rotation (P = .014). Stiffness patients had 0 of 25 (0%) retears at 2 years compared with 34 of 170 (20%) in the nonstiffness group (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: The good outcomes of rotator cuff repair with glenohumeral capsular release disproved our hypothesis and suggest that there is no advantage in delaying repair of a rotator cuff tear to allow stiffness to resolve and that stiffness confers an advantage in terms of repair integrity.

AB  - Background: Retear and stiffness are not uncommon outcomes of rotator cuff repair. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between rotator cuff repair healing and shoulder stiffness. Method(s): A total of 1,533 consecutive shoulders had an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by a single surgeon. Patients assessed their shoulder stiffness using a Likert scale preoperatively and at 1, 6, 12, and 24 weeks (6 months) postoperatively, and examiners evaluated passive range of motion preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Repair integrity was determined by ultrasound evaluation at 6 months. Result(s): After rotator cuff repair, there was an overall significant loss of patient-ranked and examiner-assessed shoulder motion at 6 weeks compared with preoperative measurements (p < 0.0001), a partial recovery at 12 weeks, and a full recovery at 24 weeks. Shoulders that were stiff before surgery were more likely to be stiff at 6, 12, and, to a lesser extent, 24 weeks after surgery (r = 0.10 to 0.31; p < 0.0001). A stiffer shoulder at 6 and 12 weeks (but not 24 weeks) postoperatively correlated with better rotator cuff integrity at 6 months postoperatively (r = 0.11 to 0.18; p < 0.001). The retear rate of patients with <=20 of external rotation at 6 weeks postoperatively was 7%, while the retear rate of patients with >20 of external rotation at 6 weeks was 15% (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): In patients who developed stiffness after surgery, a rotator cuff repair was more likely to heal. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the association between the acromial index (AI) and the incidence of recurrent tears of the rotator cuff (RC) in a cohort of patients with full thickness tears who underwent arthroscopic primary repair. METHODS: A prognostic study of a prospective case series of 103 patients with full thickness RC tears was undertaken. The average age was 59.5 years (39-74) and follow-up was 30.81 months (12-72). True anterior-posterior X-rays were obtained during the pre-operative evaluation. Pre and post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were recorded. RESULTS: Eighteen cases with recurrent tears (17.4%) were seen on post-operative MRI. The average AI for patients with recurrent tears was 0.711 +/- 0.065 and for patients without recurrent tears 0.710 +/- 0.064 (p < 0.05). A positive association between age and recurrent tears of the RC was noted (average ages: recurrent tears group 63 +/- 5.9 years; group without recurrent tears 58.8 +/- 7.5 years) (r = -0.216; p = 0.029). We did not find an association between size of the primary tear and recurrent tears (r = -0.075; p < 0.05) or between degrees of retraction of the primary and recurrent tears of the cuff (r = -0.073; p < 0.05). We observed that 38.9% of the recurrent tears cases presented with more than one tendon affected before the arthroscopy. At follow-up, none of these recurrent tears showed more than one tendon affected on MRI evaluation. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that the AI radiological measurement is not a predictor for recurrent tears of the RC after primary arthroscopic repair.

AB  - Background: Few studies have compared the clinical and radiological characteristics and outcomes in isolated subscapularis (SSC) and combined anterosuperior (AS) rotator cuff tears (RCTs). Furthermore, risk factors for retear after SSC repair and the effect of preoperative fatty degeneration require further evaluation. Purpose: To compare the functional and radiological outcomes of isolated SSC with combined AS RCTs after arthroscopic repair and to determine the risk factors for SSC retear in these 2 groups. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Data from 30 patients in the isolated SSC group were compared with data from 110 patients in the combined AS group. All patients underwent primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between 2010 and 2016. Clinical outcomes were assessed through use of the visual analog scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, and Simple Shoulder Test at a mean follow-up of 26.7 months (range, 24-96 months). SSC tendon integrity was examined via magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography arthrogram, or ultrasonography at least 1 year after surgery. Results: The isolated SSC group had a greater proportion of males and the patients were younger compared with the combined AS group (both P < .050). The incidence of trauma was high but not significantly different between groups (56.7% vs 40.9%; P = .180). Clinical outcome measures and radiological outcomes in terms of retear were not statistically different between both groups (16.7% vs 8/5%; P = .337). The optimal cutoff values for the risk of SSC tendon retear in both groups were 19-mm retraction and 16-mm superoinferior dimension (P = .048). Unfavorable preoperative fatty degeneration of the SSC muscle (grades 3 and 4) was a significant risk factor for retear (odds ratio, 9.8; P < .001). Conclusion: Isolated SSC and combined AS RCTs were comparable except for patient age and sex; both had a high incidence of traumatic history. The current data suggest that the risk factors for retear after SSC repair in RCTs involving the SSC were tear size greater than 19 mm of retraction and unfavorable fatty degeneration (grade 3 or higher) of the SSC muscle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The structural failure rate of rotator cuff repair can exceed 50%. Important predictors for repair failure are preoperative fatty muscle infiltration and myotendinous retraction. PURPOSE: To quantitatively assess the prognostic value of preoperative retraction of both the supraspinatus muscle and tendon for the outcome of supraspinatus repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: In 33 shoulders with complete supraspinatus tendon ruptures subjected to arthroscopic repair, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken preoperatively and after a mean follow-up of 24 months were studied. The exact position of the lateral extension of the supraspinatus muscle and of the tendon end was evaluated and correlated with the preoperative stage of fatty infiltration (Goutallier) and the failure rate of tendon repair. RESULTS: The mean lengthening of the muscle and tendon end was -3 mm and 4 mm in the failed repairs (n = 19) and 14 mm and 8 mm in the successful repairs (n = 14). If the supraspinatus had preoperative Goutallier stages 2 to 3 and a tendon length of less than 15 mm, the failure rate was 92%, but if the tendon length was greater than 15 mm, the failure rate was only 33%. With Goutallier stages 0 to 1, the corresponding failure rates were 57% and 25%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Rotator cuff repair lengthens the tendon, even if the repair fails. The possibility to lengthen the myotendinous unit is related to the preoperative length of the tendon. The combination of Goutallier grading and preoperative tendon length appears to be a more powerful predictor for the reparability of a tendon tear than Goutallier grading alone.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of osteolysis around the bioabsorbable and nonabsorbable anchors using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to determine the relationship between osteolysis and the retear rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: From July 2012 to July 2014, 50 patients [28 men and 22 women; mean age, 56.4 (range: 45-56) years] underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for a medium-to large-size tear with double-row suture-bridge technique. The bioabsorbable anchors used in the medial row comprised hydroxyapatite-polylactic acid enantiomer, and the nonabsorbable anchors in the lateral row were polyetheretherketone (PEEK)-type anchors. All patients underwent MRI evaluation at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively to determine osteolysis and identify any retear. RESULTS: The incidences of osteolysis at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively were 1%, 4%, and 6% with nonabsorbable anchors and 13%, 29%, and 39% with bioabsorbable anchors, respectively. The incidences of osteolysis were significantly higher with the bioabsorbable anchors than with the nonabsorbable anchors (P < 0.005 for all three follow-ups). There was no significant difference between osteolysis and non-osteolysis groups regarding the retear rate or retear size (P = 0.189 and 0.069, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Osteolysis was common around bioabsorbable anchors used for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, and it also occurred around the PEEK-type nonabsorbable anchors. The incidence of osteolysis of nonabsorbable anchors was significantly lower than that of bioabsorbable anchors. Osteolysis did not significantly affect rotator cuff retear after arthroscopic repair with either bioabsorbable or nonabsorbable anchors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Therapeutic Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although previous biomechanical research has demonstrated the superiority of the suture-bridge rotator cuff repair over double-row repair from a mechanical point of view, no articles have described the structural and functional outcomes of this type of procedure. HYPOTHESIS: The structural and functional outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair may be different between the single-row, double-row, and combined double-row and suture-bridge (compression double-row) techniques. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: There were 206 shoulders in 201 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears that underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Eleven patients were lost to follow-up. Sixty-five shoulders were repaired using the single-row, 23 shoulders using the double-row, and 107 shoulders using the compression double-row techniques. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at an average of 38.5 months (range, 24-74 months) after rotator cuff repair. Postoperative cuff integrity was determined using Sugaya's classification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: The retear rates after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were 10.8%, 26.1%, and 4.7%, respectively, for the single-row, double-row, and compression double-row techniques. In the subcategory of large and massive rotator cuff tears, the retear rate in the compression double-row group (3 of 40 shoulders, 7.5%) was significantly less than those in the single-row group (5 of 8 shoulders, 62.5%, P < .001) and the double-row group (5 of 12 shoulders, 41.7%, P < .01). Postoperative clinical outcomes in patients with a retear were significantly lower than those in patients without a retear for all 3 techniques. CONCLUSION: The additional suture bridges decreased the retear rate for large and massive tears. The combination of the double-row and suture-bridge techniques, which had the lowest rate of postoperative retear, is an effective option for arthroscopic repair of the rotator cuff tendons because the postoperative functional outcome in patients with a retear is inferior to that without retear.

AB  - UNLABELLED: There have been technologic advances in the methods for repairing torn rotator cuffs. We compared the clinical and structural outcomes of three different forms of rotator cuff repair with up to 24 months' followup. We wished to assess how surgical technique affected clinical outcomes and see how these correlated to repair integrity. Three cohorts of patients had repair of a symptomatic rotator cuff tear using (1) an open technique (n = 49); (2) arthroscopic knotted (n = 53); or (3) arthroscopic knotless (n = 57) by one surgeon. Standardized patient- and examiner-determined outcomes were obtained preoperatively and at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and 2 years postoperatively. Ultrasound studies were performed with a validated protocol at 6 months and 2 years postsurgery. Clinical outcomes were similar with the exception that the arthroscopic groups had, on average, 20% better American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores than the open group at 6 months and 2 years. Retear correlated with tear size and operation time and occurred more frequently after open repair (39%) than after arthroscopic knotted (25%) and arthroscopic knotless (16%) repair. An intact cuff on ultrasound corresponded to better results for supraspinatus strength, patient outcomes, and rotator cuff functional ability. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes of two commonly used transosseous-equivalent (TOE) arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) techniques for full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears (FTST) using a robust multi-predictor model. METHODS: 155 shoulders in 151 patients (109 men, 42 women; mean age 59 +/- 10 years) who underwent arthroscopic RCR of FTST, using either a knotted suture bridging (KSB) or a knotless tape bridging (KTB) TOE technique were included. ASES and SF-12 PCS scores assessed at a minimum of 2 years postoperatively were modeled using propensity score weighting in a multiple linear regression model. Patients able to return to the study center underwent a follow-up MRI for evaluation of rotator cuff integrity. RESULTS: The outcome data were available for 137 shoulders (88%; n = 35/41 KSB; n = 102/114 KTB). Seven patients (5.1%) that underwent revision rotator cuff surgery were considered failures. The median postoperative ASES score of the remaining 130 shoulders was 98 at a mean follow-up of 2.9 years (range 2.0-5.4 years). A higher preoperative baseline outcome score and a longer follow-up had a positive effect, whereas a previous RCR and workers' compensation claims (WCC) had a negative effect on final ASES or SF 12 PCS scores. The repair technique, age, gender and the number of anchors used for the RCR had no significant influence. Fifty-two patients returned for a follow-up MRI at a mean of 4.4 years postoperatively. Patients with a KSB RCR were significantly more likely to have an MRI-diagnosed full-thickness rotator cuff re-tear (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Excellent outcomes can be achieved at a minimum of 2 years following arthroscopic KSB or KTB TOE RCR of FTST. The preoperative baseline outcome score, a prior RCR, WCC and the length of follow-up significantly influenced the outcome scores. The repair technique did not affect the final functional outcomes, but patients with KTB TOE RCR were less likely to have a full-thickness rotator cuff re-tear. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Retrospective Comparative Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiffness and retear are 2 common complications of rotator cuff repair. McNamara et al found that postoperative stiffness was associated with lower retear rates at 6 months. This study aimed to determine if stiffness after rotator cuff repair protects the individual from retear up to 9 years after surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two groups of patients, 69 with stiff and 63 with nonstiff shoulder, who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were created based on external rotation measurements at 6 weeks postoperatively. Patients had regular follow-up assessments at 6, 12, and 24 weeks and were instructed to return for a follow-up at least 2 years after surgery. Patients were assessed for range of motion, shoulder function, strength, and rotator cuff integrity using ultrasound. RESULTS: For patients with postoperative stiffness at 6 weeks, the retear rate at 6 months was 3%, whereas the rate for nonstiff patients was 19% (P = .004). This protective effect of postoperative stiffness persisted up to 9 years after surgery (P = .002). Postoperative stiffness resolved by 5 years after surgery for all measurements except external rotation (50degree vs. 61degree) (P = .006). Patients with postoperative stiffness had continued improvements in abduction (P < .001), internal rotation (P = .020), and all patient-ranked measurements from the 6-month follow-up to 5 years after surgery. Patients with stiff shoulder had greater overall satisfaction by the final follow-up (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS: In patients experiencing stiffness after rotator cuff surgery, the repair is less likely to fail at 6 months. Although the stiffness generally resolves by 5 years, this protective effect still persists at 9 years after surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have specifically evaluated the development of cuff-tear arthropathy (CTA) after a rotator cuff repair in the postoperative early to mid-term. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with the development of CTA, to evaluate the effect of arthropathy on functional outcomes, and to evaluate the incidence of CTA 3-10 years after an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: A total of 312 patients who underwent an arthroscopic repair of a large or massive full-thickness rotator cuff tear with a minimum follow-up of 3 years were retrospectively divided into 2 groups for analysis: those with postrepair CTA (arthritic glenohumeral changes due to rotator cuff insufficiency) and those without. CTA was assessed using the Seebauer and modified Hamada-Fukuda classification systems. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative patient characteristics; characteristics of the rotator cuff tear; clinical and radiological parameters; and pre- and postoperative functional scores were compared. RESULTS: The rate of development of CTA was 11.5% (36 of 312 patients, 13 centric and 23 eccentric arthropathy). CTA was more frequently associated with the poor integrity of the supraspinatus tendon after repair (P < .001) and massive tears (P = .006). Postoperative pseudoparalysis (P < .001), symptomatic retear (P < .001), tear size (P = .026), critical shoulder angle (P = .001), preoperative acromiohumeral interval (P = .046), and the humeral head superior migration (P = .001) were found to be associated with the development of CTA. However, only postoperative pseudoparalysis was found to be an independent risk factor (P < .001, odds ratio: 2.965). Patients with postrepair CTA had significantly worse functional outcome scores. CONCLUSION: The postoperative development of pseudoparalysis may be a marker of CTA in the future and that closer follow-up may be necessary.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of arthroscopic cuff reconstruction, which is currently preferred in our service, and to compare functional outcome after arthroscopic cuff reconstruction comparing different types and sizes of rotator cuff tears. We switched completely from open repair to the full-arthroscopic repair > ten years ago, and since then, we are developing a technique that can produce the best results. Therefore, we decided to verify results. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with rotator cuff tear underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Single-row arthroscopic repair using double-loaded metal anchors and margin-convergence sutures with concomitant procedures were performed in all cases. All patients were assessed and classified before and after surgery using the Constant scoring system and the Oxford Shoulder Score. Tears were measured and classified as medium (1-3 cm), large(3-5 cm) and massive (>5 cm). RESULTS: The average age of participants was 59 +/- 9 years (33-76). There were five medium, 43 large and 23 massive tears. The average functional Constant score at the last follow-up was 91.68 +/- 10.62, and the Oxford score averaged 43.23 +/- 5.84 without statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) among groups Best results were in the massive-tear group, with an overall Constant score of 98.60 +/- 2.61 and an average Oxford score of 47.60 +/- 0.55. Full recovery was obtained between six months and one year. We used our own modified rehabilitation protocol and found no postoperative stiffness in this series. CONCLUSIONS: Single-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using double-loaded metal anchors and margin-convergence sutures with concomitant procedures, when necessary, provides excellent results. Pain, range of motion, muscle strength and function were significantly improved after single-row repair among all morphological types of cuff lesions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcome and rotator cuff integrity after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) in patients with and without diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This retrospective study involved 264 consecutive patients who underwent ARCR from 2012 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were a medium or large-sized tear and a minimum of 1-year follow-up. Clinical outcome measures included range of motion (ROM) and the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores preoperatively and at final follow-up. Rotator cuff retear was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging at 3 months post-surgery and final follow-up. Diabetic patients with poor control were pre-operatively hospitalized for intensive diabetic control. RESULTS: Our inclusion criteria were met by 30 diabetic patients and 126 non-diabetic patients. Demographic data were not significantly different between the groups, except body mass index (p = 0.021). Preoperative JOA and UCLA scores of the diabetic patients were significantly lower than those of the non-diabetic patients (p < 0.001, and p = 0.006, respectively); however, the scores at final follow-up were not different. ROM was significantly restricted in the diabetic patients before surgery (forward flexion, abduction, internal rotation: p < 0.001, external rotation: p = 0.035), but at the final follow-up, there was no significant difference except for internal rotation (p = 0.005). The retear rate in diabetic patients (23.3%) was not significantly different from that in non-diabetic patients (15.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients who had good perioperative glycemic control showed clinical and structural outcomes comparable to non-diabetic patients after ARCR. Intensive perioperative glycemic control and patient education are recommended for preoperative uncontrolled diabetic patients. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - <b>Purpose</b> There is still conflicting evidence to support postoperative rehabilitation protocols using immobilization following rotator cuff repair over early motion. The objective of the study was to evaluate the evolution of pain, shoulder function, and patients' perception of their health status up to 1 year after cuff rotator repair and a standard postoperative rehabilitation protocol consisting of 4 weeks of immobilization followed by a 2-week assisted controlled rehabilitation. <b>Methods</b> Descriptive, longitudinal, uncontrolled case-series study was performed on 49 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair following traumatic or degenerative lesions. VAS scale for pain, Constant-Murley score for function, and SF-12 score for quality of life were used as outcome measures and were administered before the rehabilitation treatment, at the end of the 2-week rehabilitation, 3 months, and 1 year after surgery. <b>Results</b> VAS pain score decreased significantly along the follow-up reaching almost a nil value after 1 year (0.2). Function as measured by Constant-Murley score had a significant improvement during follow-up, reaching a mean value of 84.6. The short form (SF)-12 score increased over time reaching 46.3 for the physical and 43.8 for the psychological dimension, respectively, at 1 year. <b>Conclusion</b> The present study confirmed an excellent outcome at 1 year after rotator cuff repair using a traditional 4-week immobilization followed by a 2-week rehabilitation protocol without evidence of tendon un-healing or re-tearing. <b>Level of Evidence</b> This is a level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - In a prospective study, 87 consecutive patients with 88 chronic, full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff were randomly assigned to either open surgical tendon repair and anterior acromioplasty (50 shoulders) or arthroscopic debridement and subacromial decompression (38 shoulders). All patients were reexamined 2 to 5 years after the operation with the University of California at Los Angeles 35-Point Scale for Pain and Function of the Shoulder. The average ratings were 30.5 (rotator cuff repair) and 25.1 (arthoscopic debridement/decompression) for each group. The open surgical repair group faired significantly better than the arthroscopic debridement group (p = .0028). Thirteen required subsequent procedures, four with tendon repair and nine with decompression. Five in the decompression group experienced cuff tear arthropathy. Surgical repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears provided results superior to those of arthroscopic debridement and subacromial decompression.

AB  - We compared clinical outcome between the Speed- Bridge technique and single-row techniques in patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and figured out the patterns of retear by computed tomography (CT) arthrogram and ultrasonography follow-up. In total 209 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and were followed up for at least 2-year were enrolled retrospectively (group 1: single-row repair, group 2: Speed-Bridge repair). Pre- and postoperative data were reviewed to assess clinical and radiologic outcomes. There were no significant differences in clinical outcome between the 2 groups. The retear rates of medium and large-sized rotator cuff tear groups were higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the medial row failure rate between the 2 groups. Present study showed that the knotless suture Bridge technique may be a considerable alternative method for treating full-thickness rotator cuff-tears. Level of evidence: Level III, Retrospective comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural course of nonoperatively treated rotator cuff tears is not fully understood. We explored the long-term development of tear anatomy and assessed functional outcomes. METHODS: Eighty-nine small to medium-sized full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff, all primarily treated by physiotherapy, were identified retrospectively. Twenty-three tears needed surgical treatment later on, and 17 patients were unable to meet for follow-up. The remaining 49 still unrepaired tears were re-examined after 8.8 (8.2-11.0) years with sonography. Re-examination by magnetic resonance imaging was possible for 37 patients. Shoulder function was assessed with shoulder scores. Primary outcome measures were progression of tear size, muscle atrophy, and fatty degeneration and the Constant score (CS). RESULTS: Mean tear size increased by 8.3 mm in the anterior-posterior plane (P = .001) and by 4.5 mm in the medial-lateral plane (P = .001). Increase of tear size was -5 to +9.9 mm in 33 patients, 10 to 19.9 mm in 8 patients, and >=20 mm in 8 patients. The CS was 81 points for tear increases <20 mm and 58.5 points for increases >=20 mm (P = .008). Muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration progressed in 18 and 15 of the 37 patients, respectively. In tears with no progression of atrophy, the CS was 82 points compared with 75.5 points in tears with progression (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic tear deterioration was found in the majority of patients, but it was often moderate. Large tear size increases and progression of muscle atrophy were correlated to a poorer functional outcome.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess rotator cuff rupture characteristics and evaluate healing and the functional outcome after arthroscopic repair in patients older than 70 years versus patients younger than 50 years. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, comparative study of 40 patients younger than 50 years (group A) and 40 patients older than 70 years (group B) treated with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Patients older than 70 years were operated on only if symptoms persisted after 6 months of conservative treatment, whereas patients younger than 50 years were operated on regardless of any persistent symptoms. Imaging consisted of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and postoperative ultrasound. Preoperative and postoperative function was evaluated with Constant and modified Constant scores. Patient satisfaction was also assessed. The evaluations were performed at least 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: No patient was lost to follow-up. The incidence of both supraspinatus and infraspinatus tears was greater in group B. Greater retraction in the frontal plane and greater fatty infiltration were observed in group B. The Constant score was significantly improved in both groups (51 +/- 12.32 preoperatively v 77.18 +/- 11.02 postoperatively in group A and 48.8 +/- 10.97 preoperatively v 74.6 +/- 12.02 postoperatively in group B, P < .05). The improvement was similar in both groups. The modified Constant score was also significantly improved in both groups (57.48 +/- 18.23 preoperatively v 81.35 +/- 19.75 postoperatively in group A and 63.09 +/- 14.96 preoperatively v 95.62 +/- 17.61 postoperatively in group B, P < .05). The improvement was greater for group B (P < .05). Partial rerupture of the rotator cuff occurred in 2 cases in group A and 5 cases in group B. Complete rerupture was observed in 2 patients in group B. In group A, 29 patients (72.5%) were very satisfied, 8 (20%) were satisfied, and 3 (7.5%) were less satisfied. In group B, 33 patients (82.5%) were very satisfied, 6 (15%) were satisfied, and only 1 (2.5%) was less satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Rotator cuff tears are characterized by greater retraction in the frontal plane and greater fatty infiltration in patients older than 70 years compared with patients younger than 50 years. After arthroscopic repair, healing is greater for patients younger than 50 years. Functional gain is at least equal between the 2 groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - Background: The presence of delamination and a larger rotator cuff tear (RCT) size have been associated with poorer outcomes in rotator cuff repair. Therefore, we developed a new surgical procedure, arthroscopic lamina-specific double-row fixation (ALSDR), for the repair of large delaminated RCTs. Purpose: To investigate the clinical outcomes, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and satisfaction with several variables after ALSDR for large delaminated RCTs. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: A total of 30 active patients (mean age, 59.1 years) undergoing ALSDR were assessed by a numeric rating scale (NRS; 0-10) for pain, surgery, work, and exercise as well as American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Constant, and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores at a mean of 65.9 months postoperatively. Rotator cuff integrity was determined by magnetic resonance imaging. The Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) was used to determine the correlation between clinical and NRS scores. Results: Five patients (16.7%) had a retear. Each of the postoperative functional and NRS scores except the NRS work score was significantly better in the healed shoulders than in the shoulders with a retear (P < .001). The NRS pain score showed a significant negative correlation with ASES, Constant, and SST scores (rho = -0.775, -0.668, and -0.742, respectively; P < .001 for all). The NRS surgery score had a positive correlation with Constant and SST scores (rho = 0.393 [P = .032] and rho = 0.456 [P = .011], respectively). The NRS work score had a positive correlation with ASES, Constant, and SST scores (rho = 0.382 [P = .037], rho = 0.386 [P = .035], and rho = 0.414 [P = .023], respectively). The NRS exercise score had a positive correlation with ASES, Constant, and SST scores (rho = 0.567 [P = .001], rho = 0.511 [P = .004], and rho = 0.639 [P < .001], respectively). Conclusion: Our results showed that there was a significant correlation between clinical and NRS scores. The results indicate that ALSDR can provide a high degree of functionality and can be a useful alternative treatment for active patients with large delaminated RCTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sugaya classification is a widely accepted classification system that is used to analyze postoperative rotator cuff tendon integrity. However, there are inconsistencies in the literature as to whether type 3 Sugaya should be considered as a retear or healed tendon. PURPOSE: We aimed to show that type 3 Sugaya is not a retear by comparing the long-term supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle degeneration and the functional outcomes of type 3 with those of type 4 and 5 Sugaya. We hypothesized that the clinical course of type 3 Sugaya would be different from type 4 or 5 Sugaya. METHOD: The study was a retrospective multicenter review of all the rotator cuff repair done in 2003-2004. We included all the patients who had undergone supraspinatus repair with 10-year follow-up (magnetic resonance imaging done with full functional assessment). Data collection included pre- and postoperative supraspinatus and infraspinatus fatty infiltration, supraspinatus muscle atrophy, and Constant score with a separate analysis of its Strength subsection. Supraspinatus tendon integrity at 10-year follow-up was determined according to Sugaya classification. The patients were divided into 2 groups: type 3 Sugaya and type 4 and 5 Sugaya. Statistical comparison was done between the groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the preoperative fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, supraspinatus muscle atrophy, and Constant score between the 2 groups. However, type 3 Sugaya patients had significantly better scores in the preoperative Strength subsection. Postoperatively, type 3 Sugaya patients showed significantly lesser fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus, lesser supraspinatus muscle atrophy, and higher Constant score compared with type 4 and 5 Sugaya (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients with type 3 Sugaya supraspinatus tendon exhibited lesser muscle degeneration in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus and performed better in functional assessment compared with type 4 and 5 Sugaya patients. We inferred that type 3 Sugaya should not be considered as a retear.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes between 2 suturing procedures, conventional en masse suture bridging (EMSB) and dual-layer suture bridging (DLSB), for delaminated rotator cuff tears. METHODS: From January 2011 through December 2015, 98 consecutive cases with delaminated rotator cuff tears were included in this study (52 with EMSB and 46 with DLSB). The mean age was 65.0 +/- 8.9 years (range, 38-85 years). The mean follow-up period was 28.0 +/- 6.3 months (range, 24-40 months). The cases included 78 medium tears (1-3 cm) and 20 large tears (3-5 cm). The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) rating scale, the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), a visual analog scale for pain, and active range of motion of the shoulder preoperatively and 2 years after surgery were evaluated. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at 12 months after surgery. RESULTS: Both the EMSB and DLSB groups showed improved clinical outcomes. Postoperative UCLA and SST scores were higher in the DLSB group than in the EMSB group (UCLA score, 33.2 +/- 2.3 vs 32.0 +/- 3.3 [P = .027]; SST score, 10.0 +/- 1.0 vs 9.5 +/- 1.2 [P = .014]). Postoperative abduction and external rotation of the shoulder were greater in the DLSB group than in the EMSB group (abduction, 160.1degree +/- 9.1degree vs 154.8degree +/- 19.8degree [P = .030]; external rotation, 53.7degree +/- 8.5degree vs 46.1degree +/- 9.4degree [P = .023]). Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging showed a retear in 7 of 52 cases in the EMSB group and 3 of 46 cases in the DLSB group, with no significant difference between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The DLSB and EMSB procedures for delaminated rotator cuff tears improved clinical and radiographic outcomes, and the DLSB group achieved better postoperative range of motion of the shoulder than the EMSB group. The DLSB procedure is useful for repairing delaminated rotator cuff tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective, case-control, comparative study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonsurgically treated rotator cuff tears sometimes become irreparable in the lead up to surgical repair. The purposes of our study were to identify predictive factors in the progression of tear size, and determine the changes in tear location. METHODS: Eighty shoulders from 71 patients (mean age 69.4 years) diagnosed with rotator cuff tears by MRI were treated nonsurgically. MRI was repeated after more than 1 year of initial diagnosis. Tear size was measured from the edge of the tear to the lateral aspect of the greater tuberosity. Tears were classified into 5 groups based on tear size and 4 groups based on tear location. Changes in tear size and location were examined. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 22.3 months. The average progression of tear size was 5 mm during follow-up, averaging 3 mm per year. Tears that were initially <1 or >=4 cm were unlikely to progress in tear size. On the other hand, 1- to 2-cm tears on the initial MRI exhibited the greatest progression in tear size, followed by 2- to 3-cm tears. Furthermore, 62.5 % of localized tears in the posterior of the superior facet spread anteriorly, whereas 88.9 % of localized tears in the anterior of the superior facet did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Medium-sized tears are at high risk of tear progression. In contrast, there is little risk of early development of irreparable damage in partial tear or small full-thickness tears. In addition, typical tears may start in the posterior of the superior facet, and subsequently spread anteriorly. Our present findings may serve as a useful reference in determining the treatment course for rotator cuff tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Case Series, Prognosis Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine important factors that affect clinical outcomes following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). METHODS: Among 163 patients who underwent ARCR, we included 71 shoulders in 71 patients whose progress was monitored for > 2 years, postoperatively. We divided the patients into groups A (scores >= 83 points, 59 patients) and B (scores < 83 points, 12 patients) using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score at 24 months. We then conducted univariate and multivariate analyses of pre- and postoperative (2 and 3 months, respectively) factors. RESULTS: The mean JOA score for all patients significantly improved from 63.7 +/- 11.5 points preoperatively to 90.3 +/- 9.6 points at 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant between-group differences in the preoperative scores. In addition, there were no significant differences in the postoperative re-tear rate. Univariate analysis revealed that the range of motion (preoperative abduction and postoperative elevation, abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation), muscle strength (external rotation 3 months postoperatively), postoperative pain level [visual analog scale (VAS) maximum score, 10 points], partial repair, Cofield classification, and preoperative width were significant factors (P < 0.05 for all factors). Multivariate and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that VAS at 2 months postoperatively and elevation at 3 months postoperatively were significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: To obtain a JOA score of >= 83 points at 24 months postoperatively, following ARCR, a postoperative VAS of < 5 points at 2 months and postoperative elevation of >= 110degree at 3 months should be achieved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) generally yields acceptable clinical results. Hyaluronic acid (HA), a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide, is present in the extracellular matrix of soft connective tissue and synovial fluid, and its injection is known to significantly improve pain and clinical outcomes after rotator cuff injury. Some studies have described the role of HA injections as conservative therapy for rotator cuff tears. Since the subacromial bursa is believed to be the main source of shoulder pain in rotator cuff tears, subacromial injection is frequently used before surgery; however, its relationship with the clinical outcome after surgery remains unclarified. Therefore, we aimed to examine effects of preoperative subacromial HA injection on postoperative clinical outcome in patients with ARCR. METHODS: Ninety-eight patients were divided into a HA injection group and a non-injection group. The functional outcome measured was the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score. Univariate analysis was performed to obtain variables with p values less than 0.1; we then used propensity score analysis, adjusting for pre- and post-operative confounding factors. RESULTS: The UCLA scores of all patients significantly improved 1 year postoperatively (PO) (p < 0.05). Subacromial HA injections were performed in patients with worse preoperative function. Univariate analysis showed significantly greater improvements in the injection group than in the non-injection group in terms of preoperative UCLA score, trauma, diabetes mellitus, UCLA score 3 months PO, abduction strength 4 months PO, and internal rotation (IR) strength 6 and 12 months PO. Propensity score analysis demonstrated that UCLA scores 3 months PO and IR strength 12 months PO in the injection group were significantly greater than those in the non-injection group. There were no significant differences in postoperative re-tear rates between the groups. In sub-analysis of the injection group, propensity scores showed that concurrent use of local anesthetics did not affect the data, suggesting that HA was effective. CONCLUSION: Subacromial injection was administered to patients with worse function before ARCR. Propensity score analysis successfully demonstrated that functional outcome after surgery was improved in patients who were administered this injection compared with patients who were not administered this injection before surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to assess the repair site integrity after transosseous equivalent/suture-bridge (TOE/SB) repair with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: One hundred seven consecutive shoulders with a small to medium-size full-thickness supraspinatus tear were repaired arthroscopically with use of the TOE/SB technique. There were 64 men and 41 women, and mean age at the time of surgery was 54.8 years (range, 21 to 74 years). All patients underwent postoperative MRI and clinical examination. Mean follow-up was 16.1 months (range, 12 to 28 months). RESULTS: The mean Constant score improved from 54.5 +/- 12.5 points preoperatively to 80 +/- 12.1 points postoperatively (P < .0001). The mean pain score improved from 7 +/- 2 points preoperatively to 13 +/- 2.5 postoperatively (P < .0001). The mean active forward flexion improved from 151degree +/- 37degree preoperatively to 169degree +/- 14degree postoperatively (P < .0001). The mean Constant score was 81 points when repaired tendon had healed and it was 72.6 points when repaired tendon was unhealed (P = .02). Smoking status was found to have detrimental influence on the tendon healing (P = .04). Postoperative MRI showed a healed repair in 96 (89.7%) of 107 shoulders. Among 11 retears, 10 occurred at the greater tuberosity and 1 occurred at the musculotendinous junction. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic TOE/SB repair of full-thickness supraspinatus tendon led to a healing rate of 89.7%. Patients with healed tendons according to MRI had significant better functional and subjective outcome. Smoking habit was found to be detrimental on healing. Retears occurred mainly at tendon-bone interface at the greater tuberosity, whereas medial cuff failure was observed in only one case in the mean time of follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Open repair of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff generally improves function, although anatomic failures are not uncommon. We asked whether the presence or absence of an anatomic repair influenced outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed 47 patients (49 shoulders) treated by open proximalized reinsertion of the supraspinatus tendon for chronic retracted detachment. The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 59 years. At a minimum 60-month followup (mean, 87 months; range, 60-133 months), we observed an improvement in the age- and gender-adjusted Constant-Murley score from 67% preoperatively to 95% postoperatively and in the pain score. With the last followup MRI, the supraspinatus tendon had reruptured in five patients (12%); the presence of a rerupture did not negatively influence the functional result. Once healing of the repaired tendons was achieved, supraspinatus muscle atrophy never worsened. However, on MRI, fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles increased postoperatively despite tendon healing. Radiographic centering of the humeral head was preserved and glenohumeral arthritis remained stable. Functional results were better when the standardized supraspinatus muscle area was greater than 0.5 at the final evaluation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of tendon tear size, in terms of length and retraction, on clinical and anatomic outcomes following repair for isolated subscapularis tears. Method(s): The records of 47 consecutive repairs of isolated subscapularis lesions were studied to correlate pre-operative tear characteristics with clinical and radiographic outcomes. Result(s): Forty patients had complete radiographic outcomes at 3.2 +/- 1.1 years, of which 36 had complete clinical outcomes at 3.5 +/- 0.9 years. Re-tears were observed in five shoulders (12.5 %). Fatty infiltration increased by one grade in 20 shoulders (50 %), and by two grades in four shoulders (10 %). Pre-operative tear size was associated with the post-operative belly-press test (BPT) (p = 0.042) and fatty infiltration (p = 0.051). Pre-operative tendon retraction was associated with post-operative BPT (p < 0.001) and fatty infiltration (p = 0.023). Conclusion(s): Our results do not entirely prove that prognostic factors used for superior and posterior tendon tears apply for the subscapularis. Pre-operative tendon retraction is a better predictor of outcomes than tear size. When tear size and tendon retraction are simultaneously severe, re-tears and poor outcomes are more likely.

AB  - Purpose To determine the degree of preoperative fatty degeneration within muscles, postoperative longitudinal changes in fatty degeneration, and differences in fatty degeneration between patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tears who do and those who do not experience a retear after surgery. Materials and Methods This prospective study had institutional review board approval and was conducted in accordance with the Committee for Human Research. Informed consent was obtained. Fifty patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tears (18 men, 32 women; mean age, 67.0 years +/- 8.0; age range, 41-91 years) were recruited. The degrees of preoperative and postoperative fatty degeneration were quantified by using a two-point Dixon magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence; two radiologists measured the mean signal intensity on in-phase [S(In)] and fat [S(Fat)] images. Estimates of fatty degeneration were calculated with "fat fraction" values by using the formula S(Fat)/S(In) within the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles at baseline preoperative and at postoperative 1-year follow-up MR imaging. Preoperative fat fractions in the failed-repair group and the intact-repair group were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results The preoperative fat fractions in the supraspinatus muscle were significantly higher in the failed-repair group than in the intact-repair group (37.0% vs 19.5%, P < .001). Fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle tended to progress at 1 year postoperatively in only the failed-repair group. Conclusion MR imaging quantification of preoperative fat fractions by using a two-point Dixon sequence within the rotator cuff muscles may be a viable method for predicting postoperative retear.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the national rates of failed primary rotator cuff repair (RCR) requiring revision repair, using numerous patient characteristics previously defined in orthopaedic literature, including smoking history, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLD), vitamin D deficiency, and osteoporosis to determine which factors independently affect the success of primary RCR. METHODS: A combined public and private national insurance database was searched from 2007 to 2016 for all patients who underwent RCR. Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify RCRs. Laterality modifiers for the primary surgery were used to identify subsequent revision RCRs. All patients who did not have a linked laterality modifier for the RCR Current Procedural Terminology code were excluded from the study. Basic demographics were recorded. International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision codes were used to identify patient characteristics including Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking status, DM, obesity, HLD, vitamin D deficiency, and osteoporosis. Patient age categorized as <60, 60-69, 70-74, or 75+ years old. Dichotomous data were analyzed with chi<sup>2</sup> testing. Multivariable logistic regression was used to characterize independent associations with revision RCR. RESULTS: Included in the study were 41,467 patients (41,844 shoulders, 52.7% male patients) who underwent primary arthroscopic RCR. Of all arthroscopic RCRs, 3072 patients (3463 shoulders, 53.5% male patients) underwent revision RCR (8.38%). In both primary and revision RCR, patients age 60 to 69 years were most prevalent, accounting for 38.4% and 37.6% of the cohorts, respectively. The average time from primary RCR to revision was 414.9 days (median 214.0 days). Increasing age and male sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, P = .019, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.19) were significantly predictive of revision RCR. Of the remaining patient characteristics, smoking most strongly predicted revision RCR (OR 1.36, P < .001, CI 1.23-1.49). Obesity (OR 1.32, P < .001, CI 1.21-1.43), hyperlipidemia (OR 1.09, P = .032, CI 1.01-1.18), and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.18, P < .001, CI 1.08-1.28) also increased risk of revision RCR significantly. DM was found to be protective against revision surgery (OR 0.84, P < .001, CI 0.76-0.92). Overall comorbidity burden as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index was not predictive of revision RCR. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking, obesity, vitamin D deficiency, and HLD are shown to be independent risk factors for failure of primary RCR requiring revision RCR. However, despite the suggestions of previous studies, DM, osteoporosis, and overall comorbidity burden did not demonstrate independent associations in this study. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, Case Series.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical results and integrity of arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears using the suture bridge technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-six shoulders with total thickness rotator cuff tears were assessed. Mean follow-up was 19 months. Repair integrity was analyzed postoperatively with imaging and recovery times. RESULTS: The University of California at Los Angeles scale was used during the followup; the preoperative mean improved from 13.2 points to 29.7 (p\001). The rotator cuff healed completely in 66.7 of the 56 shoulders. The incidence of fatty regeneration of rotator cuff muscles was more common in individuals > 60 years of age (p = 0.002). The latter had a higher chance of recurrent tear (p\001). DISCUSSION: There was significant pain relief in the visual analogue scale and improvement in ranges of motion. The advantages of this technique include that it allows immobilizing with a sling without the need for maximum abduction protection; it is a safer repair due to the configuration of the double band intercrossed over the tendon that provides greater fixation and stability, with greater coverage of the tear defect.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the relationship between functional outcomes and postoperative cuff integrity (anatomic outcome), and to reveal the factors affecting outcomes of rotator cuff repair. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients who had undergone repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tear received both computed tomographic arthrography (CTA) and functional evaluation a minimum of 1 year after surgery. The mean follow-up period was 19.6 months (range, 12 to 39 months). Anatomic outcome was evaluated by CTA. Functional outcomes were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and satisfaction with the operation, Constant score, simple shoulder test (SST), and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. Various clinical and structural factors were included for statistical analysis. RESULTS: All patients displayed significant improvement in all functional evaluations at the final visit. Functional outcome did not correlate with anatomic outcome (P > .05). A few variables did relate to functional outcome: female or old age statistically correlated with the score of SST, and the size of the tear correlated with the ASES score (P < .05). The retear was influenced by age, fatty degeneration of the cuff muscles, and the size of tear. Fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus was the most independent predictor of anatomic outcome on multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Rotator cuff repair brought significant functional improvement. However, the functional outcome did not correlate with the anatomic outcome. The fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus muscle served as an independent predictor of the postoperative integrity of the rotator cuff. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, prognostic case series.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are numerous reports on the outcome of rotator cuff repair according to age. However, the results are conflicting and driven by univariate analysis, which is not free of confounding factors. HYPOTHESIS: Age does not affect the anatomical and functional outcomes of rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one men and 96 women underwent rotator cuff repair at one institution and received computed tomography arthrography and functional evaluations at least 1 year after surgery. Various structural and clinical features according to age were evaluated. The correlation was assessed between age and outcomes, with adjustment for the preoperative score. RESULTS: Patient mean age was 60.0 +/- 8.7 years. The mean ages were higher in women, nonsmokers, and those with positive paradoxical abduction, lower level of sports activity, the presence of biceps injury, higher fatty degeneration in cuff muscles, inferior isokinetic muscle performance, bigger tear size, more retraction of tear, and symptomatic acromioclavicular arthritis. For the integrity of the repair, the mean age was higher in the retear group (31.1%) than in the intact group (68.9%)-that is, 63.7 +/- 7.5 and 58.4 +/- 8.7 years, respectively (P <.001). Only the Constant score exhibited a positive correlation with age after adjustment (P = .009). Univariate regression analysis revealed that a 0.313-point increment of Constant score could be expected for each year of age. CONCLUSION: On univariate analysis, older age was related with poor postoperative integrity and better functional improvement in Constant score. Multivariate regression revealed that age was not an independent determinant for anatomical or functional outcome whereas the tear retraction and fatty degeneration of the infraspinatus were independent factors for the integrity of repair and the presence of the paradoxical abduction and abduction torque of the unaffected shoulder for the Constant score.

AB  - The predictability of early postoperative ultrasonography (USG) for evaluating the structural integrity of repaired rotator cuffs is still unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the predictability of early USG performed 3 and 6 months postoperatively with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 1 year after arthroscopic cuff repair for structural failure. Among 213 patients who had arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery in 2013, one hundred thirty-eight patients who underwent USG between 3 and 6 months postoperatively and MRI at 1 year postoperatively were enrolled; the postoperative MRI findings were the reference standard used for the comparison. One hundred one patients who were examined using USG at 3 months postoperatively were allocated to group A, and 108 patients who had USG at 6 months postoperatively were allocated to group B. All diagnostic values, including positive and negative predictabilities, were calculated by 2-way tables. To compare the sensitivity and specificity between groups A and B, the area under the curve was calculated from the receiver operator characteristic curve for each group. The positive predictability values were 86.36% and 93.51% for USG at 3 and 6 months postoperatively, respectively. The negative values were 84.21% and 95.83%, respectively. The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves for groups A and B were 0.853 and 0.947, respectively (P=.048). Although the predictability of a single USG at 3 months postoperatively reached approximately 85%, USG evaluation at 6 months postoperatively might be relevant for predicting structural failure after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the effect of teriparatide, a recombinant human parathyroid hormone, on rotator cuff healing after arthroscopic repair compared with patients who were not treated with teriparatide. METHODS: This was a prospective propensity-matched study. Thirty-one patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for tears >2 cm in size between January 2015 and June 2016 were recruited (group I). Daily subcutaneous injections of teriparatide 20 mug were administered for 3 months following surgery. In the same period, propensity score matching (1-to-4) was performed to generate an untreated control group undergoing rotator cuff repair alone (group II) with the same tear size. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of tendon healing was performed at least 1 year postoperatively, as well as the range of shoulder motion, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score, and simple shoulder test. RESULTS: There was no significant difference of the retraction size, the anterior to posterior dimension of torn rotator cuff, or the preoperative bone mineral density in groups I and II (P = .78, .87, and .96, respectively). The rate of retear was significantly lower in group I than in group II (16% vs 33.9%; P = .04). Range of motion and functional scores were not significantly different between the 2 groups (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Teriparatide, a recombinant human parathyroid hormone, can be a systemic treatment option that significantly enhances the tendon-to-bone healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for patients with rotator cuff tears >2 cm. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the arthroscopic double-layer lasso loop repair technique for delaminated posterosuperior rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Forty-one patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a delaminated posterosuperior rotator cuff tear by the double-layer lasso loop technique. Their preoperative and postoperative clinical and functional scores were compared to evaluate surgical outcomes. The prerequisite for inclusion was a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. We excluded patients with a history of shoulder surgery before the double-layer lasso loop repair. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements (P < .001) were found in the Constant score (54 vs 83) and University of California, Los Angeles functional score (6.4 vs 9.5). Pain and strength improved according to the Jobe test, bear-hug test, belly-press test, Gerber lift-off test, and external rotation test (P < .001). No significant difference in strength was noted between the operated and nonoperated sides. There was only 1 complete rerupture (3.1%), whereas 5 patients (15.6%) had partial ruptures. CONCLUSIONS: The arthroscopic double-layer lasso loop repair technique for delaminated posterosuperior rotator cuff tears is an effective procedure. Our series showed a low rerupture rate. At a mean follow-up of 44 months, postoperative recovery with resultant functional, pain, and patient satisfaction scores was good to excellent and was comparable with the nonoperated side. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, case series.

AB  - Background: The effect of the acromion index (AI) and critical shoulder angle (CSA) on the short-term healing rate after arthroscopic repair of the supraspinatus tendons is already known. Long-term effects have not been published yet. Purpose: Long-term evaluation of the effect of the AI and CSA on the postoperative healing rate and clinical results after arthroscopic repair of the supraspinatus tendon. Methods: Patients with a symptomatic, single-tendon, full-thickness supraspinatus tear in whom nonoperative management had failed were treated with an arthroscopic repair. Preoperative radiographs were used to measure CSA and AI. Eight years postoperatively, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were performed and evaluated on repair integrity. Patient-reported outcome measurements were collected pre- and postoperatively. Results: Thirty-one patients were evaluated 8 years postoperatively. The mean age at the time of surgery was 61 +/- 9 years. MRI evaluation showed that 20 patients (65%) had an intact repair and 11 (35%) had a full-thickness retear. No significant differences were found between the intact and retear groups regarding age (P = .605), initial tear size (P = .485), retraction grade (P = .439), and all PROMs. The mean CSA for the intact group (33degree +/- 1degree) was significantly lower than the CSA in the retear group (38degree +/- 1degree; P = .004). Eighteen patients (58%) had a CSA >=35degree, and 9 (50%) among them had a retear and 9 (50%) had an intact repair. The mean AI for the intact group (0.72 +/- 0.11) was significantly lower than the AI in the retear group (0.81 +/- 0.08 ; P = .021). Seventeen patients (55%) had an AI >=0.75, and 9 (53%) among them had a retear and 8 had an intact repair. If the AI was >=0.75, the odds ratio of having a retear was 6.19 (P = .045). No progressive worsening of PROMs and clinical results could be demonstrated related to a higher CSA or AI during the entire follow-up. Conclusion: At long-term follow-up, a higher CSA has the tendency to have an increased rate of retear after arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair, but this was not significant. A higher AI significantly increased the retear risk. A higher CSA and AI did not impair the clinical results over time. An AI >=0.75 was associated with a 6-fold increase in risk of retear after arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technical advances have allowed arthroscopic rotator cuff repair to supplant open repairs with similar outcomes. However, few data exist to support the theoretical decrease in complications with the arthroscopic technique. METHODS: We used the Veterans Administration Surgical Quality Improvement Program database from the entire U.S. Veterans Administration system. We obtained perioperative data of all patients undergoing rotator cuff repair between 2003 and 2008. Single and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors for perioperative complications associated with rotator cuff surgery. RESULTS: There were 6975 open rotator cuff repairs and 2918 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs performed with similar patient age, gender breakdown, body mass index, and comorbidities. Complications occurred in the early postoperative period in 2.1% of the open repair group and 0.9% of the arthroscopic repair group (P < .0001). The prevalence of both superficial and deep wound infection was higher in the open group compared with the arthroscopic group (1% vs. 0.1% superficial, P < .0001; 0.3% vs. 0.1% deep, P = .11). Return to the operating room within the 30-day surveillance period occurred in 1.1% of the open repair patients compared with 0.5% of patients undergoing arthroscopic repairs (P < .0001). -Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the arthroscopic group had a significantly lower risk of complications (P = .0001), a lower rate of superficial infection (P = .0002), a lower incidence of return to the operating room within 30 days (P = .007), and a lower risk of hospital readmission (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in the veteran population resulted in a lower incidence of perioperative complications compared with open repair.

AB  - Introduction: Current evidence is controversial about the outcomes after the repair of the delaminated versus nondelaminated rotator cuff tears. The objective of this study was to evaluate the factors affecting delamination of the cuff and clinical and structural outcomes after en masse arthroscopic repair of delaminated versus nondelaminated cuff of varying sizes. Materials and Methods: A total of 233 patients with full-thickness posterosuperior cuff tears were divided in two groups: Group 1: Delaminated tears (n = 131) and Group 2: Nondelaminated tears (n = 102) of medium, large, and massive sizes. Both groups were evaluated by clinical scores (Constant-Murley [CM], American shoulder and elbow score [ASES]) and ultrasonography (USG), at a minimum followup of 2 years. Results: The mean followup was 45.47 months. There was a weak but statistically significant linear correlation (P = 0.02) between the increasing size of tear and delamination, whereas increasing age and duration of symptoms did not correlate with increasing tendency of delamination. Final followup USG analysis revealed that there was no significant difference (P = 0.55) between healing rates of Group 1 and Group 2. Further taking various tear sizes into account, USG revealed no significant difference between the healing rates of two groups. The mean overall final postoperative CM and ASES scores of two groups did not show any significant difference (CM; P = 0.36, ASES; P = 0.4). However, the clinical outcome was significantly better in the completely healed group as compared to partially healed or retear group. Conclusions: A weak linear correlation between delamination and increasing size of the tear was noted. Although overall structural and clinical outcome is no different between two groups, the clinical outcomes of completely healed tear are better than partially healed ones. Level of Evidence: Level III, Retrospective comparative.

AB  - We hypothesize that cigarette smoking might predispose patients to the development of shoulder stiffness as a postoperative complication of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair within the first 3 months of operative intervention. To our knowledge this association has not been evaluated before. The study was a prospective study undertaken on a consecutive cohort of 80 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at a single center. Measurements of passive range of motion, patient-ranked pain and stiffness levels, as well as strength were collected preoperatively and at 1, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Patient smoking habits were assessed at the time of their 6-week postoperative review. Correlation analysis demonstrated a relationship between smoking status and patient-ranked shoulder stiffness 1 week following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (r=0.26, P=0.046). Smoking status also correlated with the change in shoulder stiffness experienced by smokers at 1 week (r=0.37, P=0.03) and was found to be associated with a reduced restoration of external rotation range of motion between 6 and 12 weeks following arthroscopic intervention (r=-0.32, P=0.014). Relationships exist between cigarette smoking, patient reported shoulder stiffness and an objective loss of range of motion within 12 weeks of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Biomechanical studies suggest a suture bridge technique enhances rotator cuff tendon footprint contact area, holding strength, and mean contact pressure. Based on these studies, we asked whether (1) the suture bridge technique would provide a high rate of cuff integrity after surgery, (2) the status of the repaired cuff would change with time, (3) preoperative factors could predict postoperative cuff integrity, and (4) patients with retears had less favorable pain, functional scores, range of motion (ROM), and muscle strength compared with those with intact repairs. We prospectively followed 78 patients with arthroscopic repairs in whom we used the suture bridge technique. The integrity of the rotator cuff repair was determined using ultrasonographic evaluation at 4.5 and 12 months after surgery. Ultrasonography revealed intact cuffs in 91% at 4.5 months postoperatively, all of which were maintained at the 12-month followup. Failure rates were 17.6% (three of 17) for massive tears, 11.1% (two of 18) for large tears, 6.3% (two of 32) for medium tears, and no failures for small tears. Preoperative fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus muscle was a strong predictor of cuff integrity. We found no correlation between the integrity and clinical outcomes except for a temporary decrease of abduction strength at 6 months. Arthroscopic repair using suture bridge technique can achieve a low retear rate in shoulders treated for rotator cuff tears, but the occurrence of retear did not influence the outcome. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For large-sized tears of the rotator cuff, data according to the tear shape have not yet been reported for repair methodology, configuration, and subsequent integrity. HYPOTHESIS: The retear rate after the repair of large mobile tears, such as crescent- or L-shaped tears, is believed to be lower compared with retear rates after the repair of large U-shaped tears that are accompanied by anterior or posterior leaves of the rotator cuff. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Data were collected and analyzed from 95 consecutive patients with a large-sized rotator cuff tear who underwent arthroscopic suture-bridge repair. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those having crescent- or L-shaped tears (mobile tear group, 53 patients) and those having U-shaped tears (U-shaped tear group, 42 patients). The integrity of the repaired constructs was determined by ultrasonography at 4.5, 12, and 24 months. Moreover, clinical evaluations were performed by using the Constant score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and muscle strength at intervals of 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS: On ultrasonography at 4.5, 12, and 24 months, a retear was detected in 6, 2, and 1 patients in the mobile tear group and in 5, 2, and 1 patients in the U-shaped tear group, respectively. Significant differences in retear rates were not detected between the groups overall or at each time point. Moreover, clinical scores were similar between groups, except for the presence of a temporarily higher Constant score at 12 months in the mobile tear group. With regard to shoulder strength, between-group comparisons indicated no statistically significant difference, either in abduction or external rotation, except for the presence of temporarily higher external rotation strength at 3 months in the mobile tear group. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair of large-sized rotator cuff tears yielded substantial improvements in shoulder function, regardless of tear retraction, during midterm follow-up. Moreover, the findings did not indicate significant differences in retear rates between the repair of crescent- or L-shaped tears and that of U-shaped tears either overall or at a particular time point.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In spite of the high prevalence of shoulder stiffness during rotator cuff repair, optimal management remains unclear. PURPOSE: To identify the effect of capsular release during rotator cuff repair on the outcomes of patients with both shoulder stiffness and a rotator cuff tear, based on subgroup analyses. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients (mean age, 61.5 +/- 8.3 years) were enrolled who underwent arthroscopic repair of a small- to large-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tear and manipulation for concomitant shoulder stiffness (passive forward flexion <=120degree, external rotation at the side <=45degree). The first 21 consecutive patients underwent manipulation alone to treat stiffness; the second 28 consecutive patients underwent capsular release with manipulation. Among the 49 patients, 25 showed severe stiffness (forward flexion <=100degree, external rotation at the side <=30degree; 11 in the first series and 14 in the second series), and 15 had diabetes mellitus (30.6%; 6 in the first series and 9 in the second series). Shoulder range of motion was measured 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively and at final follow-up visit. Simultaneously, functional outcome was evaluated by visual analog scale for pain, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Constant score, and muscle strength ratio (involved/uninvolved), and cuff integrity was assessed ultrasonographically at least 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: All range of motion measurements, functional scores, and muscle strength ratios significantly improved postoperatively regardless of the treatment method of stiffness. No outcome measure differed significantly between patients who did and did not undergo capsular release, regardless of the severity of stiffness, except for a temporary improvement in external rotation at side 3 months postoperatively in favor of those who underwent capsular release in cases with severe stiffness. Among patients with diabetes mellitus however, those who underwent capsular release showed greater improvement in forward flexion after 3 months and 1 year and in external rotation at the side for all time points (all P < .05), except for 6 weeks postoperatively; these patients also had a significantly higher final American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (P = .03). Of 21 patients who underwent manipulation alone and of 28 who underwent capsular release and manipulation, 2 and 1 developed retears, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both manipulation and capsular release with manipulation significantly improved range of motion and produced satisfactory functional outcomes. The outcomes did not differ between treatment methods for stiffness regardless of the severity of stiffness. In patients with diabetes mellitus however, capsular release at the time of rotator cuff repair seems to be beneficial, especially for external rotation and final postoperative function.

AB  - PURPOSE: Various researchers have observed small areas of osteolysis after using bioabsorbable anchors in shoulder surgeries. The purpose of this study is to determine whether radiographic perianchor radiolucent rings after rotator cuff repair are associated with the failure of repair and also assess their clinical implications. Further, the most frequent location of the radiolucent rings in the double-row suture bridge configuration was also assessed. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by suture bridge technique were retrospectively evaluated radiographically and clinically. The number and size of the rings that appeared at each follow-up were recorded. Also, the locations of each ring were recorded as anterior, middle or posterior, and medial or lateral according to the construct of the anchors used for suture bridge technique. The size of the tear, the number of anchors used and age of the patients were compared. Re-tear rates according to ultrasound examinations were also analyzed. RESULTS: After rotator cuff repair, the mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score increased from 46.7 to 88.0 and the overall re-tear rate was 8.5% (11 cases). Seventy-three patients (56.6%) showed RR (total number of 99 rings) at least once during the course of their follow-up and the rings appeared at a mean period of 18.2 months after surgery. Mean size of the rings initially was 5.6 mm and the rings increased or decreased in mean size of 0.4 mm during mean follow-up of 37 months. No correlation was seen with the number of RRs and the rate of re-tears, number of anchors, size of tears, and clinical outcome as determined by the ASES score. Radiolucent ring measurement reproducibility was confirmed by independent, repeated measurements. The rings appeared mostly at anteromedial anchors (75 rings, 75.8%) and the authors suggest that mechanical factors may play a role for the cause of radiolucent rings. CONCLUSIONS: The number and the size of RRs around bioabsorbable anchors after rotator cuff repair do not appear to adversely affect the healing and clinical outcome of ARCR. Most radiolucent rings appeared at anteromedial anchors, indicating that mechanical factors may play a role for the radiolucencies. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Case series, level IV.

AB  - PURPOSE: Fatty infiltration (FI) is known to be an irreversible change which continues degeneration after rotator cuff repair. Previous studies evaluated postoperative changes in FI using a preoperative baseline. This study aimed to investigate the changes in FI using an immediate postoperative baseline. We hypothesized that FI was progressed more when measured relative to an immediate postoperative baseline than to a preoperative baseline. METHODS: From 2008 to 2010, 77 patients who met the following criteria were included in this study: arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of a full-thickness rotator cuff tear and presence of preoperative (approximately 1 month before surgery), immediate postoperative (approximately 3 days after surgery), and 1-year postoperative (at least 9 months to 1 year after surgery) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undertaken. The exclusion criteria were: absence of any of the three MRIs, isolated subscapularis repair, and rotator cuff repair with margin convergence only. The MRIs were examined to assess the Goutallier grade of the rotator cuff muscles for the assessment of FI. Structural integrity was evaluated using the Sugaya classification. Measurements 1 year after surgery were compared with those at the preoperative and immediate postoperative time points according to the integrity. RESULTS: In the total and retear group, FI in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus 1 year after surgery did not change significantly relative to the preoperative baseline (all n.s.), but progressed compared to the immediate postoperative baseline (all p < 0.001). In the retear group, FI in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus reduced for seven and two of 20 patients, respectively, compared with the preoperative baseline; however, no patients showed a reduced FI compared with the immediate postoperative baseline. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed that the changes in FI reduced, remained or progressed in accordance with the baseline and structural integrity. FI progressed when compared with the immediate postoperative baseline than with the preoperative baseline. The immediate postoperative time point would be considered as the baseline to monitor the true changes of FI after repair. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective comparative study, Level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No study to date has directly evaluated rotator cuff repair results among smokers. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether smoking affects healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair through propensity score matching (PSM). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Among 249 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, 34 current heavy smokers were selected with a smoking history >20 pack-years (mean +/- SD pack-years, 33.91 +/- 12.13). Characteristics between current heavy smokers and nonsmokers were compared. According to the PSM technique, 34 nonsmokers were selected after 1:1 matching for age, fatty infiltration, and tear size-the main prognostic factors of outcomes after rotator cuff repair. Each patient's outcome evaluation was completed anatomically at a minimum of 6 months (magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography) and functionally at a minimum of 1 year (pain visual analog scale, range of motion, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Constant, University of California, Los Angeles, and Simple Shoulder Test scores), and every outcome was analyzed in the matched smoker and nonsmoker groups. RESULTS: Current heavy smokers had a higher incidence of male sex ( P < .001), heavy manual work ( P = .025), high bone density ( P = .036), and poor tendinosis grade ( P = .028). After adjustment for the confounding variables by PSM, the matched smoker group showed a significantly higher healing failure rate than the matched nonsmoker group (29.4% vs 5.9%, P = .023). However, we failed to detect significant differences in the functional outcomes between the matched groups ( P > .05). CONCLUSION: Smoking affected healing failure after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Attention should be paid to smokers, especially current heavy smokers, in cases of rotator cuff repair surgery.

AB  - Background: Delaminated rotator cuff tear is known to be a degenerative tear having a negative prognostic effect. This study undertook to compare the anatomical and clinical outcomes of delaminated tears and single layer tears. Methods: Totally, 175 patients with medium to large rotator cuff tears enrolled for the study were divided into 2 groups, based on the tear pathology: single layer tear (group 1) and delaminated tear (group 2). Preoperatively, length of the remnant tendon, muscle atrophy of supraspinatus (SS), and fatty degeneration of SS and infraspinatus (IS) muscles were assessed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For follow-up, the repair integrity of the rotator cuff was evaluated by ultrasonography. Clinical outcomes were assessed by evaluating the Constant score (CS) and Korean Shoulder Score (KSS). Results: Retears were detected in 6 cases of group 1 (6.5%) and 11 cases of group 2 (13.3%). Although higher in group 2, the retear rate was significantly not different (p=0.133). Preoperative MRI revealed length of remnant tendon to be 15.46 +/- 3.60 mm and 14.17 +/- 3.16 mm (p=0.013), and muscle atrophy of SS (occupation ratio) was 60.54 +/- 13.15 and 56.55 +/- 12.88 (p=0.045), in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Fatty degeneration of SS and IS in both groups had no significant differences. Postoperatively, no significant differences were observed for CS and KSS values between the groups. Conclusions: Delaminated rotator cuff tears showed shorter remnant tendon length and higher muscle atrophy that correlate to a negative prognosis. These prognostic effects should be considered during delaminated rotator cuff tear treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of coracohumeral ligament (CHL) release from the coracoid process concomitant with arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for preventing postoperative stiffness. METHODS: Data on patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with a minimum follow-up of 1 year were collected retrospectively. Propensity score matching (1-to-1) was performed between a no-releasing group (Group I) and CHL-releasing group (Group II). In total, 76 patients in each group were matched. Clinical outcomes were assessed and compared between the two groups, including range of motion (ROM) and visual analogue scale for pain (pVAS) at postoperative 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The integrity of the repaired tendon was assessed at 1-year follow-up using either magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography. RESULTS: External rotation (ER) at side at postoperative 3 months in Group II was better than that in Group I (48.6degree +/- 11.6degree vs. 38.4degree +/- 13.0degree, P < 0.001). When evaluating only patients with a small-to-medium sized tear at postoperative 3 months, ER at side was 49.8degree +/- 10.9degree in Group II versus 37.8degree +/- 13.1degree in Group I (P < 0.001). In patients with a large-to-massive sized tear, however, there was no significant difference in ER at side at postoperative 3 months (n.s.). There was no significant difference in ROM and functional scores at postoperative 6 months and 1 year, and there was no significant difference in healing failure rate (6 cases in Group I (7.9%), 2 cases in Group II (2.6%); n.s.). No complications of the CHL release procedure occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, CHL release from the coracoid process without creating a rotator interval defect could be an effective and safe method to prevent early postoperative stiffness, especially ER at side in patients with a small-to-medium sized tear. Therefore, CHL release can be used as a selective procedure to prevent postoperative stiffness in patients that may benefit from this procedure with decreased preoperative ER compared to the normal side. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesized in this study that the characteristics of retear cases vary according to surgeon volume and that surgical outcomes differ between primary and revision arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (revisional ARCR). METHODS: Surgeons performing more than 12 rotator cuff repairs (RCRs) per year were defined as high-volume surgeons, and those performing fewer than 12 RCRs were considered low-volume surgeons. Of the 47 patients who underwent revisional ARCR at our clinic enrolled in this study, 21 cases were treated by high-volume surgeons and 26 cases by low-volume surgeons. In all cases, the interval between primary surgery and revisional ARCR, degree of "acromial scuffing," number of anchors, RCR technique, retear pattern, fatty infiltration, retear size, operating time, and clinical outcome were recorded. RESULTS: During primary surgery, significantly more lateral anchors (p=0.004) were used, and the rate of use of the double-row repair technique was significantly higher (p<0.001) in the high- versus low-volume surgeon group. Moreover, the "cut-through pattern" was observed significantly more frequently among the cases treated by high- versus low-volume surgeons (p=0.008). The clinical outcomes after revisional ARCR were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Double-row repair during primary surgery and the cut-through pattern during revisional ARCR were more frequent in the high- versus low-volume surgeon groups. However, no differences in retear site or size, fatty infiltration grade, or outcomes were observed between the groups.

AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Conservative rehabilitation after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair does not result in long-term stiffness and improves rates of tendon healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 43 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears who underwent a standardized, conservative protocol of full-time sling immobilization without formal therapy for 6 weeks after arthroscopic repair. At 6 to 8 weeks of follow-up, we categorized patients as "stiff" if they demonstrated forward elevation of less than 100degree and external rotation of less than 30degree passively; all others were designated "nonstiff." Active range of motion in forward elevation, external rotation, and internal rotation was assessed at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant-Murley scores were assessed at 1 year. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained in all patients to assess tendon healing. RESULTS: Ten patients (23%) were considered stiff after rotator cuff surgery. At 1 year, there was no difference in mean forward elevation (166degree vs 161degree, P = .2), external rotation (62degree vs. 58.4degree, P = .5), or internal rotation (T7.4 vs T8.2, P = .07) between the stiff and nonstiff groups, respectively. There were no differences in final ASES (83 vs 79, P = .57) and Constant-Murley scores (77 vs. 74, P = .5). Repeat MRI suggested a trend toward a lower retear rate among the stiff patients (70% intact in stiff group vs 36% in nonstiff group, P = .079). Two clinically significant cuff retears occurred in the nonstiff cohort. DISCUSSION: Concerns for recalcitrant stiffness have led some to favor early postoperative therapy. We found that early restriction of motion did not lead to long-term stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, even in patients who were clinically stiff in the early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS: Sling immobilization for 6 weeks after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair does not result in increased long-term stiffness and may improve the rate of tendon healing.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to determine if delay (before or after 4 months) in repairing a symptomatic traumatic rotator cuff tear affected clinical outcome, re-rupture rates and use of interpositional dermal grafts. METHODS: This was a case matched (age + tear size) series of patients who underwent an early (<= 4 months) or delayed (> 4 months) rotator cuff repair following a traumatic tear. If a direct repair could not be achieved a dermal interposition graft was used. Outcomes were collected at a median time of 30 months post-operatively using the Oxford, Constant and EQ5D scores. RESULTS: Twenty patients underwent rotator cuff repair within 4 months (1-4) of injury. Twenty age and cuff tear size-matched patients were identified who had undergone a delayed repair (4.1-24 months) after injury. We found no significant difference (p > 0.05) in patient reported outcomes scores between the early and delayed repair. [Oxford scores; Early 43(13-48), Delayed 45 (31-48); Constant scores; Early 73 (21-94), Delayed 73.5 (44-87); EQ5D; Early 0.75 (0.25-1), Delayed 0.77 (0.4-1)]. Time to full recovery was significantly longer (14 vs 33.8 months) for the delayed repair group (P > 0.05). When cuff tears were subdivided into < 3 cm tears or >= 3 cm tears, no significant difference outcome scores were founds. However, use of dermal interposition graft was 44% in delayed group for tears >= 3 cm. No grafts were used in early repair group. There was one symptomatic re-tear in our series which was in the early repair group. CONCLUSION: When compared to the delayed repair group, patients that underwent early repair of traumatic rotator cuff tears had shorter time of recovery, and less need for allograft augmentation for tears 3 cm or greater. However, at mid-term follow-up, this study found no difference in patient reported outcomes following early versus delayed repair of traumatic rotator cuff tears. Level of evidence: 3.

AB  - PURPOSE: Natural history of rotator cuff tears is poorly understood. Repair of rotator cuff tears has shown to improve functional outcomes in full-thickness tears. However, high re-tear rates have been reported in literature, which does not correlate with poorer outcomes. Primary aim of this study was to explore association between functional outcome scores and structural integrity of rotator cuff, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based grading. METHODS: Patients with MRI-proven full-thickness rotator cuff tears, undergoing mini-open rotator cuff repair, were assessed for shoulder abduction strength and functional outcome scores before the surgery and 2 years after the procedure. Association between functional outcome scores and MRI grading for rotator cuff healing (Sugaya grading) was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients (18 females and 20 males), with a mean age of 50.6 years (SD: 10.9), were included in the study. Mean duration of symptoms was 6.05 months (SD: 4.2). On postoperative MRI, healing of the cuff was categorized as Sugaya grade 1 in 12 patients, grade 2 in 20 patients and grade 3 in 6 patients. Higher Sugaya grades (T: 13.48, p: 0.001) and grades of fatty degeneration (T: 14.05, p: 0.001) were found to be associated with longer duration of symptoms. Improvement in shoulder abduction strength correlated negatively with the duration of symptoms (r: -0.39, p: 0.01). There was a significant improvement in functional outcome scores after the surgery. There was no association between postoperative structural integrity of the repaired tendon (Sugaya grading) and functional outcome scores. CONCLUSION: Early repair of rotator cuff results in better functional outcomes and shoulder strength. The findings from this study suggest there is a dissociation between MRI-based grades of healing of repaired rotator cuff and function of the shoulder. STUDY DESIGN: Level II, Prospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many clinical and radiographic studies suggest that patient age and sex have an influence on rotator cuff (RC) repair outcomes. However, these findings result from retrospective statistical analyses and cannot provide a causal answer. PURPOSE: To analyze whether age and sex influence the biological potential at the time of RC repair or midterm clinical and radiographic outcomes. Also assessed was the effect of the biological potential on intraindividual clinical/radiographic results. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 40 patients underwent arthroscopic RC repair. At the time of surgery (t = 0), supraspinatus tendon biopsy specimens were obtained, cultivated, and assessed for their biological potential, particularly (1) cell growth and (2) collagen type I production. After a follow-up at 24 months (t = 1), all patients were assessed by clinical scores (Constant score, subjective shoulder value, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score, and Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index [WORC] score) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging to determine RC integrity. The data were examined for age- and sex-related differences and to identify the correlation between biological potential (t = 0) and clinical/radiographic outcome (t = 1). RESULTS: The follow-up rate for the imaging and clinical evaluation was 100%. Age, but not sex, influenced the biological tendon cell parameters at t = 0. However, there was no effect of age or sex on the clinical and radiographic results at t = 1. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between the initial biological parameters and later clinical outcomes or radiographic RC integrity. Finally, there was no significant difference between intact and nonhealed repairs in terms of the respective clinical scores. CONCLUSION: Age, but not sex, was found to have a negative effect on RC tendon cell biology. However, neither sex nor, in particular, a higher age influenced repair outcomes after 24 months.

AB  - PURPOSE: The primary aim of the present study was to determine the incidence of infections following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in a single department over a 10-year period. Secondary goals included the evaluation of potential risk factors for infections and to investigate the efficacy of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in the reduction of infectious complications. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of 3294 all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs performed between 2004 and 2014 at a single institution was conducted to determine the rate of infection in all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. Detailed data including demographics, co-morbidities, initial surgical procedure, time from index surgery to infection, clinical presentation, isolated pathogens, and subsequent treatment were recorded of patients with infections. Univariate logistic regression was performed, and a multivariate model was developed to identify variables that were predictive of infections following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. RESULTS: The rate of infection was 8.5/1000 in whom rotator cuff repairs were performed (95 % CI 0.58-1.23 %) during the study period. The most commonly identified pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11, 39.3 %), followed by Propionibacterium acnes (n = 8, 28.6 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2, 7.1 %). Patients presented at our institution with signs of infection an average of 28.9 +/- 14.7 days after the index surgery. The leading symptom that was present in all patients was diffuse or localized shoulder pain, followed by local signs of infection in 19 (67.9 %), secretion in 14 (50 %), and fever in 9 (32.1 %) patients, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the male gender, age over 60, and duration of surgery over 90 min as predictive factors for infection. Administration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was an independent mitigating factor for postoperative infection and reduced the infection rate from 1.54 % (95 % CI 0.98-2.30 %) to 0.28 % (95 % CI 0.10-0.67 %). CONCLUSIONS: The overall incidence of infection was 8.5/1000 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs over a 10-year period. Gender, age, and length of surgery were identified as predictive factors for infection. The administration of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the overall risk of infection and is therefore recommended in all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. However, current prophylactic treatment strategies were not equally efficient for all types of pathogens. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective comparative study, Level III.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite rotator cuff repair techniques have developed significantly in last decade, pushed by the progress in technology and materials, the treatment of rotator cuff tears and re-tears is still a big challenge for shoulder surgeons. The aim of this study is to perform clinical and radiological evaluation (ultrasound and MRI) of patients treated with transosseous sharc-ft, and single row techniques for sovraspinatus rotator cuff tear at 6, 12 and 24 months follow up. METHODS: Twenty-eight consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic repair for rotator cuff tear were enrolled in the study and divided in two different groups: group A (14 patients) underwent a single row technique repair; group B (14 patients) underwent a transosseous sharc-ft technique repair. All participants had MRI or ultrasound examination confirmed fullthickness tears of sovraspinatus tendon before surgery. All the patients underwent clinical evaluation at 45 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 and 24 months post-operatively with VAS, Dash, Constant and ASES score. Diagnostic ultrasound examination was performed at 6 months follow up while the MRI examination at 1 and 2 year follow up. RESULTS: The whole primary variables didn't show any significant difference and the groups were homogenous (age, Goutallier fatty infiltration, VAS, DASH, Constant, ASES). Some statistically significant differences are visible at discrete variables in a specific time: Dash at 12 months and Constant at 24 months show a significant improvement versus single-row technique. CONCLUSION: The arthroscopic transosseous repair technique with sharc-ft showed excellent results with little significant statically difference between this technique and the single row for this kind of lesion after 1 year of follow-up. Clinical data from this study confirmed, with the help of ultrasound examination and MRI, the excellent clinical outcome obtained by the patients. Further studies are needed to find differences between these techniques in the repair of large and massive rotator cuff lesions. (www.actabiomedica.it).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the outcomes after repair of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome after repair of partial-thickness rotator cuff tears compared with full-thickness tears. Our hypothesis was that repair of partial-thickness tears leads to more shoulder stiffness but fewer retears compared with repair of full-thickness tears. METHODS: A group of 105 consecutive patients who had a full-thickness tear measuring <3 cm2 was compared with a group of sixty-four patients who had a partial-thickness tear. All tears were repaired with use of a knotless single-row arthroscopic repair. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and standardized patient and examiner-determined outcomes were obtained preoperatively and at six, twelve, and twenty-four weeks and at two years after surgery. Rotator cuff integrity was determined by ultrasound examination at six months and two years after surgery. RESULTS: Examiner-determined postoperative stiffness at six weeks was common in both groups (50% of those with a partial-thickness tear and 47% of those with a full-thickness tear) but was decreased compared with preoperative findings in both groups to 21% and 19%, respectively, at three months and to 15% and 14% at six months. The ultrasound-determined retear rate was small (5% in the partial-thickness group and 10% in the full-thickness group) at six months, but increased to 10% and 20%, respectively, at twenty-four months. The ASES score, patient-determined overall shoulder function, and all pain scores were superior to preoperative scores at six months (p < 0.001) and at twenty-four months (p < 0.001) in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic repair of partial-thickness and small and medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears was associated with excellent medium-term clinical outcomes with low retear rates. The data did not support our hypothesis: the differences in retear rate and postoperative shoulder stiffness rate found between the two groups did not reach significance.

AB  - Introduction: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using the double-row technique is associated with improved anatomical results. The aim of our study was to compare clinical and structural results after arthroscopic reconstruction. Methods: A total of 40 patients with a mid-size tear were included. Intraoperatively, the rupture location and size, rupture shape and retraction were documented. All patients underwent an evaluation after 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. The MRI examination was performed using a standard protocol in a low-field MRI. The tendon integrity, signal intensity in tendon and bursae, the size of the bone edemas, signal characteristics of the anchors, and muscular atrophy, and fatty degeneration were determined. Results: All patients had problems including some pain at the 6-week follow-up. the Constant Murley score (34 points) was lower than that recorded preoperatively (52 points). In the MRI, one re-rupture was identified. After 12 weeks, the Constant Murley score showed an explicit increase (from 52 to 61 points). In addition, patients were able to achieve their preoperative force levels on average. All patients experienced some degree of pain relief. After 26 weeks, the Constant Murley score had risen to 79 points. The signal intensity in tendons and bursae, and the bone edemas had normalized. Conclusions: Arthroscopic double-row repair of rotator cuff tears is a safe procedure, the structural results in the MRI correlated with the clinical results. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

AB  - PURPOSE: The current study was designed to evaluate the rate of osteolysis and the clinical and functional outcomes in patients who underwent mini-open rotator cuff repairs using first generation bioabsorbable suture anchors. Our hypothesis was that patients with osteolysis noted on post-repair MRI would have an accompanying decrease in functional and clinical patient outcomes when compared with patients who did not have osteolysis evident on post-repair MRI. TYPE OF STUDY: Clinical retrospective study. METHODS: Between September 2000 and May 2004, 76 patients were repaired using first generation Bio-Corkscrew suture anchors (Arthrex, Naples, FL). 30 patients were available for complete follow-up evaluation. The mean follow-up time was 36 months (range 24-58). Patients were assessed with the Constant-Murley Score, radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Post-operative strength was measured using an Isokinetic Cybex-Dynamometer. 14 patients had osteolysis evident on MRI (Group A) while 16 patients did not have osteolysis on MRI (Group B). RESULTS: In both groups, a total of 70 bio-anchors were used. 22 anchors showed osteolytic changes on MRI (Group A). Concerning ROM, there was no statistical difference in both groups. The Constant-Score was statistically not different in both groups A (92.4) and B (83.7). On MRI-scans, there were repair failures in both groups (A, 2 reruptures; B, 3 reruptures). CONCLUSIONS: Although, we found a high rate of osteolysis after rotator cuff repair with bioabsorbable anchors, these results did not change the clinical outcomes after rotator cuff repair. Recurrent tears were not significantly different in both groups and are comparable to rerupture rates in prior studies. More studies are needed to verify the effect of osteolysis over the long term.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical and radiologic results after arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair (TORCR). METHODS: A total of 69 patients with full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears with or without infraspinatus tendon tears treated with arthroscopic TORCR by a single surgeon between 1998 and 2003 were included. Among them, 56 patients (81%) with a mean age of 58 +/- 5 years (range, 42-70 years) were available for final follow-up examination after an average of 15 +/- 2 years (range, 12-18 years). The Subjective Shoulder Value, Constant score (CS), University of California at Los Angeles score, and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score were recorded. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to visualize tendon integrity in 66% of patients. RESULTS: At final follow-up, the mean CS was 84 +/- 8 points; mean University of California at Los Angeles score, 33 +/- 2 points; mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, 92 +/- 10 points; and mean Subjective Shoulder Value, 89% +/- 17%. MRI revealed asymptomatic repair failure in 9 patients (27%). Moreover, 4 patients (7%) underwent revision surgery because of a symptomatic rerupture, resulting in an overall retear rate of 33%. Patients with intact repairs at final follow-up showed a significantly higher CS (P = .019) and abduction strength (P = .016) than patients with retears. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic TORCR for the treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears provided good clinical results 12 to 18 years after surgery. Cuff integrity on follow-up MRI scans had a positive effect on the clinical outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of patient age on functional improvement after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) is still a matter of debate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical midterm results after ARCR in patients who were 75 years or older at the time of surgery. METHODS: A total of 31 shoulders in 30 patients older than 75 years at the time of surgery underwent ARCR for a degenerative full-thickness rotator cuff tear (RCT) between 2010 and 2016. Among those, 23 shoulders in 22 patients (74%) with a mean age at time of surgery of 77 +/- 2 years (range, 75-82 years) were followed up after a mean of 7 +/- 2 years (range, 3-9 years). Clinical assessment included the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index as well as patient satisfaction, the Subjective Shoulder Value (SSV), Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) score. RESULTS: Overall, patient satisfaction was excellent, as everybody stated to be very satisfied with the surgery. Neither any complication nor revision surgery occurred during the study period. At final follow-up, the mean WORC index was 88% +/- 15%. The mean SSV was comparable between the affected shoulder (90% +/- 15%) and the contralateral side (87% +/- 15%) (P = .235). The mean SST score was 10 +/- 2 points and the mean ASES score was 89 +/- 17 points. CONCLUSION: ARCR for symptomatic RCTs without advanced muscle degeneration in patients older than 75 years at the time of surgery provided good clinical results and high patient satisfaction at midterm follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) with suture anchor-based fixation techniques has replaced former open and mini-open approaches. Nevertheless, long-term studies are scarce, and lack of knowledge exists about whether single-row (SR) or double-row (DR) methods are superior in clinical and anatomic results. PURPOSE: To analyze long-term results after arthroscopic RCR in patients with symptomatic rotator cuff tears and to compare functional and radiographic outcomes between SR and DR repair techniques at least 10 years after surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2006, 40 patients with a symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tear (supraspinatus tendon tear with or without a tear of the infraspinatus tendon) underwent arthroscopic RCR with either an SR repair with a modified Mason-Allen suture-grasping technique (n = 20) or a DR repair with a suture bridge fixation technique (n = 20). All patients were enrolled in a long-term clinical evaluation, with the Constant score (CS) as the primary outcome measure. Furthermore, an ultrasound examination was performed to assess tendon integrity and conventional radiographs to evaluate secondary glenohumeral osteoarthritis. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients, of whom 16 were treated with an SR repair and 11 with a DR repair, were followed up after a mean +/- SD period of 12 +/- 1 years (range, 11-14 years). Five patients underwent revision surgery on the affected shoulder during follow-up period, which led to 22 patients being included. The overall CS remained stable at final follow-up when compared with short-term follow-up (81 +/- 8 vs 83 +/- 19 points; P = .600). An increasing number of full-thickness retears were found: 6 of 22 (27%) at 2 years and 9 of 20 (45%) at 12 years after surgery. While repair failure negatively affected clinical results as shown by the CS (P < .05), no significant difference was found between the fixation techniques (P = .456). In general, progressive osteoarthritic changes were observed, with tendon integrity as a key determinant. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic RCR with either an SR or a DR fixation technique provided good clinical long-term results. Repair failure was high, with negative effects on clinical results and the progression of secondary glenohumeral osteoarthritis. While DR repair slightly enhanced tendon integrity at long-term follow-up, no clinical superiority to SR repair was found.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the widespread use of arthroscopic double-row transosseous-equivalent (TOE) rotator cuff repair (RCR) techniques, midterm outcome data are limited. The purpose of this article was to assess midterm clinical outcomes of patients following arthroscopic TOE RCR using either a knotless tape bridge (TB) repair or knotted suture bridge (SB) repair technique. We hypothesized that there would be significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes with TOE RCR that would be durable over time. We also hypothesized that the knotless TB technique would yield equivalent clinical results to the knotted SB technique, but that there would be differences in retear types between the two TOE techniques. METHODS: Patients included were a minimum of 5 years from an index arthroscopic double-row TOE repair using either a knotless TB or knotted SB technique for one, two, or three tendon full-thickness rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus tendon. Preoperative and postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Short-Form 12 Physical Component Summary, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and satisfaction scores were collected. Scores were also stratified and compared based on primary and revision repair, tear location, and tear chronicity. Outcomes between techniques were contrasted, and survivorship analysis was conducted, with failure defined as progression to revision surgery. RESULTS: One-hundred ninety-two shoulders were included with a mean follow-up of 6.6 years (range, 5.0 to 11.0 years). Fifteen shoulders (7.8%) underwent revision cuff repair. All scores improved significantly for TB repair (P < 0.001). For SB repair, all scores improved, but only American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and Short-Form 12 Physical Component Summary scores (P < 0.05) demonstrated statistical significance. No statistically significant differences were found between the repair techniques when stratified by primary and revision repairs, tear location, or chronicity. Postoperative clinical survivorship was 96.6% and 93.6% for knotted SB repairs and 96.7% and 93.9% for knotless TB repairs at 2 and 5 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: TOE RCR results in significant clinical improvement and excellent survivorship at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up, using either knotted SB or knotless TB repair techniques in primary and revision cases and in small and large tears. Equivalent results were obtained with both TOE techniques. Patients undergoing repair with a TOE showed significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes that were durable at a minimum of 5 years postoperatively.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: : The purpose of this study was to clinically evaluate patients who underwent Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair (RC) using the Modified Manson-Allen technique. METHODS: : We evaluated 79 patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy. The lesions were repaired using the modified Mason-Allen suture between 2003 and 2009, divided by Cofield classification and clinically evaluated by the scoring system of the University of Los Angeles (UCLA) in the pre- and postoperative periods. RESULTS: : The evaluation of lesion sizes showed 7 small lesions (<1cm), 55 average lesions (1-3cm) and 17 large lesions (3-5cm), and in this last group there were 5 reruptures and the patients were reoperated by the same technique. Comparing the pre (14.1) and postoperative (32.6) values by UCLA system there was a significant improvement of score (142.3%), regardless of lesion size. The modified Mason-Allen suture provided satisfactory clinical results, regardless of lesion size, similar to those found in literature. The rerupture rate was high in large lesions. New suture techniques have been developed with the aim of reducing the incidence of rerupture. CONCLUSION: : The modified Mason-Allen suture technique provided clinical improvement, regardless of lesion size. Level of Evidence IV, Cases Series .

AB  - BACKGROUND: The persistent incidence of retear despite improvements in techniques led orthopedic surgeons to the application of principles of tissue bioengineering to achieve enhanced repair and functional outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare clinical and radiologic outcomes of arthroscopic single-row repair augmented with microfracture (SRM) at the greater tuberosity with single-row (SR) and double-row (DR) repair in the treatment of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective comparative study. A total of 123 patients were enrolled for arthroscopic repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, with 40 patients treated by SR, 44 by SRM, and 39 by DR. The minimum follow-up was 2 years. The primary outcome was retear rate, which was detected by magnetic resonance imaging, and the secondary outcome was functional outcome. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 59.2 years, 58.1 years, and 60.6 years in the SR, SRM, and DR groups, respectively. The retear rate was 33%, 14%, and 36% in the SR, SRM, and DR groups, respectively (P = .045). The SRM group had significantly improved functional outcomes compared with the SR and DR groups in terms of the postoperative Constant score and visual analog scale score (P = .001 and .002, respectively). Delta Constant scores were nonsignificant for retear and intact tendons (P = .137). CONCLUSION: SRM has a significantly lower retear rate and better functional outcome than SR and DR repair.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to analyze the correlation of occupancy ratio (OR) and fatty infiltration (FI) to functional outcome and retear rate following rotator cuff repair by single-row technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospectively, all the patients (n = 100) with rotator cuff tear were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with functional scores (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form [ASES], University of California-Los Angeles [UCLA] shoulder score, Constant score) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for OR and FI. Two observers studied the MRI data separately. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS (version 16), paired t test, Pearson correlation, and intraclass correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The mean (+/- standard deviation) follow-up was 16.24 +/- 6.39 months, and the mean age was 56.18 +/- 7.5 years. There was a significant increase in muscle atrophy (decreased OR) and FI (P < .01). The mean preoperative and postoperative ORs were 0.57 and 0.51, respectively. However, the mean functional scores improved significantly for ASES (55.78 to 82.09), UCLA (19.44 to 28.47), and Constant score (49.73 to 75.07) (P < .001). There was no significant difference in functional outcome among the different stages of FI (ASES P = .341, UCLA P = .839, Constant P = .376). Seven patients had asymptomatic retear during follow-up, of which 2 patients had grade 3, 4 patients had grade 2, and 1 patient had grade 1 FI, preoperatively. CONCLUSION: Muscle atrophy and FI are irreversible phenomena and continue even after successful repair; however, they do not have a significant influence on the functional outcome at short-term follow-up after cuff repair. Repairing cuff with higher grades of FI can be performed as they achieve significantly improved functional outcomes.

AB  - Rotator cuff tendon tears are a common source of shoulder pain and combine both traumatic and degenerative elements. The incidence of this condition is increasing along with an aging population. The management of rotator cuff tears is complex and multifactorial. Partial-thickness tears may heal with conservative management and avoidance of predisposing factors. Operative treatment allows primary repair to be performed as either an open or an arthroscopic procedure. Despite satisfactory results for primary rotator cuff repair, the incidence of persistent tendon defects or retears is still significant. © Springer-Verlag London 2014. All rights Reserverd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic techniques are now considered the gold standard for treatment of most rotator cuff (RC) tears; however, no consensus exists on the maintenance of results over time, and long-term follow-up data have been reported for few cohorts of patients. PURPOSE: To present the long-term results associated with the arthroscopic treatment of RC tears and to evaluate associations between preoperative factors and RC integrity at final follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 169 patients were contacted at least 10 years after arthroscopic RC surgery and were invited to a clinical evaluation. Information on preoperative conditions, tear size, subjective satisfaction, and functional scores was collected; isometric strength and range of motion were also measured; and each patient underwent an ultrasound examination to evaluate supraspinatus integrity and a shoulder radiograph to evaluate osteoarthritis. RESULTS: A total of 149 patients (88.2% of the eligible patients) were available for a complete telephonic interview, and 102 patients were available for the final evaluation. Ultrasound revealed an intact supraspinatus in 54 patients (53.47%). By adding the 10 patients who underwent revision surgery to the nonintact group, this percentage would drop to 48.65%. Tear size was associated with supraspinatus integrity in univariate analysis (hazard ratio, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.63-5.69; P = .001) and multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.03-4.62; P = .04). However, no significant differences were encountered in the subjective and functional scores collected, with the exception of the Constant-Murley Score, which was significantly higher in patients with smaller tears at the index procedure. Strength testing also revealed significantly superior abduction and flexion strength in this group, and radiographs showed a significantly higher acromion-humeral distance and lower grades of osteoarthritis. Patients with an intact supraspinatus at final follow-up showed superior results in all functional scores, greater satisfaction, superior abduction and flexion strength, higher acromion-humeral distance, and lower grades of osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: RC tear size at the time of surgery significantly affects supraspinatus integrity at a minimum follow-up of 10 years. However, a larger tear is not associated with an inferior subjective result, although it negatively influences abduction and flexion strength, range of motion, and osteoarthritis progression. Intraoperative efforts to obtain a durable RC repair are encouraged, since supraspinatus integrity at final follow-up influences clinical and functional outcomes, patient satisfaction, and osteoarthritis progression.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to compare, at 10-year follow-up, the clinical and radiological outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with or without the addition of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) over the tendon-bone interface at the end of the surgical procedure. METHODS: Of 53 patients recruited in the study, and randomly divided into 2 groups (PRP = 26; control = 27), 38 were re-evaluated at least 10 years after the index procedure. The clinical evaluation was carried out through: University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Score, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Simple Shoulder Test, Constant-Murley Score (CMS), Single Assessment Numerical Evaluation (SANE), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and isometric strength in abduction, forward flexion and external rotation. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography had been used to evaluate the integrity of the repaired cuff. RESULTS: A number of 38 (71%) patients (PRP = 17; control = 21) with a median age of 71 [64.75-76.50] years have been evaluated. Satisfaction at follow-up is high (90%), without statistically significant difference between the two groups. We report good and excellent clinical results in both groups (PRP vs control): CMS (81.62 [72.47-85.75] vs 77.97 [69.52-82.55] points), UCLA (34 [29.00-35.00] vs 33 [29.00-35.00] points), VAS (0.34 [0.00-1.85] vs 0.70 [0.00-2.45] cm). It was not possible to find a statistically significant difference for the variables analyzed, except for ASES and SANE. On average, 37% of the operated patients had a re-rupture at the ultrasound examination, regardless of the treatment group (P = 1.00). Compared with the previous radiological control at the 2-year follow-up, new retears occurred in 6% of the patients who received PRP treatment, whereas in the control group the percentage raises to 14% (P = .61). CONCLUSION: The clinical and radiological outcomes at the 10-year follow-up show a substantial uniformity of results between the 2 groups. The minor differences that had been observed at 2-year follow-up disappeared at long term. Patients' satisfaction is still high 10 years after surgical treatment. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, randomized controlled trial, treatment study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The reported failure rate of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair varies widely. The influence of repair technique on failure rates and functional outcomes after arthroscopic cuff repair remains controversial. PURPOSE: To determine the functional outcome of arthroscopic knotless fixation using the Opus AutoCuff device for rotator cuff repair and to compare our results with those reported in the literature. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using an Opus AutoCuff device (Arthrocare, Sunnydale, California) with greater than 2 years' follow-up. Subjective and objective clinical examinations were performed to include the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) rating scale, the visual analog scale (VAS), and the Tegner Activity Level scale. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 26 months (range, 24-35 months). The mean UCLA shoulder score was 33.1 of 35 (SD, 2.89) possible points, and the mean ASES rating scale was 94.2 of 100 (SD, 7.76) compared with a mean preoperative score of 65.7 (P < .001). Postoperative UCLA shoulder scores had 42 of 45 (93.3%) patients with good and excellent results. The mean preoperative ASES pain score was 1.3 (SD, 1.0), and the mean postoperative score was 4.4 (SD, 1.0) (P < .001). The Tegner Activity Level scores demonstrated restoration of function to preinjury status. There were 3 failures (6.3%), 2 by anchor failure (1 with specific trauma), and 1 by rotator cuff retear, all requiring revision surgery. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic knotless suture fixation with the Opus AutoCuff device results in good to excellent results similar to those reported in the literature with conventional suture anchors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: When using a method of suture bridge technique, there may be a possibility of strangulation of the rotator cuff tendon at the medial row. The style of knots chosen to secure the medial row might conceivably be a factor to reduce this possibility. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical results and repair integrity of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between a knotless and a conventional knot-tying suture bridge technique for patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears and to evaluate retear patterns in the cases with structural failure after arthroscopic repair by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: After arthroscopic repair for medium-sized rotator cuff tears, 110 patients available for postoperative MRI evaluation at least 6 months were enrolled in this study. According to the repair technique, 51 shoulders were enrolled in a knotless suture bridge technique group (group A) and 59 shoulders in a conventional knot-tying suture bridge technique group (group B). The mean age at the time of the operation was 61.0 years (range, 44-68 years) in group A and 57.6 years (range, 45-70 years) in group B. The mean follow-up period was 21.2 months (range, 12-34 months) and 22.1 months (range, 13-32 months), respectively. RESULTS: The Constant score of group A increased from the preoperative mean of 65.2 points to 79.1 points at the last follow-up (P < .001). The corresponding figures for group B improved from 66.6 points to 76.3 points (P < .001). The preoperative Shoulder Rating Scale of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score was 21.1 points in group A and 18.3 points in group B. The UCLA score at the last follow-up was 31.0 points in group A and 27.9 points in group B (P < .001, P < .001). Retear rate was significantly lower in group A (5.9%) than group B (18.6%) (P < .001). In group B, retear occurred at the musculotendinous junction in 72.7%, but group A had no medial cuff failure. CONCLUSION: In arthroscopic suture bridge repair of full-thickness rotator cuff tears, clinical results of both a knotless and a conventional knot-tying group showed improvement without significant difference between the 2 groups. However, the knotless group had a significantly lower retear rate compared with the conventional knot-tying group. A knotless suture bridge technique could be a new supplementary repair technique to conventional technique.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical and structural outcomes of rotator cuff repairs in patients older than 70 years and those younger than 70 years and to analyze a correlation between patient factors and retear rate. METHODS: Two hundred thirty-eight patients between the ages of 60 and 79 who underwent rotator cuff repair between 2006 and 2011 and were available for postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation at least 6 months after surgery were enrolled in this study. They were divided into 2 groups, one group (n = 191) included patients aged between 60 and 69 years, and the other group (n = 47) included patients aged between 70 and 79 years. The mean follow-up period was 14.6 months (range, 12-63 months) and 13.2 months (range, 12-62 months) for patients in their 60s and 70s, respectively. RESULTS: The mean visual analog scale (VAS), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Constant scores significantly improved from 5.4, 18.1, and 57.4 preoperatively to 1.0, 31.2, and 75.0 at the final follow-up, respectively (P < .001), in the 60s group and from 5.9, 17.0, and 53.6 to 1.3, 30.1, and 72.7, respectively (P < .001), in the 70s group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups (P > .05). Instead, intraoperative tear size was correlated with the clinical scores with Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.161 and -0.211 for patients in their 60s and 70s, respectively. There were 76 (39.8%) retears among patients in their 60s and 24 (51.1%) retears among patients in their 70s, with no significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .161). The retear rate increased significantly with increasing preoperative tear size (P < .001; odds ratio [OR], 7.1 in large tears; P < .0001; OR, 17.2 in massive tears). Age and sex were not significantly correlated with the retear rate. CONCLUSIONS: Both patients in their 60s and 70s showed significant improvement in clinical outcomes after rotator cuff repair, without a significant difference between the 2 populations. The retear rate increased significantly with increasing intraoperative tear size but not with increasing age. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated clinical outcomes for isolated subscapularis tendon tears treated by arthroscopic repair, the factors affecting clinical outcomes, and changes in tendon structural integrity using magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: Between 2005 and 2013, 45 patients with isolated subscapularis tendon tears were enrolled from two institutions. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the pain visual analog scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and Simple Shoulder Test scores. We evaluated factors affecting clinical outcomes: trauma history, tear classification, sex, age, symptom duration, preoperative fatty infiltration grade, cross-sectional area (CSA), cranial-transversal diameter, and caudal-transversal diameter. Subscapularis tendon integrity and fatty infiltration grade were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: No complications occurred except for tendon rerupture in 1 patient. No significant changes in tendon structural integrity occurred except for those related to CSA. Tendon structural integrity was significantly different between tears less than one-fourth of the entire subscapularis tendon and those exceeding one-fourth. However, there were no statistically significant differences in clinical outcomes between the 2 types of tear. Age was significantly associated with clinical outcomes, including Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and Simple Shoulder Test scores. Men experienced better outcomes than women in Constant and Simple Shoulder Test scores. As the postoperative period progressed, the difference in CSA, cranial-transversal diameter, and caudal-transversal diameter decreased to the point of no statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair of isolated subscapularis tear provided significant functional improvements with a low rerupture rate. Age was significantly associated with clinical results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the retear rate, retear size and location, the clinical impact of a retear, and preoperative patient factors related to postoperative outcome after arthroscopic suture bridge rotator cuff repair. METHODS: Fifty six patients with an isolated, full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear who underwent arthroscopic suture bridge rotator cuff repair were retrospectively identified. Patients were evaluated and rotator cuff integrity was assessed using ultrasonography. Visual analog score (VAS), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) score, shoulder range of motion and strength were used for clinical evaluation. Retears were assessed for size and location on ultrasonography. RESULTS: Forty two patients (75%) aged a mean 59.7 +/- 8.6 years (range 41-79 years) were available for follow-up at a mean 13.5 months. Postoperative evaluation indicated significant improvements in ASES score (49.76 +/- 18.2 to 86.57 +/- 13.4, P < 0.001), VAS pain score (4.69 +/- 2.17 to 0.63 +/- 1.29, P < 0.001), forward elevation range of motion (144.1degree +/- 29.9 to 159.69degree +/- 13.9, P = 0.002), and internal rotation ROM (44.13degree +/- 12.0 to 52.09degree +/- 12.0, P = 0.003). The retear rate was 14.28% (6/42). Patients with retears were not older (P = 0.526) but had a larger preoperative tear size (3.25 cm +/- 0.5 vs. 2.05 cm +/- 0.48, P < 0.001). Preoperative tear size was significantly associated with a postoperative retear (P < 0.001). The duration of preoperative symptoms was significantly associated with pain (P = 0.029), pain improvement (P = 0.013), internal rotation ROM (P = 0.002), and internal rotation strength (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic suture bridge repair provides good clinical results with a low retear rate. The duration of preoperative symptoms was associated with postoperative outcome, indicating that delaying surgery may result in inferior outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, Case Series.

AB  - Background: After rotator cuff repair, some patients have ongoing problems significant enough to warrant presentation to a clinic for reassessment. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine whether this cohort of patients was more likely to have a healed rotator cuff. We hypothesized that patients who had an unscheduled postoperative visit were more likely to have a healed rotator cuff than those who did not have an unscheduled postoperative visit. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 321 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were evaluated; of these, 50 patients had an unscheduled return to clinic that included an ultrasound assessment of the cuff repair within 4 months postoperatively. Repair integrity was evaluated in all patients at 6 months postoperatively via ultrasonography. Results: The failure-to-heal rate was greater in patients who had an unscheduled assessment (8/50; 16%) than in those who did not (14/275; 5%) (P = .01). The patients most likely to have a repair failure were those who were assessed before 2 weeks and after 12 weeks (7/18; 39%) compared with those who were assessed between 3 and 12 weeks (1/32; 3%) (P = .001). The failure-to-heal rate was very low in patients who had an unscheduled assessment with a tear size smaller than 4 cm<sup>2</sup> (0/34; 0%) compared with those with tear sizes greater than 4 cm<sup>2</sup> (8/16; 50%) (P < .0001, Fisher exact text). Conclusion: Patients who had an unscheduled clinic visit after rotator cuff repair had a 16% chance of a failed healing response, whereas those who did not have an unscheduled visit had a 5% rate of failed healing. The risk of a failed healing response was greater if the tear was larger than 4 cm<sup>2</sup>, if patients presented within 2 weeks following surgery, or if they presented after 12 weeks postsurgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify the difference in postoperative perianchor bone reactions in different groups of patients who underwent rotator cuff tear repairs with all-suture-, bioabsorbable screw-, and PEEK (polyether ether ketone)-type suture anchors. Furthermore, the rate of rotator cuff retear and its association with perianchor bone reactions based on the different anchors used were investigated. Moreover, their impact on the clinical outcome of patients was examined. METHODS: The study included 213 patients who underwent arthroscopic single-row repair and were divided into 3 groups according to the suture anchor used: all-suture (n = 137), biodegradable (n = 36), and PEEK (n = 40) anchor groups. The clinical outcomes and magnetic resonance imaging findings were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 9.6 months. The perianchor bone reaction at the anchor site was categorized according to grades. Patients were classified based on repair integrity into the healed and retear groups with Sugaya type I to III and Sugaya type IV to V, respectively. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in Constant scores and retear rates were observed between the groups (P = .934 and P = .548, respectively). Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the total number of perianchor cysts formed postoperatively was 23 (10.8% [23 of 213 patients]). Moreover, the proportions of perianchor cysts were 8.8%, 16.7%, and 12.5% in the all-suture-type, bioabsorbable-, and PEEK-type anchor groups, respectively (P = .485). In the retear group, the incidence rate was significantly increased with higher grades of perianchor bone reaction (P = .001). The tear size and perianchor bone reaction were found to be independent factors that affected the incidence of retear. CONCLUSIONS: Perianchor cyst formation was observed in 10.8% of cases after the use of suture anchors for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. No significant differences were observed among all-suture-type, bioabsorbable-type, and PEEK-type anchors in terms of visual analog scale and Constant scores, retear rates, and perianchor bone reactions. However, the retear rate was associated with a greater perianchor cystic reaction and larger tear size. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative trial.

AB  - To identify risk factors for complications after rotator cuff repair, all repairs (open and arthroscopic, single row and double row, primary and revision) performed by a single surgeon over a 4-year period were reviewed. Complications were classified as minor or major. Minor complications included serous drainage, local erythema resolving with observation or oral antibiotics, and associated shoulder girdle tendinitis. Major complications included wound or deltoid dehiscence, recurrent rotator cuff tear with clinical decompensation, and deep infection requiring surgical treatment. Ninety-two patients (96 repairs, 31 open and 65 arthroscopic, 87 primary and 9 revision) met inclusion criteria. The overall complication rate at 12 weeks was 10.5% (3 minor and 7 major complications). The complication rate with open repair (26%) was significantly higher than with all-arthroscopic repair (3%). Large/massive tears had a 21% complication rate compared with 5% in small/medium tears. There was no statistically significant difference in complication rates between single-row (9%) and double-row (25%) repairs or between revisions (22%) and primary repairs (9%). Open repair, large/massive tear size, tobacco use, and preoperative narcotic use were statistically significant predictors of complications in the early (< 12 wk) postoperative period after rotator cuff repair.

AB  - This study reports the clinical and sonographic outcome of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in patients aged >= 70 years and aimed to determine factors associated with re-tear. A total of 69 consecutive repairs were performed in 68 patients with a mean age of 77 years (70 to 86). Constant-Murley scores were collected pre-operatively and at one year post-operatively. The integrity of the repair was assessed using ultrasound. Re-tear was detected in 20 of 62 patients (32%) assessed with ultrasound. Age at operation was significantly associated with re-tear free survival (p = 0.016). The mean pre-operative Constant score was 23 (sd 14), which increased to 58 (sd 20) at one year post-operatively (paired t-test, p < 0.001). Male gender was significantly associated with a higher score at one year (p = 0.019). We conclude that arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in patients aged >= 70 years is a successful procedure. The gender and age of the patient are important factors to consider when planning management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tears are often surgically repaired, generally with good results. However, repairs not infrequently retear, and how important repair integrity is with respect to early functional outcomes after rotator cuff repair is unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a retear on overhead activities in a large cohort of patients after rotator cuff repair. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data from 1600 consecutive rotator cuff repairs. Outcomes were based on patient responses to the L'Insalata Shoulder Questionnaire and findings on examination preoperatively and at 6 months of follow-up. Repair integrity was determined by ultrasound imaging at the 6-month follow-up visit. RESULTS: The 1600 patients (885 men, 715 women) were a mean age of 58 years. Postoperative ultrasound imaging found 13% (211 of 1600) of repairs had retorn. Significant improvements were seen irrespective of rotator cuff integrity in pain levels with overhead activity (P < .0001) and range of motion in forward flexion (P < .001) and abduction (P < .01). Patients with intact repairs had 9.5 N greater supraspinatus strength (P < .0001) and 6.9 N greater external rotation strength (P < .01) than those with a retear. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the largest study to evaluate the effect of rotator cuff repair integrity on shoulder function. Patients who had an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair reported significant improvements in overhead pain levels irrespective of the repair integrity at 6 months. Repair integrity influenced supraspinatus and external rotation power, where patients with intact repairs were stronger than those with a retear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has traditionally been performed in the subacromial space from the bursal side of the tendon. The undersurface rotator cuff repair technique involves the arthroscope remaining in the glenohumeral joint, thus viewing the tendon from its undersurface during repair without a bursectomy or acromioplasty. PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and structural outcomes of undersurface rotator cuff repair with bursal-side repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted on 2 cohorts of patients who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with knotless suture anchors configured in a single-row formation using inverted mattress-style sutures from either the bursal side (n = 100) or undersurface (n = 165) of the supraspinatus tendon. Data were collected preoperatively, intraoperatively, and at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 2 years postoperatively. At each time point, patients completed a modified L'Insalata questionnaire to assess patient-ranked pain scores and were clinically examined using standardized tests. Ultrasound examination was performed at 6 months and 2 years to assess the integrity of the repair. RESULTS: At 2 years postoperatively, patients in both cohorts had significantly less pain and less difficulty with overhead activities compared with preoperative levels (P < .001). The type of repair performed (bursal or undersurface) did not affect the ability to perform overhead activities at 2 years. At 2 years, both groups also had similar retear rates (21% for bursal side, 23% for undersurface). The mean operative time for the arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was 32 minutes when performed from the bursal side and 20 minutes when performed from the undersurface (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, whether performed from the subacromial space or glenohumeral joint, resulted in decreased levels of pain and difficulty with overhead activities at 2 years. The major difference between the 2 techniques was operative time, with the undersurface technique being performed significantly faster than the bursal-side repair technique.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review outcomes of arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears using absorbable anchors with a single-row technique. METHODS: 66 patients underwent arthroscopic repair for rotator cuff tears using absorbable anchors with a single-row technique. 51 of them aged 37 to 73 (mean, 57) years had been followed up for a mean of 29 (range, 20-37) months. The extent of the tear was classified as large, medium or small. Functional outcome was assessed using the Constant score. Constant scores and re-tear rates in 3 patient groups (classified by patient age and tear size) were compared. RESULTS: Among the 66 patients, there were 24 large, 29 medium and 13 small cuff tears, and a total of 48, 37, and 18 anchors were used, respectively. Among the 51 patients, the median Constant score improved significantly after arthroscopy (30 vs. 73, p<0.0001). Six shoulders had complete re-tears; their median Constant score was 48 and their adjusted Constant score was 65%. Complete re-tears occurred more often in patients aged >60 years than in those aged 50 to 59 years and <50 years (4/15 vs. 1/22 vs. 1/14), and more often in patients with large tears than in those with medium and small tears (4/24 vs. 2/29 vs. 0/13). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair of rotator cuff tears using absorbable anchors with a single-row technique is reliable in patients aged <60 years with small or medium tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the essential role of vitamin D in muscle function, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be very high. Recently, low vitamin D level was found to correlate with fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff tendon in humans and to negatively affect early healing at the rotator cuff repair site in an animal study. However, the effects of vitamin D level on severity of rotator cuff tear and healing after surgical repair have not been documented. PURPOSE: To evaluate (1) the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among patients who underwent arthroscopic repair for a full-thickness rotator cuff tear, (2) the relationship of vitamin D level with severity of the rotator cuff tear, and (3) surgical outcomes after repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A consecutive series of 91 patients (age, 50-65 years) who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair for full-thickness, small-sized to massive tears were evaluated. Preoperative serum vitamin D levels (25-hydroxyvitamin) were analyzed to detect correlations with the features of a preoperative rotator cuff tear as well as postoperative structural and functional outcomes. All patients were followed clinically for a minimum of 1 year. RESULTS: Preoperative vitamin D levels were deficient (<20 ng/mL) in 80 subjects (88%), insufficient (20-30 ng/mL) in 8 subjects (9%), and normal (>30 ng/mL) in 3 subjects (3%). No correlation was found between preoperative tear size (P = .23), extent of retraction (P = .60), degree of fatty infiltration of each cuff muscle (P > .50 each), or the global fatty infiltration index (P = .32). Similarly, no correlations were detected between vitamin D level and postoperative Sugaya type (P = .66) or any of the functional outcome scores (P > .50 each). CONCLUSION: Low serum vitamin D level was not related to tear size, extent of retraction, or the degree of fatty infiltration in cuff muscles. It also had no significant relationships with postoperative structural integrity and functional outcomes after arthroscopic repair. The results suggest that low serum vitamin D level is not a significant risk factor for the severity of rotator cuff tear or poor healing after repair.

AB  - Background: Although rotator cuff syndrome is common and extensively studied from the perspective of producing healed tendons, influence of gender on patient-reported outcomes is less well examined. As activity and role demands may vary widely between men and women, clarity on whether gender is an important factor in outcome would enhance patient education and expectation management. Our purpose was to determine if differences exist in patient-reported outcomes between men and women undergoing rotator cuff surgery. Method(s): One hundred forty-eight participants (76 W:72 M) aged 35-75 undergoing surgery for unilateral symptomatic rotator cuff syndrome were followed for 12 months after surgery. Demographics, surgical data, and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) scores were collected. Surgery was performed by two fellowship-trained shoulder surgeons at a single site. Result(s): There were no gender-based differences in overall WORC score or subcategory scores by 12 months post-op. Pain scores were similar at all time points in men and women. Women were more likely to have dominant-arm surgery and had smaller rotator cuff tears than men. Complication rates were low, and satisfaction was high in both groups. Conclusion(s): Patient gender doesn't appear to exert an important effect on patient-reported rotator cuff outcomes in this prospective cohort. Further work examining other covariates as well as the qualitative experience of going through rotator cuff repair should provide greater insight into factors that influence patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff tears are the most frequent tendon injury in the adult population. However, the natural history of nonoperatively treated full-thickness tears is poorly defined. Knowledge of the expected evolution in tear size is important when considering nonoperative versus surgical care, especially in relatively young, active patients. PURPOSE: To evaluate the size change of nonoperatively treated full-thickness rotator cuff tears over 2 to 3 years' follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: The authors prospectively followed patients 60 years old or younger who had a full-thickness rotator cuff tear equal to or larger than 5 mm, as diagnosed by bilateral shoulder ultrasound, and who were treated nonoperatively. At 2 to 3 years after the index ultrasound examination, a repeat ultrasound examination was performed by the same ultrasonographer. Results of the follow-up ultrasound examinations of both shoulders were compared with those of the index ultrasound examinations for change in rotator cuff tear size. The correlations were examined between these changes and age, sex, history of initial trauma, size of tear on the index ultrasound, and current shoulder symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with 61 rotator cuff tears were evaluated. At a follow-up of 25 to 39 months (mean, 29), 49% of the tears (30 tears) increased in size, 43% (26 tears) had not changed, and 8% (5 tears) decreased in size. For 25% (10 shoulders ) of initially intact shoulders (41 shoulders), a new full-thickness rotator cuff tear was diagnosed. No correlation was found between the change in tear size and age of the patient (P = .85), sex (P = .93), existence of a prior trauma (P = .63), size of tear at index ultrasound (P = .62), and bilateral tears (P = 1.00). There was a correlation between the existence of considerable pain at the time of the follow-up ultrasound and a clinically significant increase in tear size (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Full-thickness rotator cuff tears tend to increase in size in about half of patients aged 60 years or younger. Surgery should be initially considered in these patients to prevent a probable increase in size tear. Patients treated nonoperatively should be routinely monitored for tear size increase, especially if they remain symptomatic.

AB  - Background: Knot-tying suture-bridge (SB) rotator cuff repair may compromise the vascularity of the repaired tendon, causing tendon strangulation and medial repair failure. The knotless SB repair technique has been proposed to overcome this possibility and decrease retear rates. Purpose: To compare clinical and structural outcomes and retear patterns between the knot-tying and knotless SB techniques. We hypothesized that the knotless technique would result in lower retear rates owing to the preservation of intratendinous vascularity. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 104 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears were randomly and prospectively allocated to undergo knot-tying (group 1) or knotless (group 2) SB repair. Clinical outcome measures included range of motion, the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the Constant score for function. Repair integrity was evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging scans using the Sugaya classification. Retears were also classified according to their pattern as type 1 (lateral) or type 2 (medial). Results: Overall, 88 patients (group 1: n = 42 [mean +/- SD age, 54.3 +/- 9.8 years]; group 2: n = 46 [mean +/- SD age, 55.8 +/- 8.2 years]) were included in the final analysis. The mean +/- SD follow-up period was 25.4 +/- 8.3 and 23.3 +/- 7.2 months for groups 1 and 2, respectively. From preoperatively to postoperatively, the mean VAS pain score improved significantly in both groups (group 1: from 7.4 +/- 1.7 to 1.0 +/- 1.7; group 2: from 7.1 +/- 1.9 to 1.3 +/- 2.0; P < .0001 for both), as did the mean +/- SD Constant score (group 1: from 51.7 +/- 13.4 to 86.0 +/- 11.5; group 2: from 49.4 +/- 18.4 to 87.2 +/- 14.8; P < .0001 for both). There was no significant difference between the groups for the postoperative VAS or Constant score. The retear rate was not significantly different between the groups (19.0% [8/42] in group 1 and 28.3% [13/46] in group 2; P > .05). There was a significant difference in the type 2 failure rate (75.0% [6/8] in group 1 and 23.1% [3/13] in group 2; P = .03). Conclusion: Both techniques showed excellent improvement and comparable clinical outcomes, and there was no significant difference in retear rates. Consistent with previously published data, the type 2 failure rate was significantly higher with the knot-tying technique. Registration: NCT03982108 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier).

AB  - [Purpose] We followed-up patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) for 2 years to assess the prognosis of rotator cuff tears and compared the outcomes of the patients with and without re-rupture. We also examined the usefulness of Shoulder36, a self-assessment tool, for assessing the long-term prognosis in patients undergoing ARCR. [Participants and Methods] We included 28 patients who received occupational therapy pre- and post-ARCR between April 2012 and August 2015 and categorized them based on the occurrence of re-rupture. We followed-up on their prognoses for 2 years using physical examination and Shoulder36 assessment. [Results] Re-rupture occurred in five patients within 3 months of treatment. During the 2 year follow-up, the control group showed a significant improvement in pain and bi-directional active range of motion during physical assessment and in five out of six domains during Shoulder36 assessment. In contrast, the re-rupture group showed significant differences for only three domains of the Shoulder36 assessment twelve months after surgery. [Conclusion] We confirmed the long-term functional improvement and maintenance in the re-rupture group, suggesting that continued rehabilitation, compensatory movements, and detailed guidance on daily life activities are required for patients after ARCR. Furthermore, Shoulder36 can be useful for assessing the prognosis of patients with and without re-rupture.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Functional outcome after rotator cuff reconstruction is influenced by several factors of which re-rupture is probably the most important. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the postoperative outcome including re-rupture rate after arthroscopic rotator cuff reconstruction. METHOD: 23 shoulders of 22 patients were examined prospectively. Physical examination, ultrasound and radiography were performed. Quality of life and functional outcome were evaluated using Constant Score and Visual Analog Scale. RESULTS: Excellent or good results were found in 80% of the patients. The Constant Score has increased from 45 to 79, and the level of pain decreased from 6.6 to 2.5. Full-thickness rotator cuff tear was absent, but partial tear occurred in 7 cases (30%). Average acromiohumeral distance in the operated side was 8.5 mm compared to 9.5 mm measured on the contralateral shoulder. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is a safe and reliable procedure that provides good results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This article reviews the clinical and radiographic outcomes in a noninferiority trial use of a transosseous knotless anchor to perform arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs in a patient cohort that have an increased incidence of osteoporosis. METHODS: Patients aged over 60 with a documented rotator cuff tear and who failed a rehab program underwent repair using an arthroscopic transosseous knotless (ATOK) anchor. Patients were prospectively reviewed using shoulder functional assessments (age-adjusted Constant score, Oxford Shoulder Score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form [ASES], visual analog scale [VAS] pain scores), and underwent preoperative as well as 1-, 3-, and 12-month postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: 15 patients had undergone rotator cuff repair using the ATOK and were followed for a minimum of 24 months (range 24-30 months). From preoperative to 24 months post repair, median scores improved for ASES (61-89), Oxford (26-44), Constant (62-91), and VAS Pain (5-0.5). Four patients developed a partial retear of their repair, but only 1 patient sustained a complete retear: Sugaya type I, 10; type II, 1; type III, 2; type IV, 1; and type V, 1. No anchors were displaced, and there were no osteolysis, neurologic, or technique-related complications. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs using a transosseous knotless technique has achieved a satisfactory outcome in this group of patients, who typically have poor bone quality, increasing the risk of antegrade anchor pullout. This approach would appear to combine the potential biomechanical and biological advantages of a transosseous repair technique, with the benefits of the lower morbidity arthroscopic surgical approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although good short-term and midterm outcomes are reported for mini-open rotator cuff repair, few prospective studies have investigated long-term results. HYPOTHESIS: Function and health-related quality of life (HRQL) outcomes would be maintained 10 years after mini-open rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Patients with a confirmed full-thickness rotator cuff tear who underwent mini-open repair between April 1997 and July 2000 were evaluated preoperatively as well as 1 year and 10 years postoperatively for (1) pain, function, and HRQL using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) score; (2) active shoulder range of motion (ROM) using goniometry; and (3) satisfaction by an independent evaluator. Changes in function, HRQL, and ROM over time were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 84 patients were enrolled, of which 61 (73%) were men; the mean (+/-SD) age was 53.0 +/- 9.9 years. At 10 years, 4 (5%) patients were deceased, and 4 (5%) had symptomatic retears. Fifty-nine (74%) patients were evaluated, composed of 43 (73%) men; 26 (44%) were younger than 60 years. Function and HRQL significantly improved over the course of follow-up (P < .001), primarily within the first postoperative year. At 10 years, the mean ASES score was 90.4 +/- 19.4, similar to the 1-year score of 91.1 +/- 12.0 (P = .83). The mean WORC score at 10 years was 88.7 +/- 17.8, with no change from the 1-year score of 88.4 +/- 13.6 (P = .93). This relationship did not change after adjusting for age and tear size. Shoulder ROM was also maintained over 10 years. Flexion ROM improved in the first postoperative year, and this improvement was sustained at 10 years after surgery (P >= .30). External rotation ROM was slower to improve postoperatively, and significant improvements were seen between 1 and 10 years (P < .01). Fifty-three patients (90%) were satisfied or very satisfied with their results. Tear size, workers' compensation board claimant status, sex, and smoking status did not influence HRQL or shoulder ROM (P > .06). CONCLUSION: Postoperative improvements in function and HRQL after mini-open rotator cuff repair were retained at 10 years.

AB  - Purpose: To use a population-level dataset to evaluate the rate of 30-day complications after rotator cuff repair, and to evaluate the risk factors for complication and unplanned hospital readmission. Method(s): We used the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2011 to 2015 to identify patients who underwent rotator cuff repair and concomitant procedures using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Postoperative complications and unplanned hospital readmissions were identified. Patient demographics, medical comorbidities, and perioperative variables were used in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify the risk factors for infection, any complication, and unplanned hospital readmission. Result(s): A total of 23,741 patients were identified who underwent rotator cuff repair. Overall, 1.39% of patients experienced at least 1 complication, with 0.66% minor complications and 0.85% major complications. Unplanned readmission occurred in 1.16% of patients. Infection was the most common complication, occurring in 0.3% of patients (n = 72), and was the most common reason for return to the operating room. Open rotator cuff repair and male gender were independent risk factors for all outcomes. Increased age and numerous medical comorbidities were associated with the risk of any complication or unplanned hospital readmission. Conclusion(s): Rotator cuff repair has a low incidence of short-term complications. Infection was the most common complication. Open repair, male gender, increased age, and medical comorbidities all significantly increased the risk of complications and hospital readmission. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of critical shoulder angle (CSA), acromion index (AI), and glenoid inclination (GI) on the postoperative healing rate after arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair. METHODS: Patients after arthroscopic repair of a symptomatic, unilateral, single-tendon, full-thickness supraspinatus tear in whom nonoperative management had failed were retrospectively reviewed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies were obtained 6 months postoperatively and were evaluated by 2 independent observers. Repair integrity was classified as either intact or torn. Preoperative true anteroposterior radiographs were used to measure CSA, AI, and GI. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were evaluated 6 months postoperatively. The mean patient age at surgery was 54.7 +/- 7.7 years. On MRI studies, 41 patients (71.9%) had an intact repair and 16 patients (28.1%) had a full-thickness retear. There were no significant differences between the intact and retear group in regard to patient age (P = .648), initial tear size (P = .205), or fatty degeneration (P = .508). The mean CSA for the retear group (37degree +/- 4degree) was significantly higher than that in the intact group (35degree +/- 3degree; P = .014). If the CSA was >38degree, the odds ratio of having a retear was 3.78 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 13.58; P = .042). Average AI for the retear group (0.73 +/- 0.09) was significantly higher than that in the intact group (0.69 +/- 0.06; P = .049). The mean GI was 17degree +/- 6degree for the intact group and 16degree +/- 6degree for the retear group (P = .739). CONCLUSIONS: At short-term follow-up, higher CSA and AI significantly increased the retear risk after arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair. CSA >38degree increased the retear risk almost 4-fold. Overall GI was elevated but did not correlate with failure rate. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, case control study.

AB  - This study evaluated pre- and postoperative clinical and structural outcome data on anterosuperior rotator cuff tears involving the supraspinatus and subscapularis treated by arthroscopic methods. Between June 2006 and October 2007, a total of 155 consecutive patients underwent an arthroscopic repair for a supraspinatus or supraspinatus and infraspinatus (superior) rotator cuff tear. Of these, 44 (28%) were identified on preoperative imaging to have involvement of the subscapularis. Confirmation of subscapularis tears occurred during arthroscopic repair of the superior rotator cuff. If the subscapularis was found to be torn, it was documented, and an arthroscopic repair was performed. Postoperative clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed with the belly press and lift-off tests, range of motion, strength, pain score, Constant score, and either a magnetic resonance imaging arthrogram or a computed tomography arthrogram at an average of 15 months postoperatively. Failure was determined based on rotator cuff integrity on radiologic studies. Sixteen of the 44 anterosuperior rotator cuff tears identified on preoperative imaging were found to have a full-thickness subscapularis tear requiring repair on arthroscopic examination. On preoperative imaging, subscapularis tears were all either grade 1 or grade 2 (no complete grade 3 tears). Mean follow-up was 16.9 months (range, 13-24 months). Compared with preoperative values, significant postoperative improvements occurred in Constant scores, forward flexion, strength, and pain scores (P<.01). Patients also showed significant improvements in both the lift-off and belly press tests (P<.001). Mean postoperative patient satisfaction was 7.9 (range, 5-10) with 10 (59%) of 17 patients being extremely satisfied. Two of the 17 patients with an anterosuperior rotator cuff tear had confirmed retears of the supraspinatus (1 partial and 1 full-thickness) with no radiographic evidence of retear of any of the subscapularis repairs at most recent follow-up.

AB  - Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of clinically significant postoperative stiffness after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and its resolution. The study also sought to determine clinical and surgical factors that may be associated with increased rates of postoperative stiffness. Methods: We conducted a level III retrospective review of a consecutive series of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. During a 5-year period, the senior author (C.J.R.) performed 150 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs at our institution. Demographic data, comorbid medical conditions, descriptions of rotator cuff tears (including size and level of retraction), and concomitant surgical procedures were evaluated on their correlation with stiffness. All office visits were reviewed to determine preoperative and postoperative motion. Patients were followed up at 1 week, 3 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 3 months, about 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Results: In our analysis of tear types, we were unable to associate stiffness with the type of tear, the tendon torn, or the number of tendons torn or with whether the tendons were retracted. However, we were able to associate female sex, workers' compensation insurance, and a concomitant biceps procedure with stiffness at several time points. The incidence of stiffness was highest at 12 weeks, with 7.3% of patients presenting with stiffness. The rate of stiffness decreased with continued follow-up. Stiffness was found in 3.3% of patients at 16-24 weeks and in 1.6% of patients at 1 year. Conclusions: Prolonged physical therapy will result in resolution of stiffness in the vast majority of cases, often obviating the return to the operating room for capsular release and lysis of adhesions or mobilization under anesthesia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered to be the best non-invasive procedure for the evaluation of rotator cuff (RC) tendon tears. Burkhart's classification is a geometric classification of full-thickness RC tears on MRI. PURPOSE: To correlate MRI and arthroscopic geometric full-thickness RC tears according to the Burkhart's classification with pre- and postoperative clinical findings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients who underwent arthroscopic RC repair between 2006 and 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Preoperative MRI and arthroscopic surgical reports were reviewed for tear geometry (Burkhart's) by three (1 radiologist, 2 surgeons) and two (surgeons) readers. MRIs were also evaluated for tear size and change of tear size in successive sagittal sections and for muscle mass and fatty infiltration. Clinical examinations were performed preoperatively and at least 12 months afterwards. Postoperative function questionnaires were filled in by the patients. RESULTS: Forty-six patients (35 men, 11 women; mean age, 57 years; range, 41-72 years) were evaluated. Tears depicted on MRIs were classified as crescent in 11 patients (24%), longitudinal in three (6.5%), massive contracted in 29 (63%), and cuff arthropathy in three (6.5%). Muscle changes were noted almost exclusively in patients with massive tears and cuff arthropathy (16/32 patients, P = 0.013). MRIs and arthroscopic geometric classifications were in close agreement. Tear type did not correlate with pre- and postoperative physical examination or with postoperative clinical questionnaires scores. CONCLUSION: Geometric RC tear characterizations on preoperative MRIs were closely associated with arthroscopic findings. Postoperative results were not affected by the geometric pattern of the tears.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stiffness after a rotator cuff tear is common, and it affects postoperative prognosis. This study aims to define the factors affecting stiffness that accompanies rotator cuff tear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From June 2002 to May 2009 (84 months), 143 patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Of these, 119 were enrolled as subjects in this study. Preoperative range of motion was measured in all patients. Stiffness of the shoulder was defined as restriction of active and passive motion of 100degree of elevation or less, less than 50% of external rotation, and internal rotation only to the sacrum. Factors that can affect stiffness were evaluated, including the type, size, and direction of rotator cuff; duration of symptoms; gender; age; presence of accompanying medical disease; degenerative factors (Goutallier classification); and presence of trauma. Retrospective analysis was conducted accordingly. RESULTS: A statistically significantly higher degree of stiffness was seen for full-thickness tears than for partial-thickness tears (P = .0187). Between 2 groups that were divided by direction of rotator cuff tear, posterosuperior cuff tears showed a statistically significantly higher prevalence of stiffness (P = .0415). Patients with trauma had a statistically higher prevalence of stiffness (P = .0264). The other factors did not show significant differences. CONCLUSION: In patients with rotator cuff tear, the type and direction of rotator cuff tear and the presence of trauma seem to increase the limitation of preoperative joint range of motion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although some reports have presented short- to midterm results after arthroscopic repair of isolated subscapularis (SSC) tendon tears, long-term evaluation is still lacking. HYPOTHESIS: Long-term results after arthroscopic repair of isolated SSC tears are comparable with the functional and radiological short- to midterm outcomes described in the literature. STUDY DESIGN: Case series, Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: This study assessed 17 patients (5 females and 12 males; mean age, 45.6 years) with isolated SSC tears (Fox and Romeo classification types 2-4) who underwent all-arthroscopic suture anchor repair. The mean interval from symptom onset to the time of surgery was 5.3 months in 16 patients (94.1%). One patient (5.9%) was symptomatic for a prolonged period (104 months) before surgery. All patients were assessed with a clinical examination preoperatively. SSC function was investigated using specific clinical tests and common scoring systems, including Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), and Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores. At follow-up, muscular strength was evaluated using an electronic force-measuring plate. Structural integrity of the repair was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 98.4 +/- 19.9 months, the mean Constant score improved from 47.8 preoperatively to 74.2 postoperatively ( P = .001). Higher Constant ( P = .010) and ASES ( P = .001) scores were significantly associated with a shorter time from symptom onset to surgery. The size of the SSC lesion did not correlate with any clinical score outcome ( P = .476, .449, .985, and .823 for Constant, ASES, DASH, and SST scores, respectively). Three patients (17.6%) had persistent positive clinical test results (belly-press/lift-off). Compared with the uninjured contralateral side, SSC strength was significantly reduced in the belly-press position ( P = .031), although active internal ( P = .085) and external ( P = .093) rotation was not affected. In 1 patient, a rerupture was detected by MRI. Six patients had cranial SSC atrophy. Overall, 88.2% of patients were "very satisfied" or "satisfied" with their results. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic repair of isolated SSC tears results in significant clinical improvements and enduring tendon integrity, although SSC strength remains reduced in the long term. Early surgical treatment seems to be a relevant factor allowing good shoulder function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have identified factors that may affect the chances of rotator cuff healing after surgery. Intraoperative tendon quality may be used to predict healing and to determine type of repair and/or consideration of augmentation. There are no data that correlate how gross tendon morphology and degree of tendinopathy affect patient outcome or postoperative tendon healing. Purpose /Hypothesis: The purposes of this study were to (1) compare the gross appearance of the tendon edge during arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with its histological degree of tendinopathy and (2) determine if gross appearance correlated with postoperative repair integrity. The hypothesis was that gross (macroscopic) tendon with normal thickness, no delamination, and elastic tissue before repair would have a correlation with low Bonar scores, higher postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, and increased rates of postoperative tendon healing on ultrasound. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 105 patients undergoing repair of medium-size (1-3 cm) full-thickness rotator cuff tears were enrolled in the study. Intraoperatively, the supraspinatus tendon was rated on thickness, fraying, and stiffness. Tendon tissue was recovered for histological analysis based on the Bonar scoring system. Postoperative ASES and ultrasound assessment of healing were obtained 1 year after repair. Correlation between gross appearance of the tendon and rotator cuff histology was determined. RESULTS: Of the 105 patients, 85 were followed the study to completion. The mean age of the patients was 61.6 years; Bonar score, 7.5; preoperative ASES score, 49; and postoperative ASES score, 86. Ninety-one percent of repairs were intact on ultrasound. Gross appearance of torn rotator cuff tendon tissue did not correlate with histological appearance. Neither histological (Bonar) score nor gross appearance correlated with multivariate analysis of ASES score, postoperative repair status, or demographic data. CONCLUSION: The degree of tendinopathy did not correlate with morphological appearance of the tendon. Neither of these parameters correlated with healing or patient outcome. This study suggests that the degree of tendinopathy, unlike muscle atrophy, may not be predictive of outcomes and that, on appearance, poor quality tendon has adequate healing capacity. Therefore, abnormal gross tendon appearance should not affect the repair effort or technique.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biocomposite suture anchors containing osteoconductive materials have gained popularity in rotator cuff repairs. However, little is known about the influence of the addition of osteoconductive materials on implant resorption, bone reaction, tendon healing, and clinical outcomes scores. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What percentage of suture anchors were not completely resorbed 2 years after implantation? (2) What are the diameters of the bone bed in relation to the implant? (3) Is tendon integrity correlated with bone tunnel diameter? (4) Is there an association between tunnel widening, periimplant fluid film grade, biodegradation grade, and retear with clinical outcomes scores, such as the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) and the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS)? METHODS: Thirty-six patients were enrolled from August 2012 to January 2014. The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) reparable full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears, (2) double-row suture bridge techniques applied for supraspinatus repair, (3) use of biocomposites suture anchor implants composed of poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) exclusively, and (4) a minimum of 2 years followup. Four patients met the exclusion criteria, and seven of 36 patients (19%) were lost to followup. Thereby, 25 patients (84 implants) were included in this retrospective study. To answer the study's questions, the following methods were applied: (1) The resorption of the implants and periimplant fluid film were assessed on MRI using a four-stage scale system, (2) bone bed diameter was measured on MRI at three different points on the longitudinal central axis of each anchor, (3) tendon integrity was evaluated on MRI according to the Sugaya classification and correlated to bone tunnel diameter, and (4) assessed tunnel diameters, periimplant fluid film grade, biodegradation grade, and tendon condition were related to clinical outcomes scores at the time of followup (2.3 +/- 0.3 years). The intraobserver reliability was 0.981 (p < 0.001) and interobserver reliability was 0.895 (p < 0.001). RESULTS: At 2.3 +/- 0.3 years, most analyzed suture anchors (76 of 84 [90%]) were, with varying degrees of degradation, still visible. Bone tunnels showed minor widening (0.4 +/- 1.4 mm) at the base, but osseous ingrowth was detected as narrowing at the middle (0.1 +/- 1.1 mm) and at the apex (1.4 +/- 1.7 mm) of the implants. Patients with retears (Sugaya Grades 4-5) had narrower tunnels (3.6 +/- 1.8 mm) than patients without retears (Sugaya Grades 1-3; 4.4 +/- 1.6 mm; mean difference, 0.782 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.009-1.6]; p = 0.050). WORC and Oxford scores were not associated with the tunnel widening amount, fluid film grade, biodegradation grade, or tendon retear. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the results of the present study, surgeons should consider in their daily practice that the resorption process of these implants may be slower than assumed so far, but no association with severe implant-related complications has been found in the short term. Future studies should focus on the evaluation of the effects of osteoconductive materials on resorption, tendon healing, and clinical outcomes in the long term and on the integration process in different rotator cuff reconstruction techniques. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of revision arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery when compared with primary arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery in a large cohort of patients. Method(s): A consecutive series of 350 (300 primary and 50 revision) arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs performed by a single surgeon with a minimum of two years follow-up were retrospectively reviewed using prospectively collected data. With the 50 revision cases as a reference, three primary repair cases were chosen immediately before and three after each revision case. Standardized, patient-ranked outcomes, examiner determined assessments, and ultrasound determined rotator cuff integrity was assessed pre-operatively at six months and two years after surgery. Result(s): The revision group had a significantly larger pre-operative tear size (4.1 cm2 +/- 0.5 cm2)(mean +/- SEM) compared to the primary group (3.0 cm2 +/- 0.2 cm2)(p < 0.05). The mean age of the revision group (63years, range 43-80) was older compared to the primary group (60years, range 18-88)(p < 0.05).The re-tear rate for primary rotator cuff repair was 16% at 6 months and 21% at two years; while the re-tear rate for revision repair was 28% at six months and deteriorated to 40% at two years (p < 0.05). Two years after surgery the primary group reported less pain at rest (p < 0.02), during sleep (p < 0.03) and with overhead activity (p < 0.01) compared to the revision group. The primary group had better forward flexion (+13 Degrees, p<0.03), abduction (+18 Degrees, p < 0.01) and internal rotation (+2 vertebral levels, p < 0.001) compared to the revision group at two years after surgery. The primary group also had significantly greater strength (+15 N, p < 0.0004), lift-off strength (+9.3 N, p < 0.02) and adduction strength (+22 N, p < 0.003) compared to the revision group at two years. Conclusion(s): The short term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing revision rotator cuff repair were similar to primary rotator cuff repair. However, these results did not persist and by two years patients who had revision rotator cuff repair were twice as likely to have re-torn compared to those undergoing primary repair. The increase re-tear rate in the revision group at two years was associated with increased pain and impaired overhead function. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic rotator cuff tears are often treated surgically. However, there is a paucity of information regarding the outcomes of revision arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs. PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcome of revision arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery when compared with primary arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery in a large cohort of patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHOD: A consecutive series of 50 revision arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs performed by a single surgeon, with minimum 2-year follow-up, were retrospectively reviewed using prospectively collected data. As a comparison, 3 primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair cases (primary group; n = 310) were chosen immediately before each revision case, and 3 were chosen after. Standardized patient-ranked outcomes, examiner-determined assessments, and ultrasound-determined rotator cuff integrity were assessed preoperatively at 6 months and at a minimum of 2 years after surgery. RESULTS: The revision group was older (mean age, 63 years; range, 43-80 years) compared with the primary group (mean age, 60 years; range, 18-88 years) (P < .05) and had larger tear size (mean +/- SEM) (4.1 +/- 0.5 cm(2)) compared with the primary group (3.0 +/- 0.2 cm(2)) (P < .05). Two years after surgery, the primary group reported less pain at rest (P < .02), during sleep (P < .05), and with overhead activity (P < .01) compared with the revision group. The primary group had better passive forward flexion (+13degree; P < .05), abduction (+18degree; P < .01), internal rotation (+2 vertebral levels; P < .001) and also significantly greater supraspinatus strength (+15 N; P < .001), lift-off strength (+9.3 N; P < .05), and adduction strength (+20 N; P < .01) compared with the revision group at 2 years. When compared with the primary group, the revision group was more satisfied with the overall shoulder function before surgery but was less satisfied with their shoulder function than the primary group at 2 years (P < .005). The retear rate for primary rotator cuff repair was 16% at 6 months and 21% at 2 years, while the retear rate for revision rotator cuff repair was 28% at 6 months and deteriorated to 40% at 2 years (P < .05). CONCLUSION: The short-term clinical outcomes of patients undergoing revision rotator cuff repair were similar to those after primary rotator cuff repair. However, these results did not persist, and by 2 years patients who had revision rotator cuff repair were twice as likely to have retorn compared with those undergoing primary repair. The increase in retear rate in the revision group at 2 years was associated with increased pain, impaired overhead function, less passive motion, weaker strength, and less overall satisfaction with shoulder function.

AB  - PURPOSE: This retrospective study aimed to report repair integrity and clinical outcomes after arthroscopic suture bridge subscapularis (SSC) tendon repair. METHODS: The subjects included 101 shoulders subjected to arthroscopic suture bridge repair for full-thickness SSC tear with a minimum of a 2-year follow-up. There were 57 men and 44 women with a mean age of 66 years (range, 32-85 years). The mean follow-up was 30 months (range, 24-71 months). Tenotomy or tenodesis was performed for the long head of the biceps in all cases. All patients were assessed for active range of motion; belly-press and bear-hug tests; University of California, Los Angeles score; and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score preoperatively and at the final follow-up. Repair integrity and fatty degeneration of the SSC muscle were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging at a mean 14 months (range, 12-58 months) after surgery. RESULTS: Flexion, internal rotation, and both functional scores significantly improved after surgery. Retears were found in 5 shoulders (5%). The shoulders with a retear showed significantly inferior functional scores compared with the intact shoulders. Fatty degeneration was significantly improved in the intact group, whereas there was no significant improvement in the retear group. Both belly-press and bear-hug test scores significantly improved after surgery; however, weakness persisted in shoulders with higher grade preoperative fatty degeneration even after successful repair. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic suture bridge repair for SSC tears yielded good clinical outcomes and a very low retear rate, even for larger tears or shoulders with higher grade fatty degeneration. Fatty degeneration of the SSC muscle improved after successful repair, although internal rotation weakness persisted in shoulders with higher grade preoperative fatty degeneration. Arthroscopic suture bridge repair is a promising procedure for treating SSC tears. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, case series study.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate preoperative and intraoperative factors associated with rotator cuff tears (RCTs) among patients younger than 50 years and to compare arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) results in patients younger than 50 years (group A) and patients older than 70 years (group B). We also analyzed the results after arthroscopic RCR in these 2 age groups. METHODS: Data were collected from 56 patients allocated to group A and 55 patients allocated to group B who had medium-sized RCTs and had undergone arthroscopic RCR between January 2006 and August 2015. Preoperative variables included demographic data, radiologic data, and surgical procedure. We evaluated fatty degeneration on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intraoperative variables, including concomitant subscapularis repair, as well as repair technique. Pain visual analog scale, functional visual analog scale, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and Constant scores were documented to compare functional results in each age group. Postoperative MRI scans were conducted to evaluate the retear rate after RCR after a mean postoperative duration of 5.4 months (range, 2-48 months). RESULTS: Multivariate regression analysis showed acute-on-chronic injury and a history of hypertension were independent factors for differentiation of the groups. Stepwise regression analysis found sex, hypertension, and fatty infiltration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus to be comparable factors for each group. All patients showed improved results after arthroscopic RCR, but there was no difference between the 2 groups in functional outcomes. However, cuff retears on postoperative MRI scans were found in only 3.9% of the patients in group A versus 16% of the patients in group B. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed that sex, acute-on-chronic injury, and preoperative fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff were significant factors affecting medium-sized RCTs in patients younger than 50 years. In addition, there were no significant differences in functional outcomes after arthroscopic RCR in both groups at 2 years, but postoperative MRI showed a lower retear rate in group A. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.

AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of the study is to determine clinical and radiological outcomes of arthroscopic repair for delaminated tears versus non-delaminated tears. METHODS: Consecutive 138 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tear were retrospectively enrolled. They were divided into two groups based on the presence of delamination. All delaminated tears were repaired by en bloc technique (suturing both layers by single stitch). Delaminated tears were categorized into two types: (1) posterior type, delamination involving mainly infraspinatus and (2) complete type, delamination involving both supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Clinical assessments were done using pain visual analog scale (PVAS), functional VAS, American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons score, the Constant score, and range of motion. Postoperative MRI was performed at 6 months after surgery to determine repair integrity. RESULTS: Of the 138 patients, 78 (56.5%) had delaminated tears, including 30 cases of posterior type and 48 cases of complete type. The retear rate was 6.7% (4/60) in the non-delamination group and 5.1% (4/78) in the delamination group, showing no significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in Sugaya classification between the two groups. Clinical scores were improved significantly in both delamination and non-delamination groups postoperatively, showing no significant difference between the two groups. Delamination subgroup (posterior or complete type) showed no significant correlation with retear rate, Sugaya classification, or clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic en bloc repair for delaminated rotator cuff tear showed no significant difference in clinical or radiological outcome from that for non-delaminated rotator cuff tear. The extent of delamination did not affect outcome either. Levels of Evidence: Level III, Retrospective comparative study.

AB  - Background: Patients who sustain a rotator cuff retear after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair are generally considered to have worse clinical outcomes compared with patients with an intact rotator cuff. However, some patients have good clinical outcomes, even with a retorn rotator cuff. Purpose: To report the clinical outcomes of nonoperative treatment for rotator cuff retears and analyze the factors affecting clinical outcomes after a retear. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between 2011 and 2017 were reviewed, and those with a full-thickness retear on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were included in this study. According to their pre- and postoperative scores on the pain visual analog scale (pVAS) and functional visual analog scale (fVAS), the patients were divided into 3 groups: (1) mild group (pVAS <= 1 and fVAS >= 8), (2) moderate group (pVAS <= 1 and fVAS <= 7 or pVAS 2-3 and fVAS >= 8), and (3) severe group (pVAS >= 3 and fVAS <= 7). Preoperative data (dominant hand involvement, heavy labor) and tear size on 6-month postoperative MRI were analyzed as factors affecting clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 712 patients were reviewed, and a retear was observed in 62 patients (8.7%). Of the patients with retears, 52 were included in this study: 25 men and 27 women with a mean age of 62.6 years (range, 49-80 years) and mean follow-up period of 40 months (range, 24-88 months). According to the pVAS and fVAS scores, 25 patients (48.1%) were classified into the mild group, 9 (17.3%) into the moderate group, and 18 (34.6%) into the severe group. There were no significant differences in preoperative data among the 3 groups. The tear size in the coronal and sagittal planes decreased by 5.1 and 6.6 mm, respectively, in the mild group but increased by 2.8 and 1.4 mm, respectively, in the severe group. Conclusion: In patients with retears, 48.1% had only mild symptoms at a mean of 40 months postoperatively. Patients with severe symptoms tended to have an increased tear size on postoperative MRI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid injections have been widely used for reducing shoulder pain. However, catastrophic complications induced by corticosteroid such as infections and tendon degeneration have made surgeons hesitant to use a corticosteroid injection as a pain control modality, especially during the postoperative recovery phase. PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness and safety of a subacromial corticosteroid injection for persistent pain control during the recovery period and to analyze the factors causing persistent pain after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 458 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were included in this study. Patient-specific parameters, tear size and pattern, and pain intensity were reviewed. Seventy-two patients were administered a postoperative subacromial corticosteroid injection under ultrasound guidance. The corticosteroid injection was administered to patients who awakened overnight because of constant severe shoulder pain or whose pain was exacerbated at the time of rehabilitation exercises within 8 weeks after surgery. Pain intensity, patient satisfaction, and functional outcomes using the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant scores were compared between the patients with and without a subacromial corticosteroid injection. The retear rate was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: In patients with an injection, the mean (+/-SD) visual analog scale for pain (pVAS) score was 7.7 +/- 1.2 at the time of the injection. This significantly decreased to 2.3 +/- 1.4 at the end of the first month after the injection, demonstrating a 70.2% reduction in pain (P < .01). At 3 months after the injection, the mean pVAS score was 1.2 +/- 1.8. Functional outcomes at final follow-up showed no significant differences between patients with and without an injection (ASES score: 90.1 +/- 14.6 with injection, 91.9 +/- 8.2 without injection [P = .91]; Constant score: 89.1 +/- 12.9 with injection, 84.5 +/- 13.0 without injection [P = .17]). Patients with an injection showed no significant increase in the retear rate (6.8% with injection, 18.4% without injection; P = .06). According to the tear pattern, L-shaped rotator cuff tears (41.8%) showed a higher occurrence of severe postoperative persistent pain. Preoperative shoulder stiffness was revealed as a predisposing factor for persistent pain (odds ratio, 0.2; P = .04). CONCLUSION: A subacromial corticosteroid injection can be considered as a useful and safe modality for the treatment of patients having severe persistent pain during the recovery phase after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to find independent prognostic factors related to retear of the rotator cuff tendon in patients with repaired full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear by evaluation of pre- and postoperative MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Shoulder MR images were retrospectively analyzed for 83 patients who had undergone arthroscopic or open rotator cuff repair with acromioplasty for full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear from April 2014 to March 2015. On preoperative MR images, the type of rotator cuff tear, extent of retraction of torn tendon, anteroposterior (AP) dimension of torn tendon, signal intensity of tear edge, degree of fat infiltration in supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, and acromiohumeral interval (AHI) were assessed. Postoperative cuff integrity seen on MR images was classified into five categories according to the Sugaya classification system, and patients were categorized into retear or intact groups. Factors assessed on preoperative MR images were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The overall retear rate was 57.8%. Significant differences were observed between the retear and intact groups in terms of the mean values of the extent of tendon retraction (20.4 vs 11.7 mm), AP dimension of the tear (16.1 vs 11.4 mm), AHI (6.8 vs 8.7 mm), and degree of fat infiltration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles (for the supraspinatus muscle, 3, 30, and 15 patients in the retear group vs 5, 27, and three patients in the intact group had Goutallier grade 1, grade 2, and grades 3 and 4 infiltration, respectively; for the infraspinatus muscle, 27, 12, and 9 patients in the retear group vs 29, 5, and one patient in the intact group had Goutallier grade 1, grade 2, and grades 3 and 4 infiltration, respectively). Multivariable analysis revealed that AHI and degree of tendon retraction were independent predictive factors affecting retear of rotator cuff after repair. CONCLUSION: The retear rate of repaired rotator cuff tendon was about 57.8%. Independent prognostic factors of retear were degree of tendon retraction and AHI on preoperative MR images.

AB  - Introduction: Shoulder arthroscopies are among the most frequently performed surgeries by orthopaedic surgeons. Little is known about complication rates among recently trained surgeons. The purpose of this study was to examine the type and frequency of complications of common arthroscopic shoulder procedures performed by candidates challenging the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery: Part II, certification examination. Methods: Data were obtained from the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery database for orthopaedic surgeons who sat for the part II examination from 2012 to 2016. In total, 27,072 procedures were reviewed. The database was queried to determine the type and frequency of complications for patients who underwent shoulder arthroscopy, including arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, labrum repair, biceps tenodesis, and bony/soft tissue debridement procedures. Complications were classified as surgical, anesthetic, or medical. Factors affecting complication rates were investigated including surgeon's fellowship training, geographic location, and patients' age and sex. Results: Patients with surgical complications (n = 2,133; 7.9%) were more common than anesthetic (n = 263; 1.0%) or medical (n = 607; 2.2%) complications. There was a significant variation in the surgical complication rate among different arthroscopic shoulder procedures, ranging from 5.4% for labral repair to 10.3% for rotator cuff repair and biceps tenodesis. Stiffness/arthrofibrosis was the most commonly recorded surgical complication (2.2%). Surgical complication rates were lowest in the Northeast region (6.7%; P < 0.01) and in patients younger than 21 years (3.8%; P < 0.01). Women had significantly higher rate of complications than men (8.4% versus 7.6%; P = 0.02). Among anesthetic-related complications, 61.6% were related to regional nerve blocks. The overall revision surgery and readmission rates were 0.8% and 1.0%, respectively. Conclusion: The overall self-reported surgical complication rate for arthroscopic shoulder procedures was 7.9%, which is higher than the rates reported in the literature. Although the rate of anesthetic complications is low (1.0%), adverse events related to nerve blocks made up most of the overall anesthetic related complications.

AB  - Background: The surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears traditionally involves rotator cuff repair (RCR) with concomitant acromioplasty. However, there is some doubt as to whether acromioplasty is of value to this procedure. Questions/Purpose: We sought to evaluate whether RCR with acromioplasty provided better outcomes than RCR without acromioplasty in a cohort of more than 1000 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study involved 1320 patients with rotator cuff tears who subsequently received a primary arthroscopic RCR, with acromioplasty (n = 160) or without acromioplasty (n = 1160), performed by a single surgeon. Acromioplasty was performed if there was significant mechanical impingement on the rotator cuff. To assess outcomes, all patients completed a standardized, modified L'Insalata questionnaire in which they reported the level and severity of pain at rest and during activities. An examiner assessed shoulder strength and range of motion before and 1 week, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after surgery. Results: Patients who had RCR with concurrent acromioplasty had a greater level of pain and more frequent pain 1 week after surgery. However, at 6 months there were no differences between patients who underwent RCR with or without acromioplasty in any patient-reported outcome (level of pain with overhead activity, at rest and during sleep; frequency of pain with activity, sleep and extreme pain, difficulty of activity overhead and behind back, level of shoulder stiffness; and overall shoulder satisfaction). The postoperative re-tear rate in both groups was 13%. Conclusion: This study showed no additional benefit to acromioplasty in patients undergoing RCR.

AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Repair techniques for rotator cuff injury are currently well advanced. However, the risk of re-rupture, particularly when severe damage to the tendons has been repaired, is still high. The causes of failure can be due to the extent of injury, a repair done on a highly degenerated tendon with diminished viability or ischaemic damage to the tendon tissue resulting from suture material. The aim of the study was to ascertain the reliability of the tangent sign, a commonly used indicator of the degree of suprasupinatus muscle atrophy, in the prediction of risk for tendon re-rupture in the post-operative period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2011 the rotator cuff torn tendons were repaired by the method of double-row suture in 37 patients. The surgery was done by an open technique using the deltoid-splitting approach. A pre-operative magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the shoulder was obtained in all patients and each was assessed by a competent independent radiology specialist with a focus on the extent of a tendon lesion and the tangent sign. At 2-year follow-up, the results of repeated MRI were evaluated in view of the state of repaired tendons and, if a re-tear was found, its relation to the original suture and its extent in the sagittal plane were determined. The pre- and post-operative MRI findings were compared to find out how the presence or absence of a tangent sign before surgery relates to the incidence of supraspinatus tendon re-rupture at 2 years after surgery. The results were statistically analysed using Student's t-test and the Chi-square test. RESULTS: Of the 37 shoulders, in the pre-operative period, a tangent sign was identified in 21 (56.8%). The average size of a rotator cuff tear was 29.3 mm for the whole group. For the shoulders with no tangent sign, the average value was 21.8 mm, for those with a tangent sign present, it was 39.6 mm. At 2-year follow-up, no tear was found in the patients in whom preoperative MRI showed no tangent sign while re-tears were recorded in 18 of 21 shoulders (85.7%) with a tangent sign present before surgery. On the average, the re-rupture had 40.8 mm in size and, in all cases, it occurred at the site of tendon re-insertion into the greater tubercle. These results were statistically significant (p < 0.01). DISCUSSION: In repair of injury to the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles, emphasis is currently placed on a thorough pre-operative examination. MRI is an important part of the diagnostic procedure because it provides a detailed image of the muscle as a whole. Although great advances have recently been made in both the diagnostic and surgical techniques, the incidence of tendon re-rupture within a few years of the procedure is still high. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the presence of a tangent sign detected by pre-operative MRI examination of the shoulder can be an important predictor of failure in rotator cuff repair and can also turn attention to the selection of an alternative technique to be used.

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) may be associated with the etiology of rotator cuff disease; however, its effect on healing after surgical rotator cuff repair (RCR) is not well characterized. The purposes of this study are to analyze the association between DM and surgical RCR, the association between DM and revision RCR after RCR, and the association between DM and the cost of RCR. Methods: A retrospective analysis of claims data of privately and publicly insured subjects from the Truven Health MarketScan database from 2008 to 2017 was conducted, collecting RCR cases and controls matched for age, sex, year of RCR, and first and last year in the database. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare DM incidence within the RCR and control groups after adjusting for all matching variables plus region, insurance plan type, tobacco use, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare rates of revision RCR between DM and non-DM groups after adjusting for patient age, sex, year of RCR, plan type, and CCI. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze RCR cost, and exponentiated regression coefficients were reported to represent cost ratios. Results: The full analysis cohort consisted of 292,666 RCR cases and matched controls. The adjusted odds of having RCR surgery in diabetic patients was 48% higher (odds ratio = 1.48 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.46 to 1.51], P < .001) than nondiabetics. DM was not significantly associated with revision RCR after RCR when adjusting for age, sex, region, plan type, tobacco use, year of RCR, and CCI (hazard ratio = 1.03, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.07, P = .17). Diabetes was associated with a higher cost of RCR by 3% (ratio = 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.03, P < .001). Conclusions: Diabetic patients are at a higher risk of undergoing RCR surgery; however, there is no association between DM and subsequent rotator cuff revision surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anchored transosseous equivalent suture-bridge technique (TOE) is widely used for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. It is unknown how patient outcomes scores, ROM, and integrity of the rotator cuff after repair using this anchored technique compare with those after repair using an anchorless transosseous technique (TO). QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What are the differences in patient-reported outcomes (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] score) and shoulder ROM between TO and TOE rotator cuff repair techniques at 1 and 2 years after surgery? (2) What is the difference in repair integrity as measured by the re-tear rate, assessed ultrasonographically at 1 year, between these two techniques? (3) What is the difference in procedure duration between the two techniques when performed by a surgeon familiar with each? METHODS: We reviewed 331 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs performed by one surgeon from December 2011 to July 2016 in this retrospective, matched-pair study. Of these patients, 63% (208 of 331) underwent repair with standard anchored technique (anchors placed in a double-row, TOE manner) and 37% (123 of 331) underwent anchorless TO repair, with the same indications for surgery between groups. Forty-four percent (91 of 208) of patients in the TOE group and 61% (75 of 123) of patients in the TO group met the inclusion criteria. Eighty percent (73 of 91) of patients in the TOE group and 88% (66 of 75) in the TO group had minimum 2-year follow-up. We matched each group to a cohort of 50 patients by sex, age, smoking status, and tear size (by Cofield classification: small, < 1 cm; medium, 1-3 cm; large, > 3-5 cm; or massive, > 5 cm). The resulting cohorts did not differ in mean age (TO, 62 years [range 53-65 years]; TOE, 58 years [range 53-65 years]; p = 0.79), mean BMI value (TO, 30 [range 27-33]; TOE, 29 [range 27-35]; p = 0.97), or dominant arm involvement (TO, 80%; TOE, 78%; p = 0.81). The cohorts were followed for at least 2 years (median, 3.2 years [interquartile range (IQR) 2.2-4.3] for TO and 2.9 years [IQR 2.0-3.5 years] for TOE). ASES scores and ROM were evaluated before surgery and at follow-up visits and were recorded in a longitudinally maintained institutional database. Repair integrity was assessed using ultrasonography at 1 year, as is standard in our practice. For each tear-size group, we calculated the proportion of intact tendon repairs versus the proportion of re-tears. Duration of surgery was recorded for each patient. RESULTS: At 1 year, we observed no difference in median ASES scores (90 [IQR 92-98] for TO and 88 [IQR 72-98] for TOE; p = 0.44); external rotation (50degree [IQR 45degree-60degree) for TO and 50degree [IQR: 40degree-60degree] for TOE; p = 0.58); forward flexion (165degree [IQR 160degree-170degree] for both groups; p = 0.91); or abduction (100degree [IQR 90degree-100degree] for TO and 90degree [IQR 90degree-100degree] for TOE; p = 0.06). Fourteen percent of shoulders (seven of 50) in each treatment group had evidence of re-tear at 1 year (p > 0.99): 0 of 2 small tears in each group, 0 of 7 medium tears in each group, five of 32 large tears in each group, and two of 9 massive tears in each group (all, p > 0.99). At 2 years, we found no differences in median ASES scores (92 [IQR 74-98)] for TO and 90 [IQR 80-100] for TOE; p = 0.84); external rotation (60degree [IQR 50degree-60degree] for both groups; p = 0.74); forward flexion (170degree [IQR 160degree-170degree] for both groups; p = 0.69); or abduction (100degree [IQR 90degree-100degree] for both groups; p = 0.95). We found no differences between groups in mean +/- SD procedure time, which was 103 +/- 20 minutes for TO repair and 99 +/- 20 minutes for TOE repair (p = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: TO and TOE techniques for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair results in no differences in ROM, ASES scores, re-tear rates, and surgical time. Randomized control trials are needed to confirm these similarities or determine a superior method of repair. Future cost analyses may also help to determine the relative value of each technique. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: So far, recurrent rotator cuff defects are described to occur in the early postoperative period after arthroscopic repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate the musculotendinous structure of the supraspinatus, as well as bone marrow edema or osteolysis after arthroscopic double-row repair. Therefore, magnetic resonance (MR) images were performed at defined intervals up to 2 years postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 3. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging was performed within 7 days, 3, 6, 12, 26, 52 and 108 weeks after surgery. All patients were operated using an arthroscopic modified suture bridge technique. Tendon integrity, tendon retraction ["foot-print-coverage" (FPC)], muscular atrophy and fatty infiltration (signal intensity analysis) were measured at all time points. Furthermore, postoperative bone marrow edema and signs of osteolysis were assessed. RESULTS: MR images of 13 non-consecutive patients (6f/7m, age 61.05 +/- 7.7 years) could be evaluated at all time points until 108 weeks postoperatively. 5/6 patients with recurrent defect at final follow-up displayed a time of failure between 12 and 24 months after surgery. Predominant mode of failure was medial cuff failures in 4/6 cases. The initial FPC increased significantly up to 2 years follow-up (p = 0.004). Evaluations of muscular atrophy or fatty infiltration were not significant different comparing the results of all time points (p > 0.05). Postoperative bone marrow edema disappeared completely at 6 months after surgery, whereas signs of osteolysis appeared at 3 months follow-up and increased to final follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent defects after arthroscopic reconstruction of supraspinatus tears in modified suture bridge technique seem to occur between 12 and 24 months after surgery. Serial MRI evaluation shows good muscle structure at all time points. Postoperative bone marrow edema disappears completely several months after surgery. Signs of osteolysis seem to appear caused by bio-absorbable anchor implantations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Full-thickness rotator cuff tears remain a significant cause of pain and dysfunction in the elderly. Substantial improvement in pain and functional outcomes with arthroscopic cuff repair is possible. Recent data has shown that patients older than 70-75 years still have clinical improvement with operative rotator cuff repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients aged >=75 years undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at a minimum of 24 months after surgery. Outcome measurements included range of motion (ROM), visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES) scores, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) scores, and Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) scores. Reoperation and rates of conversion to reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients were included with an average follow-up of 56.9 +/- 25.9 months (range 24-127 months). Six (7.2%) patients had additional surgery, including 3 revision rotator cuff repairs for retear, 2 conversion to RSA, and 1 capsular release and loose anchor removal. There were statistically significant improvements in shoulder ROM, ASES, SANE, VAS, and SF-12 scores postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Rotator cuff repair in select patients aged >=75 years results in reliable improvements in pain and function. There was a low reoperation rate or conversion to RSA (7.2%) at midterm follow-up. This study indicates a role for rotator cuff repair in an elderly population and argues against the routine use of reverse arthroplasty for repairable rotator cuff tears in this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of reversed arthroscopic subacromial decompression in the treatment of rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Between November 2012 and January 2015, 53 patients with rotator cuff tears were treated with reversed arthroscopic subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair. Of 53 patients, 38 were male and 15 were female, with the age of 47-61 years (mean, 53.4 years). The injury was caused by falling in 36 cases and other in 17 cases without an obvious history of trauma. All patients had shoulder pain and limited shoulder movement before operation. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was 6.4+/-0.9, and University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score was 16.3+/-1.9. MRI showed that distal supraspinatus tear was observed in 41 cases and distal infraspinatus tear in 12 cases; partial-thickness rotator cuff tear was observed in 9 cases and full-thickness tear in 44 cases. And the tear size was from 1 to 3 cm (mean, 1.9 cm). Combined injuries included tendinitis of long head of biceps brachii in 31 cases, Bankart lesion in 5 cases, and superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion in 2 cases. RESULTS: Incision healed by first intention in all patients; no infection or nerve injury occurred. Forty-nine cases were followed up from 12 to 35 months (mean, 22.8 months). After operation, shoulder pain relief was achieved in 42 cases; 7 cases had anterior shoulder pain at 3 months after operation, which was relieved after symptomatic treatment. At last follow-up, VAS score was significantly decreased to 0.5+/-0.6 (t=40.565, P=0.000). UCLA score was significantly increased to 33.8+/-1.7 (t=-79.799, P=0.000). The results were excellent in 42 cases, good in 6 cases, and fair in 1 case; the excellent and good rate was 98.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Reversed arthroscopic subacromial decompression can avoid coracoacromial arch injury and achieve good recovery of joint function, so it can be used in rotator cuff tears procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) have been reported, few studies have focused on diabetic patients. We investigated and compared the clinical results of ARCR in patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: This retrospective study involved 195 consecutive patients who underwent ARCR from 2015 to 2018 in our hospital. Twenty-seven and 168 shoulders were assigned to diabetes and non-diabetes groups, respectively. Diabetic patients with poor control were preoperatively hospitalized for perioperative diabetic control. We evaluated range of motion (ROM), Japanese Orthopaedic Association shoulder (JOA) score, Constant Shoulder Score, and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score preoperatively and at 6 months and 1 year post-ARCR. Rates of rotator cuff retear 1 year post-ARCR and preoperative and postoperative stiff shoulder were also evaluated. We compared the results between groups and analyzed them statistically. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Preoperative ROM, JOA score, Constant Shoulder Score and UCLA scores showed significant improvement at post-ARCR in both groups (p < 0.05). On comparing the groups, although preoperative JOA score and Constant Shoulder Score were significantly lower in diabetes group than in non-diabetes group (diabetic/non-diabetic group; 60.0/65.3 for JOA score; p = 0.003, 59.7/64.2 for Constant Shoulder Score; p = 0.003), there was no significant difference postoperatively (6 months post-ARCR; 88.0/89.7 for JOA score; p = 0.783, 88.1/88.6 for Constant Shoulder Score; p = 0.597, 1 year post-ARCR; 96.7/95.4 for JOA score; p = 0.238, 96.6/95.4 for Constant Shoulder Score; p = 0.248). Furthermore, preoperative and postoperative stiff shoulder and retear rates were not significantly different between groups (p = 0.152, p = 0.344, p = 0.347, and p = 0.563, respectively). CONCLUSION: Diabetic patients showed comparable clinical results with non-diabetic patients post-ARCR. Perioperative diabetic control may be recommended for preoperatively uncontrolled diabetic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 failure is a big issue after suture-bridge rotator cuff repair, which may be because of stress concentration at the medial row stitches. We have been performing medial knot-tying after suture-bridge lateral row repair to avoid the stress concentration. This study aimed to evaluate clinical and radiological outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using this technique. HYPOTHESIS: This technique would yield better radiological outcomes with a reduced type 2 failure rate compared with reported outcomes after conventional suture-bridge repair. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: The inclusion criteria of this study were (1) full-thickness tears, (2) primary surgery, and (3) minimum 2-year follow-up with pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated active ranges of motion (forward elevation and external rotation), as well as the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), scores preoperatively and at the final follow-up. RESULTS: This study included 384 shoulders in 373 patients (205 men and 168 women) with a mean age of 65 years (range, 24-89 years) at the time of surgery. The mean follow-up was 29 months (range, 24-60 months). There were 91 small, 137 medium, 121 large, and 35 massive tears. Postoperative MRI scans demonstrated successful repair in 324 shoulders (84.4%, group S) and retear in 60 shoulders (15.6%). Among 60 retears, 40 shoulders (67%) had type 1 failure (group F1) and 20 shoulders (33%) had type 2 failure (group F2). Forward elevation and external rotation significantly improved after surgery (P < .001 for both). Postoperative JOA and UCLA scores in group F2 were significantly lower than those in the other groups. CONCLUSION: The medial knot-tying after suture-bridge lateral row repair demonstrated excellent functional and radiological outcomes after surgery, with a retear rate of 15.6%. The type 2 failure showed significantly inferior functional outcomes; however, the rate of type 2 failure was less relative to previous studies using conventional suture-bridge techniques. Our technique could be a good alternative to conventional suture-bridging rotator cuff repair because it may reduce the rate of postoperative type 2 failure.

AB  - PURPOSE: The Stump classification is significantly correlated with a retear after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. However, no study has evaluated whether or not the stump classification is correlated with retear in the suture-bridge or double-row repair techniques. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between a retear and the stump classification in the suture-bridge and double-row repair techniques. METHODS: Among 389 patients who underwent arthroscopic repairs of full-thickness rotator cuff tears using suture-bridge or double-row repair techniques, 326 patients (median age 67.0 years; range 25-85) were included. There were 51 small, 172 medium, 83 large, and 20 massive tears. Two hundred forty patients were treated with the suture-bridge technique, and 86 patients were treated with the double-row technique. The following variables were analyzed: age, sex, the Cofield classification, anteroposterior and mediolateral tear size on preoperative MRI, global fatty degeneration index, and the stump classification. Cuff integrity was evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months after surgery. The patients were divided into the intact and retear groups and the relationship between the variables and retear was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The overall retear rate was 10.1%. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the independent predictors of a retear were the stump classification type 3 (Odds ratio: 4.71, p = 0.0246), global fatty degeneration index (Odds ratio: 3.87, p = 0.0030), and anteroposterior tear size (Odds ratio: 1.07, p = 0.0077) in the suture bridge technique. In the double-row technique, the independent predictors of retear were stump classification type 3 (Odds ratio: 7.82, p = 0.0348), and age (Odds ratio: 1.22, p = 0.0163). CONCLUSION: The stump classification was significantly correlated with retear in the suture-bridge and double-row repair technique. Stump classification type 3 was indicated to be an important risk factor for predicting retear. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to compare the re-tear rates and clinical results between mini-open and full arthroscopic techniques of the rotator cuff repair. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed a total of 82 patients. Mini-open and full arthroscopic techniques were performed in 30 patients (group MO) and 52 patients (group A), respectively. The main outcome measurements were the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores, abduction and external rotation strengths (kg), and re-tear rate on magnetic resonance arthrography. All variables were compared between the groups. Result(s): The mean age of all patients included in the study was 55.4+/-6.1 years. Sixty (73.2%) patients were female. The mean follow-up was 12.3+/-1.4 months. The mean UCLA and ASES scores and external rotation strength in group A were significantly higher than in group MO. The mean abduction strengths were similar. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of re-tear rates. Conclusion(s): Rotator cuff tears can be successfully treated with either mini-open or arthroscopic techniques. Although there was no statistically significant difference in re-tear rates, full arthroscopic repair had better functional outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with rotator cuff tears often recall a specific initiating event (traumatic), whereas many cannot (nontraumatic). It is unclear how important a history of trauma is to the outcomes of rotator cuff repair. METHODS: This question was addressed in a study cohort of 1300 consecutive patients who completed a preoperative questionnaire regarding their shoulder injury and had a systematic evaluation of shoulder range of motion and strength, a primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair performed by a single surgeon, an ultrasound scan, and the same subjective and objective measurements made of their shoulder 6 months after surgery. Post hoc, this cohort was separated into 2 groups: those who reported no history of trauma on presentation (n = 489) and those with a history of traumatic injury (n = 811). RESULTS: The retear rate in the group with no history of trauma was 12%, whereas that of the group with a history of trauma was 14% (P = .36). Those patients with a history of shoulder trauma who waited longer than 24 months had higher retear rates (20%) than those who had their surgery earlier (13%) (P = .040). CONCLUSION: Recollection of a traumatic initiating event had little effect on the outcome of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Duration of symptoms was important in predicting retears if patients recalled a specific initiating event but not in patients who did not recall any specific initiating event. Patients with a history of trauma should be encouraged to have their rotator cuff tear repaired within 2 years.

AB  - Background: This study was conducted to determine if there is an association between an intraoperative glenohumeral synovitis score (GHSS) and postoperative shoulder stiffness in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). Methods: Intraoperative GHSS was collected retrospectively from standardized arthroscopic images on consecutive patients undergoing primary ARCR. Range of motion was collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 3 and 6 months. Results: 290 consecutive patients underwent primary ARCR. At three-months follow-up, 32 (11.0%) patients had glenohumeral stiffness. Patients with stiffness had significantly higher mean GHSS. Conclusion: Higher intraoperative GHSS was associated with early postoperative shoulder stiffness at three-months after ARCR.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the retear rate and retear pattern after double-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (DR-ARCR) with the use of absorbable sutures as medial anchor sutures and to address the advantage of the use of absorbable sutures in medial-row anchors. METHODS: Fifty-seven shoulders (22 male and 35 female patients; mean age, 66.1 years) with complete rotator cuff tears treated with DR-ARCR using absorbable mattress sutures as medial-row anchor sutures were included in the study. They included 35 medium, 17 large, and 5 massive tears. For the medial row, medial anchor sutures were replaced with absorbable mattress sutures. High-strength simple sutures were used for the lateral anchors. We evaluated retear patterns by magnetic resonance imaging examinations performed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. The clinical conditions of all patients preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively were assessed by the University of California, Los Angeles rating scale and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder index. RESULTS: A complete retear of the tendon at the footprint was observed in 5 shoulders. Complete discontinuity at the middle of the tendon around the medial-row anchors with a footprint remnant was observed in 1 shoulder. A thinned repaired rotator cuff was observed in 2 shoulders because of a partial retear of the deep layer. The overall retear rate was 14%. From before to after surgery, the University of California, Los Angeles score significantly improved from 18.4 to 32.9 (P < .0001) and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons index improved from 55.1 to 87.7 (P < .0001). No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The retear rates after DR-ARCR with absorbable sutures as medial-row anchors were 8.8% for complete retears of the tendon at the footprint and 1.7% for complete discontinuity of tendon around the medial-row anchors. This procedure provided a low retear rate around the medial-row anchors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic case series.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the structural and clinical results between the knotless suture bridge (SB) and triple-row (TR) techniques. METHODS: This study is a retrospective study and included 212 shoulders with repairable rotator cuff tears treated with the SB technique and 206 shoulders treated with the TR technique. In the TR technique, medial and lateral anchors were placed as they would be for the SB technique, with a middle row anchor added on the edge of footprint to reduce the torn tendons. All patients underwent primary arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and had magnetic resonance imaging 6 months postoperatively to evaluate for retear. Sugaya's classification was used to classify the retear pattern. The function of all patients preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively were assessed by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons shoulder index and the University of California at Los Angeles rating scale. RESULTS: According to Sugaya's classification, 24 (11.3%), 6 (2.8%), and 20 (9.4%) in SB-treated shoulders and 16 (7.8%), 12 (5.8%), and 8 (3.9%) in TR-treated shoulders, respectively had types 3, 4, and 5. There was a statistically significant greater type 5 retear in SB-treated shoulders (P = .038) than in TR-treated shoulders. The average clinical outcome scores at the final follow-up improved significantly relative to those before the surgeries in both groups. There were no statistical differences in the clinical outcome scores at the final follow-up between SB and TR groups. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the TR technique in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair resulted in a lower large-size retear rate when compared with the use of the SB technique. No clinical differences were noted in the outcomes between the 2 groups. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic, retrospective cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair provides satisfactory results; however, there is still a high rate of re-tear. The objective of this study was to present a surface-holding technique that we recently developed for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair in detail and to evaluate the clinical outcome as well as cuff repair integrity with this new method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 116 patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears underwent arthroscopic surface-holding repair and were monitored with the Japanese Orthopaedic Association, Constant-Murley, and University of California-Los Angeles scores to assess the clinical outcome. The mean follow-up period was 17.9 months (range, 12-40 months). Cuff repair integrity was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: All 3 rating systems at the time of final follow-up reflected a significant improvement in functional recovery of the shoulder compared with the preoperative scores. The overall rate of rotator cuff retear was 19.0% (22 of 116 shoulders), and the rates were 13.6% (9 of 66 shoulders) for small and medium-sized tears and 26% (13 of 50 shoulders) for large and massive tears. The rate for large and massive tears was much higher in patients older than 70 years (58.3%) compared with those younger than 70 years (36.3%), whereas the retear rates were similar in these 2 groups (22.2% and 17.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic surface-holding repair technique with medial suture and transosseous fixation improved rotator cuff healing. This method may be useful both for young patients and for elderly patients, who frequently have chronic large and massive tears, including osteoporotic bones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bone marrow stimulation (BMS) at the footprint of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has not been fully evaluated according to the preoperative tear size and surgical technique. In this study, we investigated the effect of BMS on cuff repair integrity after an arthroscopic surface-holding (ASH) repair. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 111 patients (mean age, 64.5 years) with chronic rotator cuff tears who underwent treatment by the ASH method with BMS by drilling of multiple holes at the footprint (67 shoulders) or without BMS (44 shoulders) were studied, and all patients were observed prospectively. Sugaya's classification was used to evaluate cuff integrity by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, with types IV and V classified as rotator cuff retears. RESULTS: The mean scores for cuff integrity were 2.2 +/- 0.2 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 in the non-BMS and BMS groups, respectively. The mean scores were similar between the 2 groups for medium tears; however, scores for large-massive tears were significantly lower in the BMS group. The overall retear rate was 23.9% in the non-BMS group and 9.1% in the BMS group, and the distribution of repair types differed significantly. For large-massive tears, the retear rate was much higher in the non-BMS group (28.6%) than in the BMS group (4.5%), although the rates for medium tears were comparable between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that applying BMS to the footprint during ASH repair results in improved cuff repair integrity, particularly in large-massive tears, and suggest the importance of biologic treatment for rotator cuff healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

AB  - In recent years arthroscopic techniques for rotator cuff repair have been successfully developed with technically advanced implants and biomechanically matured suture configurations. Suture anchors have been established as the standard treatment. We describe a special technique for arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair using a hollow needle with simultaneous perforation of tendon and bone. Isolated articular-sided partial or full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon without advanced tendon retraction represent ideal indications. In a prospective cohort study 41 patients with arthroscopic transosseous repair of full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tears were followed up clinically and radiologically using indirect MR arthrography after an average of 45 months. The Constant score improved from 53 to 84 points. In 5 cases a re-rupture was present at follow-up with only 1 patient complaining of poor shoulder function. The arthroscopic transosseous rotator cuff repair represents a reliable alternative to the established techniques using suture anchors or knotless implants with comparable clinical and radiological results. The biological and economical advantages exceed the flat learning curve. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between retear after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair and passive range of motion of the shoulder. Methods: Passive range of motion before and after surgery was compared between the two groups. Results: The healed and retear groups comprised 86.4% and 13.6% shoulders, respectively. Passive external rotation with the arm at the side at 3 months postoperatively was significantly smaller in the healed group than retear group. Conclusions: This difference seemed to be associated with stiffness in external rotation of the shoulder and the process of cuff healing after surgery. Level of evidence: Level III, Case-Control Study, Treatment Study.

AB  - We evaluated the results of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Thirty cases of rotator cuff tear were treated by arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at the Thong Nhat hospital from 1/3/2012 to 30/6/2016. All patients were over 18 years old, had positive rotator cuff tear tests, and underwent X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. The arthroscopic images showed rotator cuff tears, with indication for repair. The functional status of each patient was evaluated using the Constant-Murley Scale and the criteria of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During postoperative rehabilitation, we applied Cohen's protocol. Seventeen patients were female and 13 were male. The median age was 54 years (21-83). Sixteen patients had partial thickness tears and 14 patients had full-thickness tears. Repair technique: Single-row in 13 patients, suture-bridge in 15 patients, transosseous-equivalent in two patients. Four patients with SLAP lesions were treated by debridement labrum for type I, and labral repair for more serious lesions. Five patients with long head biceps tendon rupture were treated with tenodesis. After surgery, 100% of patients were subjected to fluid extravasation through the shoulder joint, but did not have any compartment syndrome; all incisions healed good without infection or neurapraxia. The mean UCLA score was 32.4 (14 patients had excellent results, 14 good, and two fair). The mean Constant score was 38.5; the mean postoperative Constant score was 88.77 (p = 0.001). Among the patients, 90% achieved 80% function compared to a normal shoulder. All patients gave their consent to the study and were prepared for the full course of treatment and arthroscopic surgery. Repair of the rotator cuff was for some participants the only effective treatment and a way to restore the shoulder. Postoperative reconstruction of the rotator cuff of the shoulder resulted in a significant improvement in the indicators of the functional state of the shoulder joint. Copyright © FUNPEC-RP.

AB  - PURPOSE: The postoperative protocol after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) is still controversial. Some surgeons recommend slower rehabilitation in order to improve the integrity of the repair, while others prefer early range-of-motion (ROM) exercise to avoid postoperative stiffness. The purpose of this study was to determine target ROM (T-ROM) measurements at 3 months after ARCR that are predictive of eventual full recovery without structural failure. METHODS: The cases consisted of 374 shoulders in 360 patients who underwent primary ARCR and were followed up for at least 2 years. Forward flexion (FF) and side-lying external rotation (ER) were measured preoperatively at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after surgery, and the patients were divided into six subgroups according to the values for each type of ROM at 3 months (ROM-3M). In each subgroup, the final ROM at 24 months after surgery was compared to determine the T-ROM. The average ROMs with time and re-tear rate were then compared between the under-T-ROM and over-T-ROM groups. RESULTS: The only significant difference in FF was between the 120-129degree and 110-119degree ROM-3M groups. Therefore, the T-ROM for FF was determined to be 120degree. Similarly, the T-ROM for ER was determined to be 20degree. Each ROM in the over-T-ROM group was significantly better than that in the under-T-ROM group at all assessments. There was no significant difference in the re-tear rate between the groups. CONCLUSION: To acquire sufficient ROM in 2 years without high re-tear rate, a target FF of 120degree and ER of 20degree should be achieved within 3 months after surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The arthroscopic double-row transosseous-equivalent (TOE) rotator cuff repair is growing in popularity. The current body of literature supports this technique; however, the number of patients in these studies is relatively small. The authors conducted this study to learn more about the natural history of this construct in a large sample of patients. HYPOTHESIS: The double-row TOE rotator cuff repair will have an acceptable structural failure rate with improved clinical outcomes at 1-year follow-up. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Between June 2006 and October 2007, 225 patients underwent an all-arthroscopic rotator cuff repair at 2 surgical centers. A total of 155 TOE primary rotator cuff repairs were performed, and 154 of these patients met the inclusion criteria. Assessment of structural integrity was based on evaluation of postoperative magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography arthrogram at a minimum of 12 months after surgery. The Constant scores, visual analog pain scale, range of motion, strength, and complications were the clinical outcomes analyzed for the study. Seventeen patients (of 154) had postoperative shoulder stiffness at follow-up. RESULTS: The 154 patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated at a mean of 15 months postoperatively (range, 12-26.1 months). The study included 47 small (30.5%), 89 large (57.1%), and 19 massive (12.3%) rotator cuff tears. Analysis of postoperative imaging demonstrated that 92%, 83%, and 84% of the small, large, and massive rotator cuff tears, respectively, were intact. The mean Constant score improved from 44.42 points preoperatively to 80.47 points postoperatively (P < .001). The mean preoperative pain score improved from 3.83 to 12.77 (P < .001) postoperatively. The mean forward flexion improved from 123.06degree preoperatively to 162.39degree postoperatively (P < .001). Seventeen patients (of 154) had postoperative shoulder stiffness at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The short-term results of this study indicate that the clinical outcomes and structural integrity of TOE double-row rotator cuff repair (the suture-bridge technique) have results that compare favorably with those reported for other double-row suture anchor techniques employed in rotator cuff repairs. Long-term follow-up will be necessary to determine if the durability of these repairs and the structural integrity of these constructs maintain their performance over time.

AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine whether the timing of preoperative shoulder injections is associated with an increased risk of revision rotator cuff repair following primary rotator cuff repair (RCR). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of claims data of privately insured subjects from the MarketScan database for the years 2010 to 2014 was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare the odds of reoperation between groups. Laterality for the injection, index procedure, and subsequent surgery were verified for all subjects. RESULTS: A total of 4,959 subjects with an arthroscopic RCR were identified, 392 of whom required revision RCR within the following 3 years. Patients who had an injection within 6 months preceding the index surgery were at a much higher risk of undergoing reoperation for revision RCR: 0 to 3 months prior, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.375 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.027-1.840); 3 to 6 months prior, AOR 1.822 (95% CI, 1.290-2.573); and 6 to 12 months prior, AOR 1.237 (95% CI, 0.787-1.943). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had received an injection within 6 months prior to RCR were much more likely to undergo a revision cuff repair within the following 3 years. The risk of reoperation significantly declines if there is more than 6 months between injection and RCR. Consideration should be given to minimizing preoperative injections in patients requiring RCR or delaying primary RCR for 6 months following injection. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of the modified frailty index-5 (mFI-5) as a predictor for postoperative complications in patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients undergoing arthroscopic RCR between 2006 and 2016. The mFI-5, a 5-factor score comprising comorbid diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and functional status limiting independence, was calculated for each patient. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the mFI-5 score as a predictor for complications including medical complications, surgical-site infections, hospital admission, discharge to a facility, and mortality. RESULTS: In total, 24,477 patients met criteria for inclusion. The mFI-5 was a strong predictor for medical complications (P < .001), hospital admission (P < .001), length of stay (P = .007), and discharge to a facility (P = .001) but not surgical-site infections (P = .153). For each point increase in mFI-5 score, the risk for a medical complication increased by 66%, readmission by 52%, and adverse discharge by 45%. However, of all the measured complications, the mFI-5 was the strongest predictor for mortality, with the risk more than doubling for each increase in mFI-5 point (odds ratio 2.66, P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: The mFI-5 is a sensitive tool for predicting life-threatening medical complications, hospital admission, increased length of stay, adverse discharge, and mortality following arthroscopic RCR. The 5 comorbidities comprising the mFI-5 are easily obtained through the patient history, making it a practical clinical tool for identifying high-risk patients, informing preoperative counseling, and improving value-based health care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, prognostic.

AB  - Postoperative tendon healing is still a matter of concern after rotator cuff repair. Several techniques have been introduced to help improve this healing process. Among them, the bone marrow is commonly used source and a research subject for methods using stem cells to promote wound healing process. A number of studies have shown that bone marrow stem cells can travel up through the holes on the rotator cuff insertion sites, contributing into the rotator cuff repair process, increasing the efficiency of tendon healing and improving clinical results. Patients and Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on 41 rotator cuff tear patients. The microfractures for these patients were calculated beforehand, which have great depth but small diameter, based on the anatomical characteristic of the rotator cuff tear insertions of Vietnamese people. Patients' rotator cuff tendon healing processes were evaluated using ultrasound after surgery. Final tendon healing and clinical results ultimately rely on MRI assessments, classified according to Sugaya's classification, UCLA and ASES scale. Result(s): No cases of rupture and fracture of the greater tubercle was recorded. There was a clear progression of tendon healing on ultrasound according to postoperative follow-up time-stamps (1 month, 3 months). MRI images evaluation also reveals at the latest follow-up time, according to Sugaya classification, the ratio of tendon healing was 87.8%, while the percentage of re-rupture was 12.2%. ASES and average UCLA scale were collected at the end of the study, respectively as 95.41 +/- 5.45 and 32.36 +/- 2.53. Conclusion(s): The technique's microfractures characteristics based on the rotator cuff tear insertion anatomy ensures a secure, straightforward approach along with promising results in terms of tendon healing rate and postoperative functional outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has become popular in the last few years because it avoids large skin incisions and deltoid detachment and dysfunction. Earlier arthroscopic single-row (SR) repair methods achieved only partial restoration of the original footprint of the tendons of the rotator cuff, while double-row (DR) repair methods presented many biomechanical advantages and higher rates of tendon-to-bone healing. However, DR repair failed to demonstrate better clinical results than SR repair in clinical trials. MR imaging at 3 Tesla, especially with intra-articular contrast medium (MRA), showed a better diagnostic performance than 1.5 Tesla in the musculoskeletal setting. The objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the clinical and 3 Tesla MRA results in two groups of patients operated on for a medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tear with two different techniques. METHODS: The first group consisted of 20 patients operated on with the SR technique; the second group consisted of 20 patients operated on with the DR technique. All patients were evaluated at a minimum of 3 years after surgery. The primary end point was the re-tear rate at 3 Tesla MRA. The secondary end points were the Constant-Murley Scale (CMS), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) scores, surgical time and implant expense. RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 40 months in the SR group and 38.9 months in the DR group. The mean postoperative CMS was 70 in the SR group and 68 in the DR group. The mean SST score was 9.4 in the SR group and 10.1 in the DR group. The re-tear rate was 60% in the SR group and 25% in the DR group. Leakage of the contrast medium was observed in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on 3 Tesla MRA in the evaluation of two different techniques of rotator cuff repair. DR repair resulted in a statistically significant lower re-tear rate, with longer surgical time and higher implant expense, despite no difference in clinical outcomes. We think that leakage of the contrast medium is due to an incomplete tendon-to-bone sealing, which is not a re-tear. This phenomenon could have important medicolegal implications. Level of evidence III. Treatment study: Case-control study.

AB  - Background: Despite current published reports, a thorough understanding of the natural history of non-operatively treated full thickness tears remains limited. The rate and risk of tear progression, increasing fatty infiltration, muscle atrophy, and other factors of symptomatology are not completely understood. Case Description: We present a 10-year course of non-surgically treated full thickness supraspinatus tear in a relatively young patient. Initial operative treatment was recommended, but the patient refused and pursued physical therapy and continuation of an active lifestyle. Over the decade in which the patient remained asymptomatic he had minimal progression of cuff pathology as shown by MRI. Literature Review: While several studies have been published discussing outcomes of non-operatively managed full thickness rotator cuff tears, there are no reports involving this demographic over such an extended period of time [4,14,15,26,27]. Current studies following the conservative courses of full thickness tears range from averages of 1.9 to 5 years in length of follow-up and mean age ranges from 52 to 64 years [4,14,15,26,27]. Due to concerns with the advancement of pathology with worsening long-term outcomes, surgical intervention is typically recommended for relatively young patients with symptomatic full thickness tears [22]. Clinical Relevance: With this case, we seek to portray a scenario in which the algorithmic thinking of operative treatment as the standard in young patients may be studied more extensively. It is also unique in that the continued use of the rotator cuff over an extended period of time did not contribute to a significant progression in tear size. Copyright © 2015.

AB  - PURPOSE AND HYPOTHESIS: This study evaluates the functional and cosmetic results following fixation of the long head of the biceps (LHB) tendon at the antero-medial footprint anchor of a rotator cuff reconstruction, using the "lasso-loop" technique. METHODS: 39 patients with a mean age of 62 years with a rotator cuff tear and associated lesion of the LHB tendon were included in this study. Besides rotator cuff repair in an arthroscopic anchor technique, all patients received additional LHB tenodeses using the lasso-loop technique. Clinical follow-up consisted of the Constant score (CS), LHB score, DASH score, and WORC index. Relevant sub-items, such as elbow flexion strength and cosmesis, were compared to the contralateral arm. RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 22 months (11-39 months), the CS resulted in an average of 81 points. The biceps-specific LHB score showed a mean value of 89 points. The analysis of the DASH score showed an average of 16.9 points and the analysis of the WORC index showed an average result of 79.7 %. Distalization of the biceps muscle was objectively in three cases (7.7 %) (as observed by the examiner) and subjectively in one of those cases (as noted by the patient). There was a loss in elbow flexion strength compared to the contralateral side; however, this loss was not statistically significant and not associated with clinical apparent re-tear or insufficiency of the tenodesis. DISCUSSION: The arthroscopic lasso-loop tenodesis of the LHB tendon is a time and cost-efficient technique. No additional anchor is needed when included in the rotator cuff repair. Functional and cosmetical results as well as results from the biceps-specific LHB score were good to excellent. The loss in elbow flexion strength is most likely associated with concomitant rotator cuff lesion. CONCLUSION: The lasso-loop fixation technique of the LHB tendon using the antero-medial footprint anchor in rotator cuff tears is a reliable and cost-efficient procedure. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk factors for the development of re-tear following Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair (aRCR). METHODS: This retrospective clinical study included 196 consecutive aRCRs with a minimum 3-year follow-up. Pre- and postoperative clinical and functional outcomes were measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), the University of California at Los Angeles Shoulder Rating Scale (UCLA), the Constant-Murley Score (CMS), and the Douleur Neuropathique (DN4) questzionnaire. The Goutallier staging of fatty infiltration, Occupational Ratio (OR), the Acromiohumeral Interval (AHI), Acromioclavicular Joint (ACJ) arthritis, acromion type, Critical Shoulder Angle (CSA), and tangent sign (tan- sign) were evaluated as radiological parameters. Different subgroup parameters were evaluated after dividing the patients into re-tear (-) and re-tear (+) groups, according to clinical and radiological outcomes as well as patient and intraoperative characteristics. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 72.0 +/- 15.8 months. The mean age at the time of surgery was 58.4 +/- 8.9 years. A significant improvement was found in clinical and functional scores in the re-tear (-) group (P < 0.001 for all). However, the retear (+) group had poorer outcome scores than the re-tear (-) group. Twenty patients (10.2%) had re-tear at the last follow-up. There was a significant difference between groups regarding pre-and postoperative clinical scores, with worse scores in the retear (+) group (P < 0.001 for all). Also, pre-and postoperative pseudoparalysis (P = 0.001 for both), acromioclavicular joint arthritis (ACJ) (P = 0.001), intraoperative rotator cuff wear (P = 0.007) or stiffness (P = 0.025), a longer time period between symptom onset and surgery (P = 0.031), larger tear size (P = 0.010), preoperative shoulder stiffness (P = 0.001), higher duration of postoperative analgesia use (P < 0.001), higher degrees of preoperative Occupational Ratio (OR) (P < 0.001), and higher degrees of fatty degeneration (P < 0.001) were found to be associated with re- tear development. CONCLUSION: Surgeons should consider the preoperative degree of fatty degeneration, clinical and functional scores, presence of ACJ arthritis, intraoperative tendon quality, tear size and chronicity as well as postoperative prolong analgesic requirement, and development of pseudoparalysis as factors regarding re-tear development risk following aRCR. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, Therapeutic Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated the feasibility and safety of all-suture anchors in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. METHODS: All patients were diagnosed with a rotator cuff tear by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with partial tears, massive tears, subscapularis tears, or previous shoulder surgery, were excluded. MRI and clinical outcome were investigated in all patients at 1.58 years (range, 1.0-2.0 years) after rotator cuff repair with all-suture anchors (prospective case series). Integrity of the cuff repair, cyst formation (encapsulated fluid signal around the anchor), ingrowth of the bone into the anchor, and integrity of the bone tunnel border were evaluated for 47 anchors. Clinical results were evaluated using the Constant-Murley score. RESULTS: An MRI evaluation was performed in 20 patients at 1.58 years (range, 1.0-2.0 years) after rotator cuff repair with all-suture anchors. MRI evaluation showed a very small rim of fluid around 10% of the anchors. None of the anchors showed cyst formation with fluid diameter more than twice the anchor diameter. In approximately 90% of the anchors, no fluid could be detected between the anchors and the edge of the bony tunnel. Full rotator cuff integrity was seen in 19 patients. Only 1 patient sustained a retear. Clinical results comparable with an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using classic anchors were seen. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective clinical cohort study shows promising early radiographic and clinical results after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair using all-suture anchors.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of all-arthroscopic repair of degenerative subscapularis tendon tears and post-operative structural integrity using magnetic resonance imaging with a short-term follow-up. METHODS: Twenty-one patients were treated all-arthroscopically for a full-thickness degenerative subscapularis tendon tear. Median patient age was 55 years (range, 41-69). Median follow-up was 25 months (range, 15-44). Patients were evaluated prior to surgery and at follow-up: active range of motion, VAS pain, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score (DASH). At final follow-up, the Constant-Murley score was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean active range of motion showed significant post-operative improvement (p < 0.001). VAS pain improved from 8.3 (SD +/- 1.3) pre-operatively to 2.7 (SD +/- 1.8) post-operatively (<0.001); SST increased from 20 % (SD +/- 26) pre-operatively to 83 % (SD +/- 27) post-operatively (<0.001); DASH scores improved 67 (SD +/- 19) to 18 (SD +/- 21) post-operatively (<0.001). Post-operative Constant-Murley score was 79 (SD +/- 12). Two patients had failure of the repair on post-operative MRI. Twelve cases (57 %) showed post-operative progression of fatty muscle infiltration. CONCLUSION: All-arthroscopic repair is an effective treatment modality for degenerative subscapularis tendon tears with an anterosuperior tear pattern with good clinical results and high patient satisfaction. Although there was a high tendon-to-bone healing rate, fatty muscle infiltration was progressive in more than half of the patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic case series, Level IV.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the reoperations, complications, and costs up to 5 years following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) alone, with acromioplasty (acro), with biceps tenodesis (BT), or with both acro and BT. Methods: We queried the MarketScan database to identify patients who underwent RCR from 2007 to 2016. Patients were stratified into groups based on concomitant procedures (acro and/or BT) performed on the same day as index RCR. Reoperations, complications, and costs were followed for 5 years post-index procedure. Patients without laterality codes were excluded. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to control for confounding factors. Results: This study identified 147,838 patients (mean age, 53.1 years; standard deviation, 8.3 years) who underwent primary RCR. Patients were stratified into 4 groups: (1) RCR only, (2) RCR + acro, (3) RCR + BT, and (4) RCR + acro + BT. Patients in the RCR only group experienced the highest rate of unadjusted overall postoperative complications (17.2%) versus the other groups (RCR + acro 16.4%, RCR + BT 15.1%, RCR + acro + BT 16.2%, P < .0161). The RCR only group also experienced a significantly greater number of reoperations on the ipsilateral shoulder (P < .0001), whereas the RCR + acro + BT had the highest costs at all timepoints. In the regression analysis, there was no significant differences between complications and reoperations between any groups. After adjusting for covariates, the performance of a BT with an RCR and acromioplasty led to increased costs (odds ratio, 1.47, 1.37-1.59, P < .001). Conclusions: Concomitant biceps tenodesis does lead to higher total healthcare costs, both in the shorter and longer terms. When adjusting for confounding factors, the performance of concomitant biceps tenodesis with rotator cuff repair does not lead to a difference in postoperative complication rate or risk for revision surgery. Level of Evidence: <b>Level IV,</b> economic analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recurrent or persistent defects in the rotator cuff after its repair are common. Short- and medium-term surveys have revealed, after open repair, patients with an intact rotator cuff have increased function and ROM. However, no long-term studies have verified cuff integrity on MR arthrography or correlated it with clinical and functional outcomes. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We evaluated long-term cuff integrity and fatty infiltration after open repair using MR arthrography and determined whether these findings correlated with clinical and functional results. METHODS: Using MR arthrography, we retrospectively evaluated 67 patients (48 men, 19 women) who underwent open rotator cuff repair between 1980 and 1989. Their mean age at surgery was 52 years. Minimum followup was 16 years (mean, 20 years; range, 16-25 years). RESULTS: The retear rate was 94%, and mean size of rerupture was 3.5 x 3.6 cm (ranges, 0.5-5.0 cm x 0.5-5.2 cm; median, 4 x 4 cm). The remaining four patients had a partial supraspinatus tendon tear. Fatty infiltration was marked in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons. Cuff integrity correlated with clinical results: active external rotation and forward flexion, and flexion, abduction, and external rotation strengths, were better in patients with an intact rotator cuff or a small retear of 4 cm(2) or less than in patients with larger tears. Cuff integrity also correlated with functional results. CONCLUSIONS: Rotator cuff integrity was lost in 94% of patients after a minimum followup of 16 years. Cuff integrity correlates well with clinical and functional results even several years postoperatively. A large retear seems to be the most important factor in deteriorating long-term clinical and functional results after open rotator cuff repair. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Stiffness after a rotator cuff tear is common. So is stiffness after an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. In the literature, however, postoperative restriction of passive range of motion after open rotator cuff repair in shoulders with free passive range of motion at surgery has seldom been recognized. We hypothesize that this postoperative stiffness is more frequent than recognized and slows the primary postoperative healing after a rotator cuff reconstruction. We wondered how common is postoperative restriction of both active and passive range of motion after open rotator cuff repair in shoulders with free passive preoperative range of motion, how it recovers, and whether this condition influences short- and long-term results of surgery. We also explored factors predicting postoperative shoulder stiffness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 103 postoperative stiff shoulders among 416 consecutive open rotator cuff repairs, evaluating incidence and duration of stiffness, short-term clinical results and long-term range of motion, pain relief, shoulder strength, and functional results 3-20 (mean 8.7) years after surgery in 56 patients. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative shoulder stiffness was 20%. It delayed primary postoperative healing by 3-6 months and resolved during a mean 6.3 months postoperatively. External rotation resolved first, corresponding to that of the controls at 3 months; flexion and abduction took less than 1 year after surgery. The mean summarized range of motion (flexion + abduction + external rotation) increased as high as 93% of the controls' range of motion by 6 months and 100% by 1 year. Flexion, abduction, and internal rotation improved to the level of the contralateral shoulders as did pain, strength, and function. Age at surgery and condition of the biceps tendon were related to postoperative stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative stiff shoulder after open rotator cuff repair is a common complication resolving in 6-12 months with good long-term results.

AB  - Background: Biceps tendon pathology is commonly associated with rotator cuff tears. A multitude of different biceps tenodesis techniques have been studied, with limited clinical data on arthroscopic biceps tenodesis techniques incorporated into rotator cuff repairs. Purpose: To evaluate the outcomes of an arthroscopic biceps tenodesis incorporated into a supraspinatus tendon repair. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients undergoing surgical treatment of supraspinatus tendon tears with concomitant biceps tendon pathology were prospectively enrolled from 2014 to 2015. A total of 32 patients underwent combined biceps tenodesis and rotator cuff repair; of these, 19 patients were evaluated for a mean of 2.0 years. The primary outcome measures were the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES; patient self-report and physician assessment sections), visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, responses to specific biceps-related assessments, and biceps specific physical exam findings. Results: Patient-reported ASES scores improved from 45.9 preoperatively to 91.6 at the 2-year follow-up (P < .001). Pain VAS scores improved from 5.2 preoperatively to 0.7 at the 2-year follow-up (P < .001). Preoperatively, 18 patients had a positive Speed test; all were negative at 5 months postoperatively, and 21 patients had bicipital groove tenderness preoperatively, which resolved in all 21 patients at 5 months postoperatively. At the 2-year follow-up, 2 patients had cramping arm pain and 4 patients noticed a change in arm contour. There were no reoperations. No complications occurred in the study group. Conclusion: Arthroscopic biceps tenodesis incorporated into a supraspinatus tendon repair was a safe and reliable option for biceps pathology with a concomitant rotator cuff tear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The suture-bridging technique is a new arthroscopic technique to repair rotator cuff tears. Biomechanical advantages compared with double-row fixations have been described. HYPOTHESIS: The authors hypothesized that arthroscopic suture-bridging repair of the supraspinatus tendon would result in a superior clinical outcome and lower retear rates compared with previously published results after double-row fixation. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Fifty-one consecutive patients, with a median age of 62 years (range, 37-76 years), who had undergone an arthroscopic suture-bridging repair of an isolated supraspinatus tendon tear were evaluated in this prospective study 4, 12, and a median of 24 months postoperatively. Subjective and functional outcome was assessed using the simple shoulder test and Constant score. With magnetic resonance imaging 12 months postoperatively, the tendon integrity and potential predictors of failures were evaluated. RESULTS: The simple shoulder test scores improved significantly from 9 points (range, 1-12 points) at 4 months, to 12 points (range, 1-12 points) at 12 months, and 12 points (range, 5-12 points) at 24 months postoperatively. The Constant score increased significantly from preoperative 64% (range, 37%-92%) to 82% (range, 36%-100%) at 4 months, 96% (range, 49%-100%) at 12 months, and 96% (range, 64%-100%) at 24 months postoperatively. Magnetic resonance imaging 12 months after surgery showed retears in 28.9%. Two different types of retears could be observed: insufficiently healed and medially retorn supraspinatus tendons. The Constant score did not differ significantly between the groups with retears and intact repairs. A patient age of more than 60 years was found to influence tendon healing significantly. CONCLUSION: The hypothesis, that arthroscopic suture-bridging repair of the supraspinatus tendon would result in a superior clinical outcome and lower retear rates compared with previously published results after double-row fixation, could not be confirmed. The functional outcome after the new suture-bridging technique was good and comparable with the reported results after double-row repair from the literature. A structural failure of tendon repair was not identical to clinical failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioabsorbable suture anchors have been associated with bone-derived complications, such as osteolysis and cyst formation, after rotator cuff repair. The purpose of this study was to assess the osseous degradation process of the novel biocomposite suture anchor material polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)/beta-tricalcium phosphate (s-TCP)/calcium sulfate (CS) after arthroscopic single-row rotator cuff repair. The focus of interest was the appearance of osteolysis and the rate of total resorption of the implants after 21 months. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with 82 implanted suture anchors who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair between January 2015 and March 2016 at our institution were retrospectively evaluated by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. The appearance of osteolysis was classified by measurement of the peri-implant fluid. The degree of resorption was measured by grading the persistent visibility of the anchor structures. The integrity of the rotator cuff tendon was analyzed to discover possible retear or anchor pull-out complications. RESULTS: After a follow-up of 21.2 (+/- 5.4) months, osteolysis was detected in only two anchors (2.4%), and none of these defects exceeded the diameter of the former suture anchor (5.5 mm). Fifty percent of the anchors were fully degraded and no longer visible. Furthermore, only two retears of the rotator cuff occurred, and no anchor pull-out complications were detected. CONCLUSION: PGLA/beta-TCP/CS is a fully resorbable and osteoconductive suture anchor material that seems to have superior resorption characteristics compared to those of other bioabsorbable suture anchor materials commonly used in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The presented study was retrospectively registered by the commission for ethics at the Arztekammer Nordrhein with the registration number 2016433 on January 17, 2017. All participating patients gave written consent for participation and the publication of their data. Level of evidence: Iv.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify risk factors for infection after rotator cuff repair. We hypothesized that patient characteristics and surgical technique would affect the rate of infection. METHODS: The records of 1,824 rotator cuff repairs performed by a single surgeon from 1995 to 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. Fourteen patients had an early deep postoperative wound infection that was treated with surgical irrigation and debridement. One hundred eighty-five control patients who were treated with rotator cuff repair and did not develop an infection were selected randomly for comparison and statistical analysis. Data regarding preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for infection were recorded, and a multiple logistic regression was conducted to investigate predictors of infection. RESULTS: The infection rate was 0.77% (14/1,822). On average 2.1 (range 1 to 4) surgical debridements were performed in addition to treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Patients who had open or miniopen rotator cuff repair had a significantly greater risk of acute postoperative infection (odds ratio [OR] = 8.63, P = .002). Seventy-nine percent of the patients in the infection group had an open or miniopen repair, whereas only 28% of the control group had an open or miniopen repair. Male patients also had a significantly greater risk of acute postoperative infection (OR = 9.52, P = .042). A total of 92% of the infection patients were male compared with 58% of the control group. In addition, as body mass index increased there was a reduction in the odds of infection (OR = 0.81, P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case control study demonstrate that open or miniopen surgical technique and male sex are significant risk factors for infection after rotator cuff repair. In our study, arthroscopic rotator cuff repair reduced the risk of infection compared with open techniques. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.

AB  - Both rotator cuff repair (RCR) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) are effective treatment options for chronic large degenerative rotator cuff tear (RCT) in the elderly. The goal of this study was to evaluate national trends for surgical management of chronic RCT among patients without glenohumeral arthritis. The authors conducted a retrospective review from 2007 to 2015 using the PearlDiver database. The study included patients who had the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis of chronic RCT without shoulder arthritis. Procedural codes from the Current Procedural Terminology and the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, were used to identify patients undergoing RCR or RTSA. Chi-square analysis assessed differences between the groups, and Cochran-Armitage trend tests were used to evaluate trends over time. Overall, 428,651 patients had chronic RCT without arthritis; 364,141 (84.9%) were treated nonoperatively, 53,566 (12.5%) underwent RCR, and 10,944 (2.6%) underwent RTSA. Patients who were 60 to 79 years old had the highest rate of surgical intervention (70.8% of all surgical patients), with 69.2% and 78.4% who underwent RCR and RTSA, respectively. A 3-fold increase in RTSA use was noted among patients 60 years and older vs patients younger than 60 years. Overall revision rates 2 years after RCR and RTSA among patients 60 to 79 years old were 13.0% and 3.7%, respectively. Revision rates after RCR remained constant over time (9.3% to 13.0%; P=.082), whereas revision rates after RTSA decreased significantly over time (12.1% to 2.2%; P=.016). Older patients were more likely to be treated nonoperatively compared with younger patients, but among those patients treated with RTSA, there was a 3-fold increase in the use of RTSA in patients older than 60 years compared with patients younger than 60 years. Further, the authors found that revision rates after RTSA decreased over time (from 12% to 2%), suggesting better implant design, improved knowledge of implant positioning, and increased surgical proficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether there is any significant difference in temporal measurements of pain, function and rates of re-tear for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR) patients compared with those patients undergoing open RCR. METHODS: This study compared questionnaire- and clinical examination-based outcomes over two years or longer for two series of patients who met the inclusion criteria: 200 open RCR and 200 arthroscopic RCR patients. All surgery was performed by a single surgeon. RESULTS: Most pain measurements were similar for both groups. However, the arthroscopic RCR group reported less night pain severity at six months, less extreme pain and greater satisfaction with their overall shoulder condition than the open RCR group. The arthroscopic RCR patients also had earlier recovery of strength and range of motion, achieving near maximal recovery by six months post-operatively whereas the open RCR patients took longer to reach the same recovery level. The median operative times were 40 minutes (20 to 90) for arthroscopic RCR and 60 minutes (35 to 120) for open RCR. Arthroscopic RCR had a 29% re-tear rate compared with 52% for the open RCR group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Arthroscopic RCR involved less extreme pain than open RCR, earlier functional recovery, a shorter operative time and better repair integrity.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether shoulder injections prior to rotator cuff repair (RCR) are associated with deleterious surgical outcomes. METHODS: Two large national insurance databases were used to identify a total of 22,156 patients who received ipsilateral shoulder injections prior to RCR. They were age, sex, obesity, smoking status, and comorbidity matched to a control group of patients who underwent RCR without prior injections. The 2 groups were compared regarding RCR revision rates. RESULTS: Patients who received injections prior to RCR were more likely to undergo RCR revision than matched controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.38-1.68; P < .0001). Patients who received injections closer to the time of index RCR were more likely to undergo revision (P < .0001). Patients who received a single injection prior to RCR had a higher likelihood of revision (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.43; P = .001). Patients who received 2 or more injections prior to RCR had a greater than 2-fold odds of revision (combined OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.82-2.47; P < .0001) versus the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This study strongly suggests a correlation between preoperative shoulder injections and revision RCR. There is also a frequency dependence and time dependence to this finding, with more frequent injections and with administration of injections closer to the time of surgery both independently associated with higher revision RCR rates. Presently, on the basis of this retrospective database study, orthopaedic surgeons should exercise due caution regarding shoulder injections in patients whom they are considering to be surgical candidates for RCR. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.

AB  - Background: Smoking is a poor prognostic factor for healing after rotator cuff repair and is associated with inferior results. We hypothesized that smokers would have higher recurrent tear rates and more postoperative myotendinous junction (MTJ) retraction in healed repairs than nonsmokers three months postoperatively. Methods: Rotator cuff repairs (RCRs) were retrospectively reviewed over a 2-year period. Patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 6 months prior to surgery and again at 3 months postoperatively. Seventy-nine patients were included and stratified by smokers versus nonsmokers. Baseline patient demographics, tear characteristics, and surgical factors were collected. Preoperative and postoperative MRIs were assessed to quantify the MTJ position and to establish the recurrent tear rate. Results: For the total cohort (nonsmokers, n = 56; smokers, n = 23), significant differences in age, race, and traumatic onset of injury existed between groups. There were no significant differences in recurrent tear between smokers (26%) and nonsmokers (27%), but nonsmokers were more satisfied. For patients with healed RCRs (nonsmokers, n = 41; smokers, n = 17), there were significant differences in race. On univariate analysis, nonsmokers had a significantly more lateral MTJ postoperatively (P = 0.05). On multivariable regression analysis, medialized postoperative MTJ position in healed cuffs was driven only by greater preoperative rotator cuff retraction preoperatively. There were no significant differences in MTJ position based on smoking status for patients with healed RCRs. Conclusion: Smoking does not appear to be an independent risk factor for postoperative MTJ retraction in healed RCRs, also known as failure in continuity. Preoperative tear size and retraction play the biggest roles in predicting postoperative MTJ position, regardless of smoking status. There are no significant differences in patient-reported outcomes for patients with healed RCRs, but nonsmokers had more satisfaction following RCR in the total cohort. Level of Evidence: Level III; Retrospective cohort study; Diagnostic study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence, causes, and risk factors for unplanned 30-day readmission after shoulder and knee arthroscopy. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective clinic registry, the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, was queried for Current Procedural Terminology codes representing the most common shoulder and knee arthroscopic procedures. Unplanned readmissions within 30 days were evaluated dichotomously, and causes of readmission were identified. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify variables predictive of readmission. RESULTS: In total, we identified 15,167 patients who underwent shoulder and knee arthroscopic procedures in 2012. Overall, 136 (0.90%) were readmitted within 30 days, and the rates were similar after shoulder (0.86%) and knee (0.92%) procedures. Readmissions were most common after arthroscopic debridement of the knee (1.56%) and lowest after rotator cuff and labral repairs (0.68%) and cruciate reconstructions (0.78%). The most common causes of readmission were surgical-site infections (37.1%), deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (17.1%), and postoperative pain (7.1%). Multivariate analysis identified age older than 80 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5 to 8.1), chronic steroid use (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 7.2), and elevated American Society of Anesthesiologists class (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 12.0) as independent risk factors for readmission. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of unplanned readmissions within 30 days of shoulder and knee arthroscopic procedures is low, at 0.92%, with wound-related complications being the most common cause. In patients with advanced age, with chronic steroid use, and with chronic systemic disease, the risk of readmission may be higher. These findings may aid in the informed-consent process, patient optimization, and the quality-reporting risk-adjustment process. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, prognostic study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to ascertain whether patients aged older than 75 years achieve outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair comparable to younger patients. METHODS: Arthroscopic cuff repair was performed in 60 shoulders of 59 patients aged older than 75 years. A control group of 60 younger patients, matched for sex, tear size, and American Society of Anesthesiology Functional Classification grade were included. Surgery occurred from 2006 to 2016. Prospective outcomes were the Constant score (CS), Subjective Shoulder Value, pain, satisfaction, and operative complications. Mean follow-up was 29 months. RESULTS: The elderly group was a mean age of 78 years compared with 59 years for controls. Tear sizes were 25 massive, 20 large, 12 medium, and 3 small. The CS improved by 25.1 points in elderly patients compared with 23.7 points for controls (P = .742). Pain improved by 7.5 of 15 in elderly patients vs. 6.2 of 15 in controls (P = .055). Fifty-five of 59 older patients were satisfied compared with 52 of 60 controls (P = .378). The overall complication rate did not differ between the groups (P = .509). Both groups had 1 infection and 1 stiffness. An acromioclavicular joint cyst developed in 1 younger patient, and a traumatic retear occurred in 1 patient. Subsequent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty was performed in 4 elderly patients at a mean of 28 months after cuff repair. Massive tears had higher risk for subsequent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (P = .026). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients benefit as much from arthroscopic rotator cuff repair as their younger counterparts. Similar improvements in CS, Subjective Shoulder Value, pain, and satisfaction occurred for both elderly and control patients. Arthroscopic repair was safe and effective in both groups. Even elderly patients with massive tears showed clinically significant improvements. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair should be considered as a valuable treatment irrespective of age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff repair has a relatively high (20%-90%) chance of retears. Patients with an intact rotator cuff 6 months after surgery have better subjective and objective outcomes at 6 months and 2 years after rotator cuff repair than those who do not have an intact repair. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if, and if so which, intraoperative factors predict an intact repair 6 months after rotator cuff repair. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: The study consisted of a cohort of 500 consecutive patients who had an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair performed by a single surgeon and an ultrasound evaluation using standard protocols of the repair 6 months after surgery. Exclusion criteria included previous fracture or shoulder surgery, incomplete or partial rotator cuff repair, and concomitant arthroplasty. Rotator cuff tear size was measured intraoperatively and mapped. The quality of the tendon, tendon mobility, and repair quality were assessed and ranked based on predetermined scales (1-4) and recorded on a specifically designed form. Logistic regression analysis was performed, with cuff integrity at 6-month follow-up as the dependent variable and tear/repair factors as the independent variables. RESULTS: The overall postoperative retear rate was 19% at 6 months. The best predictor of rotator cuff integrity was preoperative tear size (correlation coefficient, r = 0.33; P < .001). Patients with small (<=2 cm(2)) rotator cuff tears were least likely to have retears (retear rate, 10%). As the tear size increased, the retear rate increased in a linear fashion: <=2 cm(2) (10%), 2 to 4 cm(2) (16%), 4 to 6 cm(2) (31%), 6 to 8 cm(2) (50%), and >8 cm(2) (57%). Other surgeon-ranked intraoperative assessments did correlate with retears, but the correlations were relatively weak: repair quality (r = -0.17; P < .001), tendon mobility (r = -0.15; P < .001), and tendon quality (r = -0.14; P < .01). Regression analysis showed that the retear rate at 6-month follow-up was best predicted from the preoperative tear size and the surgeon-ranked repair quality: chance of retear = 0.38 + (0.02 x tear size in cm(2)) - (0.08 x repair quality). Tendon quality and tendon mobility did not contribute significantly to this prediction. CONCLUSION: Tear size was the best intraoperative predictor of repair integrity after rotator cuff repair, with tears less than 2 cm(2) twice as likely to heal than tears greater than 6 cm(2).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study is to probe the effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) plus double-row anchor suture bridge (DRASB) under shoulder arthroscopy on the postoperative VAS, SST and Constant scores, rotator cuff tendonbone healing, and re-tear of patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tear (RCT). METHODS: A total of 60 patients with full-thickness RCT treated in our institution from August 2019 to January 2020 were picked and assigned to either group A (n = 30) or group B (n = 30) on a voluntary basis. Group B received DRASB under shoulder arthroscopy, whereas group A underwent DRASB under shoulder arthroscopy plus PRP. We compared the curative effects of both groups. RESULTS: Week 2, 4, 8, 12 after surgery and 6 months after surgery, VAS scores of patients in both groups declined saliently, whereas SST and Constant scores elevated, and the decrease/increase amplitude of patients in group A was sharply higher than that in group B (p < 0.05). At T2 and T3, abduction 90degree external rotation, abduction 90degree internal rotation, abduction and anteflexion in both groups increased strikingly, and group A harbored a brilliantly higher increase than group B (p < 0.05). At T2 and T3, serum NO and IL-6 contents were prominently dwindled in both groups, and group A held a plainly higher decrease than group B (p < 0.05). At T3, in comparison to group B, the rotator cuff tendonbone healing rate and quality of life scores in group A were higher (p < 0.05), whereas retear rate was dramatically lower (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DRASB under shoulder arthroscopy plus PRP therapy can blatantly meliorate the curative effect of patients with full-thickness tear, improve the shoulder joint function and tendonbone healing rate, reduce the postoperative pain degree and the incidence of retear, and can be more broadly promoted and applied clinically.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative ultrashort echo time-T2* (UTE-T2*) mapping shows promise for the detection of potential tendon biochemical conditions, while validation against established clinical studies in the shoulder is needed. PURPOSE: To evaluate and characterize the healing process of the repaired rotator cuff based on longitudinal changes in UTE-T2* values, clinical outcomes, and repair status in patients after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Patients with ARCR (n = 25) underwent quantitative MRI and clinical examinations at serial follow-up time points: 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Age-matched healthy controls (n = 15) were evaluated at 3 and 12 months after enrollment. Clinical scores included the Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, and Fudan University Shoulder score, and visual analog scale for pain. The MRI examination included UTE-T2*mapping. UTE-T2* maps were generated for T2* values at the healing site. Sugaya classification was adopted to evaluate the repair status. Longitudinal analyses of clinical outcomes, UTE-T2* changes, and Sugaya classification were conducted. RESULTS: The overall retear rate was 8% (2/25, all Sugaya type IV). All patients (including the ones with retear) achieved satisfactory outcomes at 12 months that lasted to 24 months on the basis of clinical scores. The mean UTE-T2* values at the healing site showed an increase from 3 to 6 months (P = .03) and then decreased to a level similar to that observed in age-matched healthy tendons at 12 months (P = .1). No significant differences were found between UTE-T2* values at 12 and 24 months (P = .6). UTE-T2* values at the healing site significantly varied with the repair status according to Sugaya classification (P < .05). Moreover, significant correlations were noted between clinical scores and UTE-T2* values at 6 months (r = -0.6 to -0.3; all P < .05) and 12 months (r = -0.6 to -0.2; all P < .05). CONCLUSION: This study indicated a healing-related relationship between clinical outcomes and quantitative UTE-T2* values, which highlights the potential of using UTE-T2* mapping to track the tendon-healing process noninvasively. Moreover, the repaired tendon was comparable to age-matched healthy controls at 12-month follow-up based on UTE-T2* values.

AB  - PURPOSE: The optimal technique for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is still controversial. The aim of this study was to compare modified arthroscopic double-pulley suture-bridge (DPSB) technique with medial knot tying to those without tying, considering clinical and radiological outcomes. METHODS: This study included 292 patients with large full-thickness rotator cuff tears treated with modified DPSB technique. The patients were divided into 158 cases with medial knot tying (knot-tying group) and 134 without tying (knotless group). At follow-up, clinical outcome was assessed by the Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, and Shoulder Rating Scale of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score. The assessment of tendon healing was performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a minimum of 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: The Constant score, ASES score and UCLA score in the knot-tying and knotless groups all improved significantly from before surgery to 12 months postoperatively (P < 0.05, respectively). No significant differences were observed between groups for each phase evaluated (n.s.). Tendon healing was categorised according to Sugaya's classification. The retearing rate was 27/158 (17.0%) in the knot-tying group and 20/134 (14.9%) in the knotless group, with no statistically significant difference between groups (n.s.). Additionally, the retear was classified using the Cho's classification. When comparing the retear rates of different types independently, no statistically significant differences were found between groups (n.s.). CONCLUSIONS: The knotless modified DPSB technique showed comparable short-term functional outcomes to those of the knot tying method in large full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Additionally, no significant differences in repair integrity were observed between the two methods. Both techniques can be considered effective treatments for patients with large-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk factors for tear progression in symptomatic rotator cuff tears have not been clarified yet. It is important for orthopaedic surgeons to know the natural course of tear progression when nonoperative management is to be chosen. HYPOTHESIS: Tears in younger patients, high-activity patients, or heavy laborers would progress in size more than those in older patients, low-activity patients, or light laborers. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with symptomatic rotator cuff tears visited our institute between 2009 and 2015. Of these, 174 shoulders of 171 patients (mean age, 66.9 years) who underwent at least 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were prospectively enrolled. The mean follow-up was 19 months. Tear progression was defined as positive when the tear size increased by >=2 mm. The demographic factors that were analyzed by multivariate analysis included age, sex, hand dominance, smoking, alcohol drinking, hypercholesterolemia, sports participation, job type, tear size, and tear type (full or partial thickness). RESULTS: Of the 174 shoulders, 82 shoulders (47%) showed tear progression. The mean (+/-SD) tear length and width in the progression group on final MRI were 23.1 +/- 12.5 mm and 17.3 +/- 9.6 mm, respectively; the tear size progressed by a mean 5.8 +/- 5.6 mm in length and 3.1 +/- 5.2 mm in width. The mean propagation speed was 3.8 mm/y in length and 2.0 mm/y in width. The size of full-thickness tears significantly increased compared with that of articular-sided partial-thickness tears ( P = .0215). The size of medium tears significantly increased compared with that of other tears ( P < .0001). According to the logistic regression analysis, smoking was significantly correlated with tear progression ( P = .026). Subgroup analyses showed that male sex, hand dominance, and trauma were correlated with tear progression. Age, alcohol drinking, hypercholesterolemia, sports participation, and job type did not show any correlation with tear progression. CONCLUSION: The tear size of symptomatic rotator cuff tears progressed in 47% of the shoulders during a mean of 19 months, and the speed of progression was 3.8 mm/y in length and 2.0 mm/y in width. The risk factors for tear progression were (1) a medium-sized tear, (2) a full-thickness tear, and (3) smoking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rotator cuff repair often results in significant pain postoperatively, the cause of which is undetermined. Purpose /Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between rotator cuff tear area and postoperative pain in patients who had undergone arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. We hypothesized that larger tears would be more painful because of elevated repair tension at 1 week postoperatively but that smaller tears would be more painful because of a greater healing response, especially from 6 weeks postoperatively. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 1624 patients who underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were included in this study. Exclusion criteria were moderate to severe osteoarthritis, isolated subscapularis repair, calcific tendinitis, synthetic patch repair, revision surgery, and retears on ultrasound at 6 months after surgery. Rotator cuff tears were subdivided into groups based on the tear size and retear rate found for each group. A modified L'Insalata questionnaire was given before surgery and at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient tests were performed between rotator cuff tear areas and pain scores. RESULTS: Intraoperative rotator cuff tear areas did not correlate with pain scores preoperatively or at 1 week after surgery. A smaller tear area was associated with more frequent and severe pain with overhead activities, at rest, and during sleep as well as a poorer perceived overall shoulder condition at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after repair ( r = 0.11-0.23, P < .0001). Patients who were younger, had partial-thickness tears, and had occupational injuries experienced more pain postoperatively ( r = 0.10-0.28, P < .0001). Larger tears did not have more pain at 1 week after surgery. The retear rate was 7% in tears <2 cm<sup>2</sup> but reached 44% in tears >8 cm<sup>2</sup>. CONCLUSION: There were fewer retears with smaller tears, but they were more painful than large tears postoperatively from 6 weeks to 6 months after surgery. Smaller tears may heal more vigorously, causing more pain. Patients with smaller tears experienced more pain after rotator cuff repair compared with patients with larger tears. These findings are contrary to previous ideas about tear size and postoperative pain. Healing is likely a determinant of postoperative pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An acute infection after arthroscopic shoulder surgery is a rare but serious complication. Previous studies estimating the incidence of infections after arthroscopic surgery have been conducted, but the majority of these had either relatively small study groups or were not specific to shoulder arthroscopic surgery. PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence of acute infections after arthroscopic shoulder surgery and compare infection rates by age group, sex, geographic region, and specific procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: A retrospective review of a large insurance company database was performed for all shoulder arthroscopic surgeries performed in the United States between 2004 and 2009 that required additional surgery for infections within 30 days. The data were stratified by sex, age group, and region. Data were also stratified for specific procedures (capsulorrhaphy, treatment for superior labrum anterior-posterior tears, claviculectomy, decompression, and rotator cuff repair) and used to assess the variation in the incidence of infections across different arthroscopic shoulder procedures. Linear regression was used to determine the significance of differences in the data from year to year. chi(2) analysis was used to assess the statistical significance of variations among all groups. Poisson regression analysis with exposure was used to determine significant differences in a pairwise comparison between 2 groups. RESULTS: The total number of arthroscopic shoulder surgeries performed was 165,820, and the number of infections requiring additional surgery was 450, resulting in an overall infection rate of 0.27%. The incidence of infections varied significantly across age groups (P < .001); the infection rate was highest in the >=60-year age group (0.36%) and lowest in the 10- to 39-year age group (0.18%). The incidence of infections also varied by region (P < .001); the incidence was highest in the South (0.37%) and lowest in the Midwest (0.11%). The incidence of infection treatments was also significantly different between different arthroscopic procedures (P < .01) and was highest for rotator cuff repair (0.29%) and lowest for capsulorrhaphy (0.16%). The incidence did not significantly vary by year or sex. CONCLUSION: The overall infection rate for all arthroscopic shoulder procedures was 0.27%. The incidence was highest in elderly patients, in the South, and for rotator cuff repair. The incidence was lowest in young patients, in the Midwest, and for capsulorrhaphy. In general, shoulder arthroscopic surgery in this study population had a low rate of reoperation in the acute period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study is to evaluate the clinical results of arthroscopic suture bridge repair for patients with rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Between January 2007 and July 2007, fifty-one shoulders underwent arthroscopic suture bridge repair for full thickness rotator cuff tears. The average age at the time of surgery was 57.1 years old, and the mean follow-up period was 15.4 months. RESULTS: At the last follow-up, the pain at rest improved from 2.2 preoperatively to 0.23 postoperatively and the pain during motion improved from 6.3 preoperatively to 1.8 postoperatively (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The range of active forward flexion improved from 138.4 degrees to 154.6 degrees , and the muscle power improved from 4.9 kg to 6.0 kg (p = 0.04 and 0.019, respectively). The clinical results showed no significant difference according to the preoperative tear size and the extent of fatty degeneration, but imaging study showed a statistical relation between retear and fatty degeneration. The average Constant score improved from 73.2 to 83.79, and the average University of California at Los Angeles score changed from 18.2 to 29.6 with 7 excellent, 41 good and 3 poor results (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The arthroscopic suture bridge repair technique for rotator cuff tears may be an operative method for which a patient can expect to achieve clinical improvement regardless of the preoperative tear size and the extent of fatty degeneration.

AB  - PURPOSE: The study was aimed to compare arthroscopic proximal biceps tenodesis and open subpectoral biceps tenodesis in repair of small or medium rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Eighty-five patients underwent biceps tenodesis with arthroscopic repair of a rotator cuff tear, and 66 patients were followed for median of 26.8 (18-42) months with ultrasonography were reviewed. The arthroscopic biceps tenodesis group included 34 cases, and the open subpectoral biceps group included 32 cases. Patients were evaluated using visual analogue scale (VAS), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and constant scores. Rotator cuff repair and fixation of the biceps tendon were assessed by ultrasonography. Fixation failure and degree of deformity were evaluated by the pain in the bicipital groove and biceps apex distance (BAD). RESULTS: VAS score and tenderness at the bicipital groove decreased significantly in the open subpectoral group at 3 months postoperative. In both groups, the range of motion, ASES score, and constant score increased significantly (P < 0.05). Rotator cuff retear occurred in three cases (8.8 %) in the arthroscopic group and two cases in the open subpectoral group (6.2 %). There was no significant difference in BAD between the two groups. CONCLUSION: There was no difference between open subpectoral tenodesis and arthroscopic proximal tenodesis at the time of the final follow-up; however, open subpectoral tenodesis showed encouraging results at 3-month follow-up. This early result of subpectoral tenodesis was related to removing most part of biceps tendinitis and using intra-bicipital groove tenodesis technique. Level of evidence: Iii.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to determine and compare the effects of early and delayed passive joint rehabilitation protocol on functional and quality of life outcomes in patients following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (RCR). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 202 patients who underwent arthroscopic RCR were included into the study. Ninety eight patients who started the rehabilitation program just after the arthroscopic RCR were comprised as early rehabilitation (ER) group, while 104 patients whose shoulder joint motion was not allowed for 3 weeks after surgery as delayed rehabilitation (DR) group. Demographic characteristics, preoperative and postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, Constant Murley (CM) score, visual analogue scale (VAS), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores were evaluated. Result(s): There was no significant difference between the ER and the DR groups in terms of improvement of ASES, CM, VAS and SF-36 scores after arthroscopic RCR. There was no difference between two groups in terms of complications such as re-tear, frozen shoulder and infection that developed during the follow-up period. Both rehabilitation protocols were found to have a similar effect on patient-reported outcomes. Conclusion(s): At a mean follow-up time of 13 months, early and delayed onset postoperative rehabilitation programs are associated with similar functional and quality of life outcomes, and complication rates. Therefore, DR can be preferred primarily in patients with large tears. ER can be an option for the patients with small tears who has anticipation of early return to work and daily life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although rotator cuff repair is performed to improve health-related quality of life (HRQL) by reducing pain and improving shoulder function, it has not been clearly demonstrated that HRQL is improved in retear cases. PURPOSE: To compare HRQL outcomes after rotator cuff repair between patients with healed cuffs and those with retears using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A total of 81 patients who underwent rotator cuff repair were enrolled in this study. There were 56 patients in the healed group and 25 patients in the retear group. The mean age at the time of surgery was 56 years (range, 35-73 years) in the healed group and 59.7 years (range, 45-74 years) in the retear group. The mean follow-up period was 29.7 months (range, 14-95 months) and 26.4 months (range, 13-101 months) in the healed and retear groups, respectively. RESULTS: At final follow-up, the SF-36 scores for physical and mental component summaries (PCS and MCS, respectively) revealed significant improvement, from 36.6 to 51.2 (PCS) and 34.4 to 51.6 (MCS) in the healed group (P < .0001 in both cases) and from 34.2 to 49.4 (PCS) and 33.4 to 53.2 (MCS) in the retear group (P < .0001 in both cases). Mean scores on the SF-36 subscale for role limitations because of physical health problems (RP) were 52.3 in the healed group and 50.6 in the retear group. The RP and PCS scores were significantly higher in the healed group (P = .007 and P = .025, respectively). All domains and component summaries also had a fair to moderate correlation (range, 0.296-0.496) with the SF-36 score. CONCLUSION: Although clinical shoulder outcome measures (University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA] and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons [ASES] scores) and all dimensions of the SF-36 showed significant improvement in both groups after rotator cuff repair, scores were significantly higher in the healed group on RP and PCS of the SF-36 as well as on the UCLA and ASES. There was no significant difference in MCS scores between the 2 groups. Despite similar improvements in the MCS scores, there were apparent objective differences between the groups. The values were statistically significant but clinically not significant for some of these measures.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes after arthroscopic repair of two different rotator cuff tear configurations: anterosuperior rotator cuff tear and rotator cuff tears with subscapularis involvement. It was hypothesized that, although both tear configurations would show significant improvement in clinical outcomes after arthroscopic repair, the rotator cuff tears with subscapularis involvement where the anterior rotator cable maintains its integrity would have better clinical outcomes and structural integrity. METHODS: This study included 226 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of anterosuperior rotator cuff tears (n = 107, group A) and rotator cuff tears with subscapularis involvement (n = 119, group B). The visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, subjective shoulder value (SSV), American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder score, and active range of motion (ROM) were assessed. Modified belly press test was performed to assess the strength of the subscapularis muscle. Cuff integrity was evaluated using magnetic resonance arthrography or computed tomographic arthrography at 6 months after operation. RESULTS: At 3-year follow-up, the VAS score, SSVs, ASES scores, UCLA shoulder scores, active ROM, and modified belly press test showed significant improvement in both groups (p < 0.001). However, these improvements showed no statistical significance between the two groups. On follow-up radiologic evaluations, no significant difference in re-tear rates between group A (25 of 107, 23.4%) and group B (23 of 119, 19.3%) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anterior cable involvement of the anterosuperior rotator cuff tear did not affect postoperative clinical outcomes and re-tear rate compared to rotator cuff tears with subscapularis involvement where the anterior cable integrity was maintained, although the anterosuperior rotator cuff tear was associated with more significant preoperative supraspinatus fatty infiltration. Therefore, the present study determined that it would not be necessary to differentiate treatment protocols between these patterns. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

AB  - Although it is well known that repairing large or massive tears under tension may have an adverse effect on healing of the repaired tendons, only few studies have addressed this issue in medium-sized isolated supraspinatus full-thickness tear. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes and structural integrity of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with tension versus without it. This study retrospectively investigated 90 patients who underwent arthroscopic repair in a single-row for medium-sized isolated supraspinatus full-thickness tear. The patients were assigned to either repaired under tension (Group A, n = 38) or repaired without tension (Group B, n = 52) groups. Functional outcomes were assessed using the patient reported subjective values and the active range of motion (ROM). Postoperative radiographic evaluation was performed 6 months after the surgery to assess the structural integrity of the repaired tendons. Changes in the subjective shoulder scores from initial to 2 years after surgery showed no statistical significance between the two groups. The ROMs measured at initial and 2 years after surgery also showed no statistical difference between the two groups. Postoperative radiological evaluations found a significantly higher re-tear rate in Group A (28.9%, 11/38) than in Group B (9.6%, 5/52). The torn cuff tendons that were repaired under tension as retraction with limited mobility had significantly higher re-tear rate despite having immobilized for 6 weeks after surgery, but their clinical outcomes showed no significant difference from the outcomes of repaired tendons without tension.

AB  - Background: No study has investigated the treatment outcomes of isolated subscapularis tears with advanced fatty infiltration and tear progression to the supraspinatus tendon. Purpose: To assess the natural progression of isolated subscapularis tears with advanced fatty infiltration and compare clinical outcomes between nonoperative and operative treatment. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This study included 52 patients who received either operative (group A) or nonoperative (group B) treatment at our institution for isolated subscapularis full-thickness tears with grade 3 or 4 advanced fatty infiltration. All study patients had a minimum 2-year follow-up. The following 4 functional measures were used: visual analog scale for pain, Subjective Shoulder Value, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, and University of California Los Angeles score. The modified belly-press test was used to assess subscapularis muscle strength. In group A, structural integrity was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months after surgery. In addition, ultrasonographic evaluation was performed on both groups during the follow-up period to assess tear progression into the supraspinatus tendon. Results: At initial presentation, all functional assessment scores were significantly worse in group A versus group B (P <= .05 for all 4 scores). When we compared the mean change in scores before treatment versus after treatment, the group A patients were found to have significantly greater improvement than group B patients (P < .001 for all 4 scores); however, no significant difference was seen in final outcome scores between the groups. Although a high retear rate of 78.6% (22/28) was identified in group A, both groups showed no further tear progression to the supraspinatus tendon at the final ultrasonographic evaluation. Conclusion: For isolated subscapularis tears with advanced fatty infiltration, clinical improvement was seen with both nonoperative and operative treatment. Although the operatively treated group started with lower baseline scores, there were no significant differences in outcomes at final follow-up. Considering the high retear rate even after repair, surgical treatment of these lesions may not be warranted. Early detection and prompt repair of subscapularis tears, before the lesion becomes advanced with grade 3 or 4 fatty infiltration, are important for better outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The primary objective was to assess whether a patient's early postoperative quality of life (QOL) correlates with the retear rate following single-tendon double-row rotator cuff repair. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of 58 patients who underwent single-tendon arthroscopic rotator cuff repair of full-thickness tears performed by a single surgeon. Patients were randomized to an early- or delayed-motion protocol. At 6 months, all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging to assess whether the rotator cuffs were intact or retorn. QOL was assessed preoperatively and at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively using the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index. RESULTS: After 6 months of rehabilitation, 41 patients (71%) had intact rotator cuff repairs whereas 17 (29%) had full-thickness tears. Patients with torn rotator cuffs at 6 months postoperatively had significantly lower WORC scores at 6 weeks postoperatively (P = .041). Patients with greater improvements in QOL perioperatively (preoperative WORC score minus 6-week postoperative WORC score > 264.5) were more likely to have full-thickness tears by 6 months postoperatively. Compliant patients assigned to the delayed-motion protocol had a failure rate of 11% (2 of 19) compared with 38% (15 of 39) in the noncompliant and early-motion protocol patients (P < .01). Overall, patients who were noncompliant with the shoulder immobilizer were 8.2 times more likely to have a failed repair on magnetic resonance imaging (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with better QOL shortly after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair were more likely to have retears by 6 months.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose was to investigate whether surgical repair earlier or later than 3 months after injury may result in similar outcomes and patient satisfaction. METHODS: Seventy-three patients (75 shoulders, 58 males, mean age 59) who had undergone surgical intervention for traumatic rotator cuff tears from 1999 to 2011 were assessed by MRI, clinical examination and Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) as a primary outcome measure and Oxford Shoulder score (OSS), Constant-Murley score (CS) and EQ-5D as secondary. The patients treated less than 3 months after injury (n = 39) were compared with patients treated more than 3 months after injury (n = 36). The average follow-up time was 56 months (range 14-149), and the average time from injury to repair for all patients was 16 weeks (range 3-104). A single senior radiologist performed a blinded evaluation of all the MRIs. Rotator cuff integrity, presence of arthritis, fatty degeneration and muscle atrophy were evaluated. RESULTS: No differences were found for any of the assessed outcomes (WORC, OSS, CS and EQ-5D) between the two groups. The mean WORC % was 77 % for both groups. Re-tear frequency was 24 %, nine in both groups. Patients with re-tear reported less satisfaction with their outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The surgical treatment of symptomatic traumatic rotator cuff tears repairable later than 3 months after injury yields a good functional outcome, a high level of subjective patient satisfaction, and at the same level for patients receiving earlier treatment. Based on our findings, surgical repair could be encouraged whenever technically possible. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Retrospective Comparative Study, Level III.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) in patients with preoperative stiffness to those without. METHODS: A total of 135 patients were prospectively evaluated for 2 years after ARCR for small to medium sized rotator cuff tears at our institution. Patients were divided into stiff (<100degree of passive forward flexion) and non-stiff cohorts. The stiff group underwent manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) before ARCR was performed. Outcomes were measured using visual analog scale (VAS), Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), and Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) recorded at the preoperative, 6- , 12-, and 24-month time points. The results of ARCR between the cohorts were then compared. RESULTS: A total of 123 out of 135 patients (91.1%) completed the follow-up (stiff n = 46, non-stiff n = 77). There were significant improvements in the mean CSS scores at 6 (mean, 59.87; P < .001) and 12 months (mean, 65.88; P = .021) in the stiff group. There were no significant differences detectable in the CSS and OSS scores between the stiff and non-stiff groups at 6, 12, and 24 months. However, the percentage of patients achieving minimal clinically important difference was significantly higher in the stiff group (97.8%) compared with the non-stiff group (75.3%; P = .001). The VAS scores, forward flexion, and strength in both groups were found to be comparable. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed no significant differences in outcomes scores in patients with stiff shoulders who underwent MUA combined with ARCR compared with patients with non-stiff shoulders who underwent ARCR alone. Therefore, early surgical repair should be considered in patients with rotator cuff tears and concomitant shoulder stiffness. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prospective cohort study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively study curative effects of three repair methods for rotator cuff tears under arthroscopy, and to explore relationships between different repair methods and cuff lesions. METHODS: From January 2009 to Jaunary 2014, a total of 353 patients with rotator cuff tears treated with surgical repair under arthroscopy were included in this study. All the patients were divided into three groups according to time of visitiny hospital and it was divided into three periods. The patients on the first period were treated with single row rivet fixation(115 cases), including 51 males and 64 females, with an average age of (57.46+/-9.08) years old. The patients on the second period were treated with double row rivet fixation(163 cases), including 76 males and 87 females, with an average age of (56.93+/-9.92) years old. The patients in the third period were treated with suture bridge fixation(75 cases), including 32 males and 43 females, with an average age of (55.90+/-9.15) years old. There were 29 patients with huge rotator cuff injuries, who were treated with single-row suture. The shoulders were protected by a brace for 6 weeks after operations were permit ted to perform passive movement within 6 weeks, and then perform active shoulder exercise 6 to 10 weeks after operation. Constant-Murley score, UCLA score and VAS score were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up, and the duration ranged from 12 to 62 months, with a mean of 30 months. There was no infection or nerve injury. UCLA score was improved from preoperative 10.71+/-2.45 to postoperative 32.07+/-3.16; Constant-Murley score was improved from preoperative 43.33+/-11.55 to postoperative 78.15+/-12.64; VAS score was improved from preoperative 5.81+/-1.27 to postoperative 0.52+/-0.71. There were no statistical differences among three groups in UCLA score, Constant-Murley score and VAS score. Total 337 cases were satisfied with treatment results and 16 cases were not satisfied with the results. Among the 16 cases, 3 cases had huge rotator cuff surgery, and 13 cases had no joint stiffness before operation. The main complaints that resulted in dissatisfaction were weakness of the postoperative muscles and failure to restore the labour capacity(11 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Rotator cuff repair under arthroscopy has a reliable clinical effect for the patients with rotator cuff tears. Stable and reliable clinical results can be obtained regardless different repair methods or different rotator cuff tears. The following factors such as no stiffness before operation, too early active exercise and preoperative rotator cuff atrophy may be the risk factors for postoperative dissatisfaction of patients.

AB  - Aims Failure of healing is a well-known problem after repair of the rotator cuff. This study aimed to investigate if early repair of trauma-related full-thickness rotator cuff tears (FTRCTs) could prevent this failure. Patients and Methods In this prospective trial, 62 consecutive patients (14 women (23%), 48 men (77%); median age 61 years (interquartile range (IQR) 54 to 65)) with trauma-related FTRCT underwent arthroscopic single-row repair within six weeks of trauma. Tendon integrity was assessed one year after surgery using the Sugaya score on MR images. Patients were followed up with Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) index, EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), and the Constant-Murley score (CS) two years after repair. Results A total of 57 patients (92%) had MR images available at one year; 59 patients (95%) had CS (one year), WORC (two years), and EQ VAS scores (two years). Intact repair was found on MRI in 36 patients (63%); 13 patients (23%) displayed healing failure of at least one repaired tendon and eight patients (14%) displayed total healing failure. Median WORC index and relative CS improved from 30.8 points (IQR 20.1 to 38.6) at baseline to 85.0 points (IQR 60.6 to 95.7) at two years and 26.5 points (IQR 21.2 to 37.4) to 83.2 points (IQR 71.9 to 97.5) at one year, respectively. The relative CS at one year was significantly better among those with intact repairs compared with those with healing failure (91.6 vs 78.1 points; p = 0.031). Conclusion Although early repair of trauma-related FTRCT improved patient relevant outcomes over two years for the entire cohort, only two out of three repaired rotator cuffs displayed intact structural integrity on MRI after one year. Consequently, early repair did not seem to prevent healing failure after trauma-related FTRCT. Copyright ©2019 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.

AB  - The article presents a qualitative study of patient experiences with the health service and their general practitioners. 22 patients with daily pain were interviewed. They represent a strategic sample of patients with chronic low back pain, but without paresis. Their statements were not as critical as those voiced in the public debate. 18 patients had a continuing patient-doctor relationship. They were all satisfied with their doctor. A need for more information and a better understanding of the patient was present in all interviews. Many of the patients stressed the importance of feeling that the doctor honestly understood their problems. In addition to practical help, the patients also wanted the opportunity to talk to the doctor about their difficult life situation, however without actually expecting that much could be done about it. The most important aspect was to be able to talk about their life situation with a competent person. Kindliness and thoughtful consideration from the doctor meant a lot to the patients in what they experienced as a very difficult life situation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a complex biopsychosocial problem with financial implications for society. Most LBP is categorized as nonspecific CLBP (NS-CLBP); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used in the investigation of LBP but has a high false-positive rate for NS-CLBP. PURPOSE: To explore the psychosocial factors associated with diagnosing NS-CLBP by MRI in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Using a qualitative design, 11 patients with CLBP without a clear medical diagnosis who had received an MRI scan were interviewed using a semi-structured technique, and transcripts were analyzed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Four themes of relevance to the psychosocial consequences of using MRI to diagnose CLBP were identified: 1) impact on social participation after MRI diagnosis; 2) psychological impact of MRI diagnosis; 3) conflicting advice; and 4) patient education. Although some patients expressed a sense of relief following the identification of an objective explanation of their symptoms by MRI, a number of negative consequences were also identified. In particular, fear-avoidance behavior and anxiety were apparent. CONCLUSION: The use of MRI scanning in the diagnosis of LBP may lead to psychosocial factors influencing participation in physical and social daily activities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: current treatments for chronic low back pain (LBP) appear to be inadequate and there are growing calls for new approaches. This study explores the paired interviews of shared experiences among chronic LBP patients and their physicians with the ultimate goal of improving doctor-patient communication and clinical outcomes. METHODS: in-depth interviews of a purposeful sample of paired chronic LBP patients and their doctors were conducted, transcribed and analysed using a multistep iterative process. Interview pairs were examined for important themes and major areas of convergence and divergence/mismatch. RESULTS: patients' stories focused on their suffering from severe and disabling LBP while conveying a high level of reliance on their family physicians. Physicians described many challenges in treating this patient population. Patient and doctor stories were convergent regarding the severity/seriousness of illness, the lack of effective treatments and the existence of many barriers to care. Notable areas of mismatch: biomedical/biomechanical versus biopsychosocial (BPS) models of illness, treatment expectations/goals of reducing pain versus improving function and the importance of a definitive diagnosis. DISCUSSION: patient and physician stories revealed shared themes and convergences, as well as significant discordance and mismatch. Family physicians, trained in and adherent to the BPS model, may have great difficulty when matched with biomechanically oriented patients. Re-conceptualizing doctors and LBP patients as a single teachable dyad may be useful. Clinical application of paired interviews of shared experiences may be useful in bridging communication and paradigmatic gaps, reducing mismatch and developing shared treatment plans.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to describe how patients with chronic back pain experience encounters with health care. Persons with chronic back pain are a stigmatized group often treated based on stereotypes, which may lead to misunderstandings and create frustrated patients and healthcare personnel. Few studies have examined the generic aspects of quality of care in this context. DESIGN: A descriptive design with a qualitative approach was used. METHODS: Nine individual interviews were conducted with chronic back pain patients after admission to an orthopaedic hospital ward. Data were analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: The patients' experiences of healthcare encounters can be described by the theme "Struggling to be seen and understood as a person," comprising the categories "Lack of access and trust to care," "A desire to be taken care of and listened to" and "Own strength to handle healthcare situations."

AB  - The current qualitative study sought to obtain an in-depth understanding of how Arab-Americans conceptualize perceived injustice concerning their chronic low back pain (CLBP) by reflecting on the Injustice Experience Questionnaire (IEQ). Twelve Arab-American adults with CLBP were recruited from a metropolitan area in Alabama using a purposive sampling technique. Participants took part in individual, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews reflecting on each statement from the IEQ. Descriptive data analysis was generated for demographic and pain variables. Directed content analysis was conducted to identify themes and sub-themes. 'Blame and unfairness' and 'severity and irreparability of loss,' the 2 established theoretical factors comprising pain-related injustice appraisal were used as predominant themes. Acceptance emerged as an inductive theme with the following sub-themes: positive appraisal and resilience, attempts to reduce pain, religious values and fate, and belief that everything happening for a reason. The influence of religion was noted across all themes. The current pilot findings suggest that Arabic culture, heavily infused with Islamic beliefs, influences how Arab-Americans conceptualize pain-related injustice appraisals. Additional exploration of the cultural appropriateness of the IEQ among individuals of Arab background is needed to further elaborate on the subject of faith and religious belief suggested by the current study. Perspective: Although the study findings largely reflected established injustice literature constructs, several emergent themes regarding pain-related injustice appraisal were influenced by the participants' culture and religious beliefs. These findings may indicate that specific psychotherapeutic approaches that have been proven effective among some groups may not function similarly in other populations.

AB  - Introduction: The high prevalence of chronic back pain is related to biopsychosocial factors. In this respect, pain is understood as a multifactorial phenomenon made unique by the previous ideas of each individual. Thus, the present study aimed Objective: To understand the experience of chronic back pain and the effectiveness of physiotherapeutic approaches to support new care strategies. Methods: In terms of qualitative research, a comprehensive approach was adopted using the theoretical and conceptual framework developed in the fields of anthropology and health. The sample consisted of 13 women residing in the municipality of Várzea Grande, Mato Grosso state (MT), Brazil, over 40 years old, homemakers, diagnosed with chronic back pain, treated at the Univag clinical school and who had completed physiotherapy more than six months previously. Results: Data analysis indicated that more traditional forms of outpatient physiother- apy prompted a significant improvement in chronic back pain. However, because the condition is chronic, all patients relapsed and their pain and dysfunctional conditions returned. Conclusion: Multiple factors influence the experience of chronic back pain and the constant self-management required forms a circular relationship between objective and subjective elements. On the other hand, by disregarding these elements, physiotherapeutic approaches provide predominantly technical and scientific care far removed from the experience of the affected subject. In this respect, the chronic condition requires long-term care, whereby the focus should shift from the pursuit of a cure to the care model. Chronic Pain. Physical Therapy Specialty. Qualitative Research. Introdução: A alta prevalência das dores crônicas em coluna vertebral está relacionada a fatores biopsicossociais. Nesse sentido a dor é compreendida como um fenômeno multifatorial, porém, singularizada pelos conceitos prévios de cada indivíduo. Objetivo: Compreender a experiência da dor crônica em coluna vertebral e a efetividade das abordagens fisioterapêuticas para subsidiar novas estratégias de cuidados. Métodos: No contexto da pesquisa qualitativa adotou-se a abordagem compreensiva através do referencial teórico e conceitual da fenomenologia desenvolvidos pela área da Antropologia e Saúde. A amostra foi composta por 13 mulheres, residentes no Município de Várzea Grande-MT, acima de 40 anos, trabalhadoras do lar, diagnóstico de dor crônica em coluna vertebral, atendidos na clínica escola do Univag e em alta fisioterapêutica há mais de seis meses. Resultados: A análise dos dados demonstrou que nas formas mais tradicionais a fisioterapia ambulatorial propiciou melhora significativa do quadro de dor crônica em coluna vertebral. No entanto, por se tratar de uma condição crônica, a totalidade dos pacientes recidivaram em seus quadros álgicos e disfuncionais. Conclusão: Há múltiplas influências na construção da experiência da dor crônica em coluna vertebral, admitindo uma relação circular entre elementos objetivos e subjetivos no autogerenciamento constante da mesma. Por outro lado, as abordagens fisioterapêuticas, ao desconsiderarem esses elementos, poderá instituir um cuidado predominantemente técnico-científico distante da experiência do sujeito doente. Nesse sentido a condição crônica requer um cuidado longitudinal no tempo, onde o modelo de cura deve dar lugar ao modelo de cuidado.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term low back pain is associated with multiple challenges to a person's identity and social position. Despite efforts to understand the challenges of low back pain, recovery remains a major problem both personally and socially. This indicate a need for a different approach. Although personal stories have been used to extend knowledge of issues that relate to low back pain, they also make it possible to learn about how people understand themselves and their lives. As such, analysis of narratives may provide further insights into people's coping processes and novel insights about how best to support them. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyse personal recovery narratives to gain an insight into how people understand themselves and cope with long-term low back pain 2-4 years after a bio-psycho-social counselling intervention. STUDY DESIGN: Using a Ricoeurian phenomenological-hermeneutic perspective, qualitative in-depth interviews were undertaken and interpreted to explore people's narratives of long-term recovery after an intervention. METHODS: We interviewed 25 informants 2-4 years after participating in a counselling intervention for low back pain where they were advised to exercise regularly; they were part of the intervention group in a randomised clinical trial. The sample included both informants who had benefited from the intervention and some who had not. Analysis was informed by Ricoeur's interpretation theory. FINDINGS: The informants' stories revealed two main narratives regarding themselves and their lives: (1) getting on with life without pain, (2) life with continual pain and variations of the emplotment. The first included Recovering from low back pain and returning to prior lifestyle if possible, Keeping low back pain in check by strict regimes, or Developing strategies when low back pain recurs. The second related to Finding a way to a functioning everyday life with continual pain while narratives of being stuck with low back pain and finding no way out highlight the significance of being able to configure a narrative that can support an understanding of the pain and how to deal with it to have a functioning life. Furthermore, the health professional has a significant role to play in the configuration of narratives. CONCLUSIONS: The challenge for people with low back pain was to find ways of getting on with life, and this included their ability to configure an understandable narrative that opened up for a future, implying new understandings of the self and how life could be lived. When healthcare professionals offered personal and realistic suggestions to the informants' configuration of narratives of life with low back pain, they supported a positive change in the informants' ways of coping with their situation. IMPLICATIONS: Health professionals can play an important role in low back pain sufferers' configuration of meaningful narratives that help in coping with pain and learning about the relationship between pain and everyday life.

AB  - Aim: Chronic low back pain can reduce engagement and participation in all areas of daily life. Previous research has focused on employment and vocational rehabilitation initiatives, with less attention paid to its impact on leisure. This paper examines the difficulties men with chronic low back pain experienced in the maintenance of their leisure activities. It explores the connection between leisure and social networks and the potential barriers to resuming leisure occupations due to chronic low back pain. Method: This ethnographic study examined the experiences of 11 men involved in a vocational rehabilitation programme in New South Wales, Australia. Data were gathered using participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Findings: Chronic low back pain has a critical impact on leisure occupations. It creates two barriers to a client's engagement in former leisure occupations: physical restrictions and financial barriers. Conclusion: The findings build on knowledge of how leisure impacts on social dimensions of health and wellbeing. Occupational therapists can play an important role in enabling people with chronic low back pain to re-engage in leisure. These interventions may reduce the social isolation experienced by individuals due to the loss of leisure activity.

AB  - Back pain affects a large proportion of the population. It can impact on an individual's ability to function and on their quality of life, and can also incur significant economic, NHS and personal costs. The approach to the treatment of back pain has undergone significant changes in the past 10 years. Current guidelines emphasize the importance of maintaining activity and support the role of analgesics in facilitating active rehabilitation. There is evidence that many patients with chronic conditions do not use medication in the way they were prescribed. Fears associated with analgesics may compound this in those experiencing pain. There is limited research into the attitudes and experiences of sufferers of low back pain who have been prescribed analgesics. This qualitative study explored, through interviews, the attitudes to analgesic use of 16 patients referred to a community-based back pain programme. A thematic analysis was conducted and identified five key themes. The findings suggest that patients are generally confused about the value of complying with their analgesic regime as healthcare professionals do not give them sufficient explanation when the prescriptions are issued.

AB  - Purpose: This study explored the experiences of adult farmers living with chronic low back disorders (LBDs) in Saskatchewan. Method: A qualitative phenomenological approach with inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze semi-structured interviews that had been audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview items focused on the perceived cause of LBDs, their impact on social and work life, coping strategies, and health care access and use. Results: A total of 12 face-to-face interviews were conducted with 11 men and 1 woman aged 40–84 years. Two overarching themes emerged: seasonality and isolation. Related sub-themes included pushing through, doing less, barriers to health care, and self-management. Conclusions: Farmers are faced with seasonal demands and geographical constraints, which lead them to push through the pain or do less when experiencing an episode of low back pain. In addition, farmers identified many barriers to accessing health care services that caused them to develop self-management techniques to cope or to go without care. This study provides the groundwork for future research addressing the unique occupational demands of farmers. Knowledge of farmers' experiences with chronic LBDs and their challenges regarding health care access can help inform health care providers and decision makers and contribute to tailored services and management approaches for similar rural and remote regions in other parts of the world. Objectif : explorer les expériences des agriculteurs adultes de la Saskatchewan qui souffrent de douleurs lombaires chroniques. Méthodologie : les chercheurs ont utilisé une approche phénoménologique qualitative associée à une analyse thématique inductive pour dépouiller des entrevues semi-structurées enregistrées puis transcrites textuellement. Les volets de l'entrevue portaient sur les causes perçues des douleurs lombaires, les effets de ces douleurs sur la vie sociale et professionnelle, les stratégies d'adaptation, l'accès aux soins de santé et l'utilisation de ces soins. Résultats : au total, les chercheurs ont effectué 12 entrevues individuelles auprès de 11 hommes et une femme de 40 à 84 ans. Deux thèmes globaux ont émergé : le caractère saisonnier et l'isolement. Les sous-thèmes connexes incluaient le fait de persévérer, le fait d'en faire moins, les obstacles aux soins et l'autogestion des soins. Conclusion : les agriculteurs doivent se soumettre à des exigences saisonnières et des contraintes géographiques, ce qui les incite soit à persévérer soit à en faire moins lorsqu'ils souffrent de douleurs lombaires. Ils ont également énuméré de nombreux obstacles aux services de santé, qui les portent à adopter des techniques d'autogestion pour endurer ou poursuivre sans se faire soigner. L'étude jette les bases de futures recherches sur les exigences professionnelles caractéristiques des agriculteurs. Ce regard sur les expériences des agriculteurs à l'égard des douleurs lombaires chroniques et de leurs difficultés à obtenir des soins peut éclairer les dispensateurs de soins et les décideurs et contribuer à la création de services adaptés et d'approches de prise en charge dans des régions rurales et éloignées semblables d'autres parties du monde.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients' beliefs have an important influence on the clinical management of low back pain and healthcare professionals should be prepared to address these beliefs. There is still a gap in the literature about the influence of patients' perceptions of their clinical diagnosis on the severity of their pain experience and disability. OBJECTIVES: To identify the perceptions of patients with chronic non-specific low back pain regarding the influence of their clinical diagnosis on pain, beliefs, and daily life activities. METHODS: Qualitative study of 70 individuals with chronic non-specific low back pain. A semi structured interview was conducted about patients' beliefs and perceptions regarding the influence of clinical diagnosis on their daily activities and pain intensity. RESULTS: Most participants believed that higher number of different clinical diagnoses for the same individual may be associated with high pain intensity and disability for daily activities and that pain and injury are directly related. Patients beliefs were grouped into four main themes: (1) pain has multifactorial explanation in physical dimension; (2) improvement expectation is extremely low in patients with chronic pain; (3) clinical diagnosis influences pain and disability levels; (4) clinical diagnosis is extremely valued by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients believe that there is a strong relationship between structural changes in the lower back, pain, and daily life activities; thus, providing evidence of a strong influence of the biomedical model on their beliefs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a lifelong condition causing disability and distress. One aim of treatment is to enhance self-management. To date, self-management interventions have had limited effectiveness. A greater understanding of self-management for CLBP has the potential to improve future interventional trials. The purpose of this study was to identify the experience of CLBP self-management for patients attending outpatient physical therapy and assess how the experience of CLBP self-management changes over time. METHODS: This qualitative study used constructivist grounded theory. Patients with CLBP who were attending an outpatient physical therapy department were recruited using convenience sampling. Each participant attended a semistructured interview. These were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data were coded and thematically analyzed by the lead researcher. Recruitment continued until data saturation. Participants reviewed preliminary themes for validation. RESULTS: Six subthemes emerged from nine interviews: (1) self-doubt, (2) coping day to day, (3) independent discovery, (4) developing resilience, (5) health care: opportunity and threat, (6) living with pain differently. Two themes took on greatest significance. Self-doubt appeared most strongly and was prevalent in all experiences. However, living with pain differently appeared in those who had developed a level of pain acceptance. These themes formed a conceptual model, "Fluctuating Uncertainty." CONCLUSION: The experience of CLBP self-management is one of fluctuating self-doubt. Self-doubt is the predominant experience and is characterized by the perception of pain as a threat and low pain self-efficacy. During times of greater clarity, individuals develop strategies that increase pain self-efficacy and reinforce the perception of pain without threat. These are features of learning to live well with pain. IMPACT: CLBP is a lifelong condition requiring self-management. The current study characterizes the self-management strategies used by patients attending physical therapy. The fluctuating nature of these strategies is dependent upon perception of pain and pain self-efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For medical teams, one of the main objectives of rehabilitation for people with chronic low back pain is adherence to physical activity (PA). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify PA barriers and facilitators in this population. METHODS: This qualitative study included 4 discussion groups and 16 semi-structured interviews conducted among people with non-specific chronic low back pain who were involved in a specific rehabilitation program or seen in primary care settings. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified: physical factors, psychological factors and socio-environmental factors. The main barrier to PA practice is pain. Psychological barriers were associated with the difficulty in integrating PA in the person's daily life. Environmental barriers were dominated by lack of time. Facilitators identified associated the supervised nature of the physical activity (supervision by professionals) and group practice, which improved people's adherence. CONCLUSION: The results of this study will allow teams to target relevant educational objectives for these people and develop dedicated self-management programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Consultation-based reassurance for patients with low back pain (LBP) in primary care has been shown to be associated with patients' outcomes. Little is known about the role of reassurance in people with LBP consulting with orthopaedic spinal care teams. Reassurance may be important, especially in cases where surgery is not indicated and patients are discharged without treatment. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 patients with chronic disabling musculoskeletal LBP who had recently consulted with spinal orthopaedic care teams. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed. RESULTS: Most patients reported feeling dismissed and discouraged. Patients perceived that they needed specific behaviours from practitioners in order to feel sufficiently reassured to commit to self-management. These behaviours group into four domains: "Knowing my whole story" (evidence that practitioners read the case notes; were familiar with the patients' previous health care history; carried out tests and a physical examination and gathered information about the patients' lifestyle), "Seeing the right person" (showing empathy; listening; building rapport and demonstrating that they are qualified and experienced), "Nothing to worry about" (reducing generic reassuring statements but increasing validating statements recognizing suffering) and "Getting to grips with my problem" (providing explanations and a clear management plan). In the absence of these behaviours, patients rejected advice to self-manage, reported distress, anger and intention to re-consult. CONCLUSION: Effective communication with patients attending spinal orthopaedic care settings is important, especially when no active treatment is being offered. SIGNIFICANCE: This study describes narratives from patients discharged without surgery following consultations with orthopaedic professionals for persistent and debilitating lower back pain. Findings suggest that these interactions are distressful to patients, and that patients require comprehensive and specific reassurance to promote self-management. The findings contribute a unique insight into the special needs of people with complex pain problems and provide guidance to improve consultation-based reassurance in orthopaedic spinal care settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coordinated, interdisciplinary services, supported by self-management underpin effective management for chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, a combination of system, provider and consumer-based barriers exist which limit the implementation of such models into practice, particularly in rural areas where unique access issues exist. In order to improve health service delivery for consumers with CLBP, policymakers and service providers require a more in depth understanding of these issues. The objective of this qualitative study was to explore barriers experienced by consumers in rural settings in Western Australia (WA) to accessing information and services and implementing effective self-management behaviours for CLBP. METHODS: Fourteen consumers with a history of CLBP from three rural sites in WA participated. Maximum variation sampling was employed to ensure a range of experiences were captured. An interviewer, blinded to quantitative pain history data, conducted semi-structured telephone interviews using a standardised schedule to explore individuals' access to information and services for CLBP, and self-management behaviours. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive analysis techniques were used to derive and refine key themes. RESULTS: Five key themes were identified that affected individuals' experiences of managing CLBP in a rural setting, including: 1) poor access to information and services in rural settings; 2) inadequate knowledge and skills among local practitioners; 3) feelings of isolation and frustration; 4) psychological burden associated with CLBP; and 5) competing lifestyle demands hindering effective self-management for CLBP. CONCLUSIONS: Consumers in rural WA experienced difficulties in knowing where to access relevant information for CLBP and expressed frustration with the lack of service delivery options to access interdisciplinary and specialist services for CLBP. Competing lifestyle demands such as work and family commitments were cited as key barriers to adopting regular self-management practices. Consumer expectations for improved health service coordination and a workforce skilled in pain management are relevant to future service planning, particularly in the contexts of workforce capacity, community health services, and enablers to effective service delivery in primary care.

AB  - Management of persistent pain in older adults is challenging given the prevalence of multiple comorbid painful conditions, polypharmacy, age-related changes restricting pharmacological options, and socioeconomic factors. The influences of these factors along with current concern for the use of opioid analgesics highlight the importance of incorporating complementary and integrative medicine approaches. Evidence suggests efficacy and satisfaction with integrating complementary pain management strategies for older adults, especially yoga, massage, and natural products. Nurses and other providers, given their emphasis on holistic care, are in a unique position to lead the transformation of pain management to a patient-centered, self-management style that integrates complementary therapies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Past research has demonstrated that trust is central to an effective therapeutic relationship, but the role of trust in chronic pain management is not well understood. The objective of this study was to provide an in-depth examination of how adults living with chronic pain negotiate trust and demonstrate trustworthiness with clinicians in therapeutic encounters. METHODS: This qualitative study focused on adults living in an urban setting in British Columbia, Canada. Semi-structured interviews (N = 27) were conducted with participants with chronic low back pain. The results were triangulated by two feedback groups comprising re-contacted interview participants (n = 4) and physicians with expertise in pain and addiction management (n = 6). RESULTS: Grounded theory analysis of the adult patient interviews and feedback groups yielded four major themes: 1) threats to trustworthiness and iatrogenic suffering; 2) communicating the invisible and subjective condition of chronic pain; 3) motive, honesty, and testimony; and 4) stigmatized identities. The following two themes emerged from the analysis of the physician feedback group: 1) challenges of the practice context, and 2) complicated clinical relationships. CONCLUSIONS: We found that perceived trustworthiness is important in therapeutic encounters as it helps to negotiate tensions with respect to subjective pain symptoms, addiction, and prescription opioid use. An attitude of epistemic humility may help both clinicians and patients cultivate a trustworthy clinical environment, manage the challenges associated with uncertain testimony, place trust wisely, and promote optimal pain care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic nonspecific low-back pain (CLBP) is a prevalent, costly condition that is remarkably resistant to intervention. Substantial evidence suggests that a mismatch exists between the biomedical beliefs held by clinicians and patients and the biopsychosocial nature of CLBP experience. The aim of this metasynthesis of qualitative studies was to provide clinicians with a richer understanding of their patients' CLBP experience to highlight the importance of moving away from biomedical paradigms in the clinical management of CLBP. METHODS: Qualitative studies exploring the CLBP experience from the perspective of the individual were included. Twenty-five articles representing 18 studies involving 713 participants were subjected to the 3-stage analytic process of extraction/coding, grouping, and abstraction. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: the social construction of CLBP; the psychosocial impact of the nature of CLBP; and coping with CLBP. DISCUSSION: The authors conceptualize the experience of CLBP as biographical suspension in which 3 aspects of suspension are described: suspended "wellness," suspended "self," and suspended "future". The implications of improved clinician understanding of the CLBP experience and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The fear-avoidance model describes how the belief that pain is a sign of damage leads to pain-related fear and avoidance. But other beliefs may also trigger the fear and avoidance responses described by the model. Experts have called for the next generation of fear avoidance research to explore what beliefs underlie pain-related fear and how they evolve. We have previously described damage beliefs and suffering/functional loss beliefs underlying high pain-related fear in a sample of individuals with chronic back pain. The aim of this study is to identify common and differential factors associated with the beliefs in this sample. DESIGN: A qualitative study employing semistructured interviews. SETTING: Musculoskeletal clinics in Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 36 individuals with chronic back pain and high scores on the Tampa Scale (mean 47/68). RESULTS: The overarching theme was a pain experience that did not make sense to the participants. The experience of pain as unpredictable, uncontrollable and intense made it threatening. Attempting to make sense of the threatening pain, participants with damage beliefs drew on past personal experiences of pain, societal beliefs, and sought diagnostic certainty. Met with diagnostic uncertainty, or diagnoses of an underlying pathology that could not be fixed, they were left fearful of damage and confused about how to 'fix' it. Participants with suffering/functional loss beliefs drew on past personal experiences of pain and sought help from healthcare professionals to control their pain. Failed treatments and the repeated failure to achieve functional goals left them unable to make 'sensible' decisions of what to do about their pain. CONCLUSIONS: The findings raise the suggestion that sense-making processes may be implicated in the fear-avoidance model. Future research is needed to explore whether fear reduction may be enhanced by considering beliefs underlying fear and providing targeted intervention to help individuals make sense of their pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) has been shown to reduce pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate participants' experience of CFT by comparing participants who reported differing levels of improvement after participation in CFT, potentially yielding insight into the implementation of this approach. DESIGN: This was a noninterventional, cross-sectional, qualitative study with an interpretive description framework. METHODS: Individuals who had participated in CFT in 2 physical therapy settings (in Ireland and Australia) were recruited through purposive sampling based on disability outcomes postintervention (n=9), and theoretical sampling (n=5). This sampling strategy was used to capture a range of participant experiences but was not used to define the final qualitative groupings. Semistructured interviews were conducted 3 to 6 months postintervention. RESULTS: Three groups emerged from the qualitative analysis: large improvers, small improvers, and unchanged. Two themes encapsulating the key requirements in achieving a successful outcome through CFT were identified: (1) changing pain beliefs and (2) achieving independence. Changing pain beliefs to a more biopsychosocial perspective required a strong therapeutic alliance, development of body awareness, and the experience of control over pain. Independence was achieved by large improvers through newly cultivated problem-solving skills, self-efficacy, decreased fear of pain, and improved stress coping. Residual fear and poor stress coping meant that small improvers were easily distressed and lacked independence. Those who were unchanged continued to feel defined by their pain and retained a biomedical perspective. CONCLUSIONS: A successful outcome after CFT is dependent on instilling biopsychosocial pain beliefs and developing independence among participants. Small improvers may require ongoing support to maintain results. Further study is needed to elucidate the optimal approach for those who were unchanged.

AB  - PURPOSE: Everyday activities are important factors for avoiding the development of chronic low back pain (LBP). The purpose this study was to explore LBP patients' perspective on long-term effects of participating in a counseling intervention designed to motivate them to change work routines and to exercise. METHOD: Follow-up qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were made of 25 LBP patients who had received the counseling intervention. Interviews were transcribed and explored with an interpretative thematic analysis. The findings were organized around Kleinman's conception of "explanatory models". RESULTS: For the individual participant the beliefs about the illness were internally coherent, but most often they were idiosyncratic and fitted to the particular participants' overall explanatory model. Participation in the counseling intervention had created a sense of certainty and potential control over the disease and had legitimized their sick role at work and at home. The majority of the patients reported having integrated exercise into their explanatory models and understood exercise to be beneficial in their continual and concrete management of their LBP. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention had affected the patients' personal agency and space for action. We suggest that this effect was linked to the individually tailored approach drawing on both educational and motivational agents. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Maintaining everyday activities, including retaining one's occupation, is an important factor in low back pain rehabilitation. Counselling on low back pain rehabilitation must be aligned with people's beliefs about their illness. A counselling intervention made patients adopt exercising into their long-term management of low back pain.

AB  - PURPOSE: Considering the need to study the experiences of individuals with musculoskeletal problems in contexts that have not yet been investigated as well as the relevance of fostering a research agenda towards person-centred care, this study aimed to explore the experiences of non-specific chronic low back pain from the perspective of Portuguese individuals living with it. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An interpretative phenomenological analysis was employed to explore the experiences of eight participants, who were recruited purposefully from two primary care centres and one clinic. Semi-structured one-to-one interviews were carried out, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. RESULTS: Three themes were generated as interrelated parts of an extended account that explored the participants' meaning making of their experience: "Non-specific chronic low back pain as a disruptive experience"; "Searching for the meaning of non-specific chronic low back pain"; and, "Clinical encounters that perpetuate the lack of understanding about non-specific chronic low back pain." CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insight into the Portuguese individuals' experiences of non-specific chronic low back pain. Particularly, it suggests that clinical encounters may not be aligned with patients' needs and expectations. These findings may help clinicians in transferring this knowledge to therapeutic approaches to individuals with similar experiences/contexts.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPatients with NSCLBP need to understand their pain and to retain a sense of control over their lives.Encounters with health professionals may perpetuate the lack of understanding about pain and strategies to control it, as patients consider themselves unable to have an active role in the decision-making and are disempowered to deal with their pain.Health professionals should involve patients and promote the co-construction of an explanation that integrates both health professionals' knowledge and patients' narratives. There is a need to align both the patients' and health professionals' perspectives regarding health care in order to implement patient-centred and individually tailored treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper examines from a qualitative approach the role of a patient-centered website - named "Oneself" - on patients' chronic low back pain self-management attitudes and behaviors in the Italian part of Switzerland. METHODS: In-depth interviews have been conducted with a purposive and convenient sample of 18 chronic low back pain sufferers who had used Oneself during 6 months. Data collection and analysis were driven by grounded theory. RESULTS: Reported positive effects of the use of Oneself on self-management attitudes and behaviors include self-comprehension, improvement of argumentative abilities, orientation, development of self-confidence and maintenance of a high level of attention. In some cases, participants affirm to have experienced negative effects such as confusion and discouragement. The individual's previous awareness of cLBP and level of self-management plays a main role in the way people use the website and in its impact. Based on this criterium, a typology of four patterns of use is drawn. CONCLUSION: Patient-centered websites are useful for enhancing self-management of chronic low back pain. However, individuals take advantage of this means differently, based on their stage of advancement in the self-management process. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Information and supports provided online should be tailored according to people's stage of advancement.

AB  - In order to examine expectations for pain treatment and outcome and to determine whether they are influential in maintaining health service consumption 16 adults suffering from chronic pain were interviewed. Transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis. The six main themes to emerge were labelled: Unmet Expectations; Health Professionals; the Importance of Self; Getting Something Done; Back to Square One; and Perceptions of the Future with Ruminations on the Past. Participants revealed considerable agency as they continued in a quest to engage and re-engage with the gatekeepers of health care facilities. The implications for pain management providers are discussed. Copyright © 2007 SAGE Publications Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: This study reports a qualitative analysis of patient experiences following cognitive therapy (CT), mindfulness meditation (MM), or mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for chronic low back pain (CLBP). It aimed to investigate the procedural elements reported by participants as important across these approaches, as well as the role of treatment-related change processes and common factors. Research Method/Design: A qualitative analysis of posttreatment semistructured interviews was conducted with participants who enrolled in a randomized controlled trial comparing MM, CT, and MBCT (N = 57 adults with CLBP). A thematic analysis of transcribed interviews was undertaken by two independent coders; emerging themes, subthemes, and direct quotes were collated, and thematic maps were created. RESULTS: Procedural elements that were both unique (e.g., "cognitive restructuring" in CT) and shared among the three treatments (e.g., "knowledge gained" on pain-related topics) were reported as important. Each treatment was associated with a small number of unique therapeutic processes that were consistent with theoretical tenets underlying the interventions (e.g., "staying in the present moment" in MM). A large number of shared processes and common factors also emerged as important across all three treatments. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: These first-person accounts provide insight into those participant-identified therapeutic procedures and change processes that were most valued by individuals completing cognitive and mindfulness-based interventions for CLBP. Early identification of treatment barriers and strategies to overcome these barriers is necessary. Further, therapeutic rapport and training participants in coping skills they themselves can use were critical, as was engendering changes in cognitive, emotional, and behavioral mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of congruence in the perception of the evolution of back pain during treatment and in the expectations about the future of back pain problems. Congruence was defined as the agreement between patient and therapist on various aspects of back pain problems and of treatment. DESIGN: Semistructured interviews at the beginning and the end of treatment. SUBJECTS: Seventy-one back pain patients and their therapists (6 chiropractors and 6 rheumatologists). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Synthesized index of congruence based on 24 questions asked of both the patient and his/her therapist. RESULTS: The distribution of the congruence scores indicated a high level of congruence in 39.4% of the cases, an average level in 35.2% and a low level in 25.4%. The results demonstrated that congruence was significantly associated with the perception of an improvement in back pain. This positive perception was nevertheless associated with the expectation of persistence or recurrence of the back pain problem in the future. Noncongruence was correlated with the patient's estimation of a less favorable evolution of the back pain problem during the treatment and with a major difficulty for both the therapist and the patient to express clear expectations about the future of the patient's back pain problem. CONCLUSIONS: Congruence mainly reflects an agreement that the treatment is aimed at the management of a long-term condition rather than at the resolution of the back pain problem. Congruent patients seem to accept living with their back problems, a position shared by their therapists, whereas noncongruent patients do not seem to share this conception of back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP) patients' narratives about symptom onset. This investigation aimed to better understand how patients with FM relate to their pain problem and the physicians in charge of making the diagnosis. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We included 56 female patients with FM and 29 with LBP. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, eliciting patients' representations of symptom onset. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed, and content analysis was performed. RESULTS: Patients with FM and LBP were comparable for socio-demographic characteristics and pain duration. Content analysis identified five dimensions: psychological issues, somatic concerns, occupational problems, diagnostic issues, and issues related to chronicity. FM patients emphasized psychological issues, as single events and long-lasting distress. Regarding somatic concerns, gynecological events were prominent in FM while LBP patients emphasized accidents, awkward movements, and physical work conditions. Both groups expressed pessimistic views about pain evolution. FM patients reported diagnosis as an area of major uncertainty in an illness perceived as spreading all over the body. CONCLUSIONS: The narratives of patients with FM expressed high psychological loads and dramatic connotations and emphasized legitimacy issues. In contrast, patients with LBP stressed overload, wear and tear, and treatment inefficacy. The combination of chronicity and lack of specificity may render FM and LBP prone to raise skepticism in the therapists. Investigating and discussing patients' perceptions allows overcoming the apparent uniformity of patients' complaints. It contributes defining realistic and shared treatment goals and help therapists cope with pain chronicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic lower back pain (CLBP), without definable cause, is a symptom commonly presented to GPs, accounting for a significant proportion of their workload; it is also a common reason for sickness absence, and thus of national economic importance. OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study aims to explore how sufferers of CLBP describe their pain and its impact on their lives, and how their problem is dealt with in the consultation with their family doctor. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with a sample of attenders at a back pain clinic set up in general practice. Transcription and analysis was carried out using a grounded-theory approach. RESULTS: Sufferers of CLBP describe withdrawal from normal social obligations, including work. They view their GP as being unable to help and, because of this, the doctor becomes a resource through which their social and economic inactivity can be legitimated. CONCLUSIONS: Presenting with CLBP permits the patient a good deal of power over the GP: it is difficult for the GP to challenge the patient's ideas without damaging the relationship. GPs are forced to collude with the patient's definition of ill-health, which may not be in the best interests of the patient or society.

AB  - Background: Over 50% of older adults experience chronic pain. Poorly managed pain threatens independent functioning, limits social activities and detrimentally affects emotional wellbeing. Yet, chronic pain is not fully understood from older adults’ perspectives; subsequently, pain management in later life is not necessarily based on their priorities or needs. This paper reports a qualitative exploration of older adults’ accounts of living with chronic pain, focusing on how they describe pain, with a view to informing approaches to its assessment. Methods: Cognitively intact men and women aged over sixty-five who lived in the community opted into the study through responding to advertisements in the media and via contacts with groups and organisations in North-East Scotland. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed using a framework approach. Results: Qualitative individual interviews and one group interview were undertaken with 23 older adults. Following analysis, the following main themes emerged: diversity in conceptualising pain using a simple numerical score; personalising the meaning of pain by way of stories, similes and metaphors; and, contextualising pain in relation to its impact on activities. Conclusions: The importance of attending to individuals’ stories as a meaningful way of describing pain for older adults is highlighted, suggesting that a narrative approach, as recommended and researched in other areas of medicine, may usefully be applied in pain assessment for older adults. Along with the judicious use of numerical tools, this requires innovative methods to elicit verbal accounts, such as using similes and metaphors to help older adults describe and discuss their experience, and contextualising the effects of pain on activities that are important to them.

AB  - Yoga has been found to be efficacious in treating chronic low back pain, yet biomedical treatments are most commonly used for pain. Promoting yoga as part of integrative care would reduce exclusive reliance on high-cost, higher-risk biomedical treatments. Attitudes toward yoga play a role in consideration of it as a treatment. The current study examined attitudes toward yoga in adults with chronic low back pain and compared these results to those found in a 2009 general population study. Participants completed a semi-structured interview where they responded to items about perceptions of potential barriers and facilitators to trying yoga. Participant responses were analyzed qualitatively and several common themes emerged. Themes identified by participants indicated there is mixed information about yoga in the public domain and that clarification of what yoga is, how it can be beneficial, and what it requires one to do physically may help promote its use.

AB  - Chronic low back pain is a significant public health problem and, although underused, yoga may be an effective complementary treatment. The current study examined associations of pain catastrophizing and fear of movement with attitudes toward yoga in adults with chronic low back pain. Participants completed three quantitative questionnaires assessing specific constructs: beliefs about yoga, fear of movement, and pain catastrophizing. A semi-structured in-person interview was then conducted to obtain specific pain-related information. Hierarchical regression and mediational analyses were used to test hypotheses. Consistent with the fear-avoidance model of chronic pain, catastrophizing and fear of movement were negatively associated with yoga attitudes. Specifically, fear of movement was a mediator between catastrophizing and attitudes toward yoga. Individuals with higher levels of catastrophizing and fear of movement may be less likely to consider a pain treatment involving physical movement.

AB  - A small qualitative study was carried out to gain an in-depth understanding of individual patients' experiences of chronic low back pain (CLBP), and active rehabilitation. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with seven individuals who had attended an outpatient back rehabilitation group (BRG). The audio-taped interviews were transcribed, and analysed to develop coding categories. These data were illuminated by detailed field notes kept by the researcher throughout the study. The emergent themes were the participants' perceptions of their health and quality of life, the group culture and dynamics of the treatment programme, and their experiences outside the hospital environment. Participants continued to express dependence on the healthcare professions, and despite improved physical fitness and an increased sense of well-being, experienced no improvement in feelings of control over pain. Encouraging physical activity did not appear to promote self-reliance. Further research, and our clinical practice, should continue to address the cognitive aspects of CLBP, which so influence the outcome of treatment.

Communication was the most important dimension, underpinning the five other dimensions as well as being a distinct dimension of patient-centred physiotherapy.Conclusions: Physiotherapists should have an understanding of the six dimensions of patient-centred physiotherapy for CLBP. Improving physiotherapists' communication skills may better facilitate patient-centred physiotherapy, and therefore enhance the experience of physiotherapy for this client group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the extent to which physiotherapy facilitated chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients to self-manage following discharge, and to explore patients' perceptions of their need for self-management interventions or support and their preferences in terms of delivery. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to explore patients' perceptions of various aspects of physiotherapy management of CLBP. SETTING: Physiotherapy departments in one geographical area of the UK National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five people who had received physiotherapy for CLBP within the previous 6 months. RESULTS: Adoption of self-management strategies was not achieved consistently in this group of participants. There was a strongly perceived need for self-management support following discharge from physiotherapy. Exercises were reportedly the most common self-management strategy in use. However, it was common for participants to perceive that physiotherapy had little influence on their CLBP management following discharge. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CLBP patients could be better facilitated to manage their condition. Providing self-management education in addition to the patient information and education provided traditionally, and providing self-management support in the form of direct access and/or review appointments or telephone calls is worthy of further investigation in this patient group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions of patients, physiotherapists, and potential peer mentors on the topic of peer-mentoring for self-management of chronic low back pain following discharge from physiotherapy. DESIGN: Exploratory, qualitative study. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve patients, 11 potential peer mentors and 13 physiotherapists recruited from physiotherapy departments and community locations in one health board area of the UK. INTERVENTIONS: Semi-structured interviews and focus groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' perceptions of the usefulness and appropriateness of peer-mentoring following discharge from physiotherapy. Data were processed and analysed using the framework method. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified: (i) self-management strategies, (ii) barriers to self-management and peer-mentoring, (iii) vision of peer-mentoring, and (iv) the voice of experience. Peer-mentoring may be beneficial for some older adults with chronic low back pain. Barriers to peer-mentoring were identified, and many solutions for overcoming them. No single format was identified as superior; participants emphasised the need for any intervention to be flexible and individualised. Important aspects to consider in developing a peer-mentoring intervention are recruitment and training of peer mentors and monitoring the mentor-mentee relationship. CONCLUSIONS: This study has generated important knowledge that is being used to design and test a peer-mentoring intervention on a group of older people with chronic low back pain and volunteer peer mentors. If successful, peer-mentoring could provide a cost effective method of facilitating longer-term self-management of a significant health condition in older people.

AB  - AIMS: The aim was to investigate peoples' experiences of the impact of chronic low back pain. BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a complex disorder with wide-ranging adverse consequences that can impact on people's lifestyles and self-image. It is also a condition that can sometimes be treated with some scepticism by health care providers and other people in the person's life. It has been suggested that further research into the subjective experience of chronic blow back pain is needed to develop a better understanding of its impact. DESIGN: This study is a qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 64 participants identified as having chronic low back pain who were interviewed about the impact of the condition on their lives. The data were analysed using a method of inductive thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Four main themes were identified: the unpredictability of the pain, the need for vigilance, the externalization/objectification of the body and the alteration to sense of self. CONCLUSION: Nurses have an important role to play in working with patients experiencing chronic low back pain to identify any patterns associated with exacerbations of the condition, validating their experiences of chronic low back pain and facilitating the accommodation of chronic low back pain into a more satisfying sense of self.

AB  - AIMS: This paper is a report of a study of the self-management strategies of people with chronic low back pain and how their healthcare professionals perceived their role in facilitating self-management. BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a complex disorder, challenging to treat, and associated with wide-ranging adverse consequences including physical disability, psychosocial disruption, and increased use of healthcare resources. Most clinical guidelines suggest that self-management strategies are the best treatment option. DESIGN: A qualitative analysis was conducted of semi-structured interviews with 64 people identified as having chronic low back pain and 22 healthcare professionals nominated by that person. The interviews were conducted in 2008. The people with chronic low back pain were asked about their self-management strategies; healthcare professionals were asked about how they perceived their role in the person's self-management. Data were analysed using a content analysis. FINDINGS: The most common strategies used by participants to manage their chronic low back pain were medication, exercise and application of heat. The nominated healthcare professionals were predominantly physiotherapists and general practitioners. Physiotherapists described exercises, particularly those aimed at improving core strength, as the main strategy that they encouraged people to use. General practitioners regarded themselves as primarily having three roles: prescription of pain medication, dispensing of sickness certificates, and referral to specialists. CONCLUSION: People with chronic low back pain use self-management strategies that they have discovered to provide relief and to prevent exacerbation. The strategies reflect an active process of decision-making that combines personal experience with professional recommendations.

AB  - Objectives Patients with chronic back pain encounter considerable psychological and social challenges. In particular, the ever-evolving relationship between chronic back pain, sense of self-efficacy, and perceived role in interpersonal relationships merits further investigation. Methods We conducted in-person semi-structured interviews with 20 adult patients attending a specialized interventional spine pain clinic. The interview transcripts were subjected to inductive thematic analysis, and themes were labeled descriptively. Participant responses were intentionally not analyzed within the context of an existing theoretical framework, so that the content of participant responses would directly drive the emphasis of the findings. Results Participants described chronic back pain as a lonely struggle amid diminished capacity to work, enjoy leisure time, and contribute to social relationships. Feelings of needing to handle pain independently contrasted with the reality of having to rely on others for help, and this tension was a source of anxiety. Discussion The experience of chronic back pain was characterized by a conflict between the desire for self-efficacy, a sense of isolation, and the paradoxical need to rely on others. Interventions that allow patients to navigate this struggle by seeking help for their diminished capability, while retaining a sense of autonomy and self-worth, are indicated.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the formation and impact of attitudes and beliefs among people experiencing acute and chronic low back pain. METHODS: Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 participants with acute low back pain (less than 6 weeks' duration) and 11 participants with chronic low back pain (more than 3 months' duration) from 1 geographical region within New Zealand. Data were analyzed using an Interpretive Description framework. RESULTS: Participants' underlying beliefs about low back pain were influenced by a range of sources. Participants experiencing acute low back pain faced considerable uncertainty and consequently sought more information and understanding. Although participants searched the Internet and looked to family and friends, health care professionals had the strongest influence upon their attitudes and beliefs. Clinicians influenced their patients' understanding of the source and meaning of symptoms, as well as their prognostic expectations. Such information and advice could continue to influence the beliefs of patients for many years. Many messages from clinicians were interpreted as meaning the back needed to be protected. These messages could result in increased vigilance, worry, guilt when adherence was inadequate, or frustration when protection strategies failed. Clinicians could also provide reassurance, which increased confidence, and advice, which positively influenced the approach to movement and activity. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals have a considerable and enduring influence upon the attitudes and beliefs of people with low back pain. It is important that this opportunity is used to positively influence attitudes and beliefs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioids are one of the most prescribed treatments for chronic pain (CP). However, their long-term use (>3 months) has been surrounded by controversy, due to loss of beneficial effects. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of people with chronic non-malignant low back pain in Spain undergoing long-term treatment with opioids. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews at the Pain Clinic with persons taking opioid treatment. METHODS: The interviews were analysed by qualitative content analysis as described by Graneheim and Lundman, and developed categories and themes discussed in light of a biomedicalization framework. MAIN RESULTS: We developed one overarching theme-Living with opioids: dependence and autonomy while seeking relief-and three categories: The long pathway to opioids due to the invisibility of pain; Opioids: from blind date to a long-term relationship; and What opioids cannot fix. DISCUSSION: The long and difficult road to find effective treatments was a fundamental part of coping with pain, involving long-term relationships with the health system. This study reflects the benefits, and drawbacks of opioids, along with struggles to maintain autonomy and make decisions while undergoing long-term treatment with opioids. The paper also highlights the consequences of pain in the economy, family and social life of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' experiences should be considered to a greater extent by health-care professionals when giving information about opioids and setting treatment goals. Greater consideration of the social determinants of health that affect CP experiences might lead to more effective solutions to CP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence-based guidelines for low back pain (LBP) recommend multiple diverse approaches to treatment and suggest considering patient preferences when formulating a treatment plan. AIM: To explore patient preferences and to identify patients' beliefs about LBP treatments. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative study using focus groups in primary care in South-West England. METHOD: Thirteen focus groups were organised with a purposive sample of 75 adults with LBP. Group discussions of LBP treatments were facilitated, audiorecorded, and the verbatim transcripts thematically analysed. RESULTS: Eight themes were identified, four related to treatment beliefs and four to seeking treatment. Treatment beliefs comprised participants' expectations and appraisals of specific treatments, which were underpinned by four distinct dimensions: credibility, effectiveness, concerns and individual fit. Treatment beliefs were expressed in the broader context of treatment seeking: participants' primary concern was to obtain a clear explanation of their LBP which went beyond a diagnostic label and provided an understanding of the cause(s) of their LBP. They described engaging in self-management activities and claimed they were willing to try anything if it might help them. Participants wanted an empathic and expert practitioner who could deliver a suitable treatment (or refer them on to someone else) and help them to negotiate the challenges of the healthcare system. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of helping patients develop coherent illness representations about their LBP before trying to engage them in treatment-decisions, uptake, or adherence. Addressing patients' illness and treatment perceptions in clinical practice could improve shared decision making and patient outcomes.

AB  - Background: In the management of long-term conditions, the role of physiotherapy and the construct of person-centred care are evolving. Though it is discussed thoroughly in some disciplines, theorising about person-centred care is embryonic in the physiotherapy literature, with evidence suggesting ambiguity regarding its conceptualisation and application. Aim: To critically review evidence for barriers to, and facilitators of, person-centred care in adults living with long-term conditions in a physiotherapy context, and identify its components and outcomes in practice. Method: A systematic electronic search strategy to identify quantitative, qualitative and mixedmethods studies that collected data relating to the concept of person-centred care and included physiotherapists working with adults (≥18 years) living with long-term conditions in any setting. Findings: Four quantitative studies, three qualitative and one mixed-methods (a total of eight articles), were selected for critique and synthesis. Outcomes identified by the authors included perceived selfmanagement and 'patient'-centredness, self-efficacy (assessed using the six-item chronic disease selfefficacy scale, and the pain self-efficacy questionnaire) and quality of life (assessed using the short form-36 quality of life questionnaire). Components of person-centred care were identified as selfmanagement, ongoing care, decision making, individualisation, information sharing and goal setting. Evidence suggests barriers and facilitators may be influenced by the key stakeholders in processes, outcomes and contexts of care delivery. Conclusions: There is limited, mixed-quality evidence in relation to person-centred care in physiotherapy practice for management of long-term conditions. This review synthesises concepts described in the physiotherapy literature in a conceptual framework, which is contrasted with existing models and frameworks relating to person-centred care, to trigger further discussion. Implications for practice: •There is a need to study physiotherapists' awareness of the complexity of person-centred care in practice •Quality of evidence is mixed, highlighting a need for further exploration within physiotherapy contexts •Evidence suggests person-centred care can be better delivered by physiotherapists if they address barriers and enhance facilitators to its enactment

AB  - Background: Ai Chi is a specific form of mindful aquatic intervention related to Qigong and Tai Chi. Although evidence suggests that Qigong and Tai Chi are effective in reducing pain and improving balance, functional mobility, and quality of life (QOL), limited studies have explored the therapeutic benefits of Ai Chi. Purpose: To summarize available research on Ai Chi for balance, pain, functional mobility, and QOL in adults. Methods: Systematic search included PubMed, CINAHL, Health Source Nursing, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus databases. Selection criteria included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials (NRCTs), and cohort studies with Ai Chi as the main intervention for adults with report of at least one standardized outcome measure for balance, pain, functional mobility, or QOL. Results: Twenty-two articles, with a total of 710 participants, met the inclusion criteria including 11 RCTs, 5 NRCTs, and 6 cohort studies. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 75 years. The most frequent study population was persons with Parkinson disease. This review also included studies with other populations such as adults with fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, chronic stroke, chronic low back pain, balance deficits, intellectual disability, and knee osteoarthritis, as well as healthy adults. Ai Chi intervention treatment dosage varied from 20 to 60 minutes, 1 to 12 times per week, for 1 to 20 weeks. Comparison groups included alternative aquatic interventions, land-based exercise, acupuncture, and nonintervention control. Six of the 22 studies were considered moderate to high quality. Discussion: The qualitative analysis reveals a number of favorable results with benefits from Ai Chi intervention and can guide future research. Conclusions: Heterogeneity between all studies precludes conclusive findings of results about the efficacy of Ai Chi from this review. Current evidence suggests a need for better designed controlled trials with a larger sample size to carefully control for bias and judiciously select outcomes.

AB  - Objectives. Lower back pain (LBP) is extremely prevalent in seafood harvesters who often have limited or no access to ergonomic consultation, occupational health support and rehabilitation services. This pilot study aimed to describe a participatory ergonomic approach and determine the feasibility and extent of adoption of self-management strategies in clam farmers with LBP. Methods. A rapid prototype participatory ergonomic approach was used to develop context-specific self-management strategies. Options to adjust lifting and repetitive stress were introduced using video clips, demonstrations and discussions in the workplace. Workers chose and implemented three strategies for 8 weeks with weekly reminders. Survey and qualitative data from focus groups were analyzed. Results. Team strategies were the most popular, but individual options were used more often. Strategies were considered feasible, acceptable and relatively easy to use. Strategies were implemented relatively consistently, and most improved productivity with decreased pain. Challenges for uptake included changing habit, culture and team dynamics. Conclusions. Participatory rapid prototyping provided a feasible and efficient option to introduce strategies for clam farmers with small teams, variable work processes and workloads, and time restrictions. Strategies were considered acceptable and easy to use, and most increased productivity. These methods show potential for future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between patient expectations about a treatment and the treatment outcomes, particularly for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies, is not well understood. Using qualitative data from a larger study to develop a valid expectancy questionnaire for use with participants starting new CAM therapies, we examined how participants' expectations of treatment changed over the course of a therapy. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 64 participants initiating one of four CAM therapies (yoga, chiropractic, acupuncture, massage) for chronic low back pain. Participants just starting treatment were interviewed up to three times over a period of 3 months. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a qualitative mixed methods approach incorporating immersion/crystallization and matrix analysis for a decontexualization and recontextualization approach to understand changes in thematic emphasis over time. RESULTS: Pre-treatment expectations consisted of conjecture about whether or not the CAM therapy could relieve pain and improve participation in meaningful activities. Expectations tended to shift over the course of treatment to be more inclusive of broader lifestyle factors, the need for long-term pain management strategies and attention to long-term quality of life and wellness. Although a shift toward greater acceptance of chronic pain and the need for strategies to keep pain from flaring was observed across participants regardless of therapy, participants varied in their assessments of whether increased awareness of the need for ongoing self-care and maintenance strategies was considered a "positive outcome". Regardless of how participants evaluated the outcome of treatment, participants from all four therapies reported increased awareness, acceptance of the chronic nature of pain, and attention to the need to take responsibility for their own health. CONCLUSIONS: The shift in treatment expectations to greater acceptance of pain and the need for continued self-care suggests that future research should explore how CAM practitioners can capitalize on these shifts to encourage feelings of empowerment rather than disappointment surrounding realizations of the need for continued engagement with self-care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is continuing uncertainty in back pain research as to which treatment is best suited to patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP). In this study, Gestalt therapy and the shock trauma method Somatic Experiencing R (SE) were used as interventions in parallel with the usual cross-disciplinary approach. The aim was to investigate how these treatments influence a patient's capacity to cope with CLBP when it is coupled with depression. METHODS: In this qualitative explorative study, a phenomenological-hermeneutic framework was adopted. Patients were recruited on the basis of following criteria: A moderate depression score of 23-30 according to the Beck Depression Inventory Scale and a pain score of 7-10 (Box scale from 0-10) and attendance at five- six psychotherapeutic sessions. Six patients participated in the study. The data was comprised of written field notes from each session, which were subsequently analysed and interpreted at three levels: naive reading, structural analysis and critical interpretation and discussion. RESULTS: Three areas of focus emerged: the significance of previous experiences, restrictions in everyday life and restoration of inner resources during the therapy period. The study revealed a diversity of psychological stressors that related to loss and sorrow, being let down, violations, traumatic events and reduced functioning, which led to displays of distress, powerlessness, reduced self-worth, anxiety and discomfort.Overall, the sum of the stressors together with pain and depression were shown to trigger stress symptoms. Stress was down-played in the psychotherapeutic treatment and inner resources were re-established, which manifested as increased relaxation, presence, self-worth, sense of responsibility and happiness. This, in turn, assisted the patients to better manage their CLBP. CONCLUSIONS: CLBP is a stress factor in itself but when coupled with depression, they can be regarded as two symptom complexes that mutually affect each other in negative ways. When pain, stress and depression become overwhelming and there are few internal resources available, stress seems to become prominent. In this study, Gestalt therapy and the SE-method may have helped to lower the six patients' level of stress and restore their own internal resources, thereby increasing their capacity to cope with their CLBP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to explore perceptions of people with chronic neck or low back pain about how characteristics of home exercise programs and care-provider style during clinical encounters may affect adherence to exercises. METHODS: This is a qualitative study consisting of seven focus groups, with a total of 34 participants presenting chronic neck or low back pain. The subjects were included if they were receiving physiotherapy treatment and were prescribed home-based exercises. RESULTS: Two themes emerged: home-based exercise programme conditions and care provider's style. In the first theme, the participants described their positive and negative experiences regarding time consumption, complexity and effects of prescribed exercises. In the second theme, participants perceived more bonding to prescribed exercises when their care provider presented knowledge about the disease, promoted feedback and motivation during exercise instruction, gave them reminders to exercise, or monitored their results and adherence to exercises. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiential findings indicate that patient's adherence to home-based exercise is more likely to happen when care providers' style and the content of exercise programme are positively experienced. These findings provide additional information to health care providers, by showing which issues should be considered when delivering health care to patients presenting chronic neck or back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common health problem with challenges for providing satisfactory care. This study was undertaken to identify opportunities to improve key aspects of physicians' communications with CLBP-affected patients. METHODS: A series of 3 focus groups, each with 7 to 11 patients with CLBP, were recruited from primary care settings and grouped by risk level of reduced function resulting from back pain, to elicit perspectives about interactions with their primary care physicians. Analysis of focus group transcripts used an iterative process based on a thematic approach and a priori concepts. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients participated in the focus groups. Patient comments about communicating with physicians around CLBP fit into themes of listening and empathy, validating pain experiences, conducting effective CLBP assessment, providing clear diagnosis and information, and collaboratively working on treatment. Patients shared that physicians can foster positive interactions with CLBP-affected patients by sharing personal experiences of chronic pain, being truthful about not having all the answers and being clear about how patients can benefit from referrals, reviewing the patient's previous treatments before beginning conversations about treatment options, providing follow-up instructions, giving patients a diagnosis beyond "chronic pain," and explaining the role of imaging in their care. CONCLUSION: This study provides specific steps that physicians in the US can take to improve physician-patient interactions during primary care visits pertaining to CLBP. The findings could inform physician training, development of educational materials for patients, and future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Enhanced Transtheoretical Model Intervention (ETMI) is an approach for treating chronic low back pain (CLBP), which demonstrated clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes. ETMI highlights reassurance, return to normal activities and encouragement of recreational physical activity. In order to optimally implement ETMI, it is important to gain an understanding of the expectations and perceptions of patients before they engage with the intervention. OBJECTIVES: To explore CLBP patients' perceptions and expectations of the ETMI method prior to their first consultation with physiotherapist. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 CLBP patients. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analysed thematically. Patients were first asked about their expectations of treatment, then they were asked to comment on the ETMI method. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged from the interviews: (1) Patient's perceptions of LBP; (2) patient's expectations from current physiotherapy and (3) Patient's expectations from ETMI method. The patients' perceptions of back pain centred on biomechanical causal factors, a desire for diagnostic tests and beliefs that rest cures the pain. Their expectations from current physiotherapy included pain reduction, passive treatment, a structured exercise program and clear information about LBP. In reference to the ETMI method, patients expected pain reduction, practical tools to self-manage, and a combination of ETMI with passive treatment. CONCLUSION: addressing issues around patient's perceptions and expectations of current physiotherapy and of the ETMI method, prior to their first consultation with physiotherapist, could be beneficial for understanding how to improve the ETMI implementation in the health care system.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Telehealth is a promising approach to support self-management with the potential to overcome geographical barriers. Understanding patient perspectives will identify practical challenges to delivering self-management strategies by telehealth. The aim of this study was to synthesize the perceptions of people with chronic musculoskeletal pain for engaging in interventions delivered using telehealth. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, and PsycINFO databases. We included qualitative studies that explored perceptions or experiences or attitudes of people with chronic musculoskeletal pain engaging with telehealth. We assessed the methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Meta-synthesis was guided by a thematic synthesis approach. The level of confidence of review findings was assessed using the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Studies (GRADE-CERQual). Twenty-one studies were included (n = 429). Telehealth comprised web-based, videoconference-based, telephone-based, video-based, and smartphone app-based programs delivered solely or combined. Chronic musculoskeletal conditions included people with knee or hip osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain, persistent pain (chronic joint pain or nonspecific chronic musculoskeletal pain), rheumatoid arthritis, and functional fatigue syndrome. The enablers for engaging in telehealth interventions were as follows: (1) "at my own pace, space, and place" and (2) empowered patient. Barriers to engaging in telehealth interventions were as follows: (1) impersonal, (2) technological challenges, (3) irrelevant content, and (4) limited digital (health) literacy. Telehealth interventions with well-designed interactive platforms, flexibility to fit patients' routine, and the broad availability of material may favor better engagement. Encouragement of self-efficacy is linked to successful telehealth-delivered self-management programs.

AB  - <b>Introduction:</b> The potential use of cannabis and cannabinoid products for the treatment of low-back pain is an important area for investigation. As one of the leading reasons to visit a primary care provider, low-back pain results in a significant burden of disease in both the United States' economic and health care systems. Given the current opioid epidemic, it is important to seek novel analgesics and understand their efficacy for myriad pain conditions, including low-back pain. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A systematic review was performed using multiple online databases to assess the association of cannabis use and low-back pain in the literature.

AB  - Patients are encouraged to take an active role in self-managing their chronic back pain and functional problems. However, research suggests that patients do not self-manage, and they expect health professionals to fulfill a comprehensive role in managing pain. A partnership between patients and health professionals is called for, and self-management works best when they share knowledge and work together toward optimal goals. To explore how patients' partnerships with health professionals may influence their ability to self-manage pain by exploring patients' experiences. A grounded theory approach with in-depth, semistructured interviews was undertaken. Each interview was analyzed using constant comparative analysis. This study was nested within a larger study on patient-professional partnerships and the self-management of chronic back pain. Twenty-six patients with chronic back pain were recruited in a community-based pain management service in Northern England, United Kingdom. Three themes emerged: building partnerships with health professionals; being supported by health professionals to self-manage the pain; and experiencing a change in self-management. Five approaches that underpinned health professionals' self-management support were identified. Facilitators of and barriers to a good partnership were reported. This study suggests that a good patient-professional partnership has a positive effect on patients' self-management ability. A theoretical model explaining how such partnership may influence self-management was developed. It is necessary for both patients and health professionals to be aware of their partnerships, which may enhance the effect of pain management services.

AB  - Chronic back pain is common, and its self-management may be a lifelong task for many patients. While health professionals can provide a service or support for pain, only patients can actually experience it. It is likely that optimum self-management of chronic back pain may only be achieved when patients and professionals develop effective partnerships which integrate their complementary knowledge and skills. However, at present, there is no evidence to explain how such partnerships can influence patients' self-management ability. This review aimed to explore the influence of patient-professional partnerships on patients' ability to self-manage chronic back pain, and to identify key factors within these partnerships that may influence self-management. A systematic review was undertaken, aiming to retrieve relevant studies using any research method. Five databases were searched for papers published between 1980 and 2014, including Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO. Eligible studies were those reporting on patients being supported by professionals to self-manage chronic back pain; patients being actively involved for self-managing chronic back pain; and the influence of patient-professional partnerships on self-management of chronic back pain. Included studies were critically appraised for quality, and findings were extracted and analysed thematically. A total of 738 studies were screened, producing 10 studies for inclusion, all of which happened to use qualitative methods. Seven themes were identified: communication, mutual understanding, roles of health professionals, information delivery, patients' involvement, individualised care and healthcare service. These themes were developed into a model suggesting how factors within patient-professional partnerships influence self-management. Review findings suggest that a partnership between patients and professionals supports patients' self-management ability, and effective communication is a fundamental factor underpinning their partnerships in care. It also calls for the development of individualised healthcare services offering self-referral or telephone consultation to patients with chronic conditions.

AB  - Supporting patients in forming partnerships with health professionals is the key of effective self-management. This study aimed to explore the nature of patient-professional partnerships and its related factors that create facilitators and barriers to patients' self-management ability. A constructivist grounded theory approach was undertaken. Three main themes emerged: interaction and communication, integrated care, and service and system. A theoretical model was generated that posits effective communication, individualized integrated care, and high-quality service as key influences on the successful development of patient-professional partnerships and patients' ability to self-manage. Giving attention to these factors helps understand the development, implementation, mechanisms, and evaluation of building a patient-professional partnership and maximizes the opportunities for patient self-management of chronic pain. Future research and practice are needed to move beyond a simplistic focus on health outcomes to address the complex links between partnerships and treatment delivery processes, and interventions, effects, and patients' context.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management is recommended for patients with chronic back pain. Health professionals' support for self-management can be more effective when working in partnership with patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between patient-professional partnerships and the self-management of chronic back pain. METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed methods study was undertaken. Adults with chronic back pain referred to pain management clinics participated at baseline and 3-month follow-up. Their pain severity, partnerships with health professionals and self-management ability were measured. Hierarchical linear regression was undertaken to examine the strength of the associations between partnerships and self-management. A subsample was interviewed about experiences of the impact of patient-professional partnerships on their self-management ability, using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: A total of 147 patients were recruited and 103 (70%) patients completed the follow-up. A strong association (p < 0.001) was detected between patient-professional partnerships and all dimensions of self-management ability. This was validated by interviews with a subsample of 26 patients. Four themes emerged as follows: connecting with health professionals, being supported through partnerships, feeling positive and making progress towards self-management, and acknowledging the impact but feeling no difference. CONCLUSIONS: Developing a partnership in care may improve patients' ability to gain knowledge, manage side effects and symptoms and adhere to treatment. It helped strengthen health professionals' support and produce a sense of safety for patients. Guiding health professionals in building partnerships where expectations are acknowledged and tailored information and support are provided could be considered as part of the standard education and training. SIGNIFICANCE: This study identified and validated strong associations between patient-professional partnerships and self-management. Support for self-management alone may not be sufficient, and building partnerships where patients and professionals work together towards agreed goals make an essential contribution to helping increase patients' ability to self-manage chronic back pain.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to explore the experiences and perceptions of adult patients with chronic musculoskeletal conditions following a Pilates exercise programme. A qualitative approach was taken to both data collection and analysis, with alignment to the philosophy of interpretive phenomenology. Participants included 15 women and seven men with a range of chronic musculoskeletal conditions, including nonspecific low back pain, peripheral joint osteoarthritis and a range of postsurgical conditions. The age range was from 36 years to 83 years, and the mean age was 57 years (standard deviation 14.1 years). METHODS: Data were collected via digital recordings of four focus groups in three North-West of England physiotherapy clinics. The data were transcribed verbatim and then analysed using a thematic framework. Data were verified by a researcher and randomly selected participants, and agreement was achieved between all parties. RESULTS: The results were organized into five main themes: physical improvements; Pilates promotes an active lifestyle: improved performance at work and hobbies; psychosocial benefits and improved confidence; increased autonomy in managing their own condition; and motivation to continue with exercise. CONCLUSION: The study was the first to investigate individual perceptions of the impact of Pilates on the daily lives of people with chronic conditions. The Pilates-based exercise programme enabled the participants to function better and manage their condition more effectively and independently. Further to previous work, the study revealed psychological and social benefits which increase motivation to adhere to the programme and promote a healthier lifestyle.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, there is an increasing number of older adults, the majority of whom remain living at home. Not infrequently they live with long-term pain, especially musculoskeletal pain, which is associated with increased disability (physical, psychological, social) and a negative impact on quality of life. A deeper understanding of how older adults experience living with this type of pain is needed in order to improve well-being and quality of life. The study focused on the actual experience by living with this global, prevailing and disabling type of pain. The aim was to describe commonalities in how older adults endure long-term musculoskeletal pain in their daily life at home. Methods: This inductive, descriptive study included qualitative semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 19 participants (66 to 88 years) in their homes. Qualitative content analysis by Graneheim and Lundman was used to identify themes crossing participants’ experiences of enduring long-term pain in their daily life. Interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Results: All participants felt forced into “learning to live with pain” (main theme), in order to endure their pain. In time, they learned that: taking the pain as it comes, one day at a time; balancing the pain with activity, thoughts and emotions; self-talking; trying to be less of a burden to family and others; and capturing, enjoying and valuing moments of pleasure (sub-themes) helped them endure the pain. Conclusions: This experience was dominated by learning. The approaches generated to learn to endure pain in daily living by these participants should be discussed with older adults in similar situations for further additions, refinements and validation. Nurses can help to ease the older adult’s suffering by tailoring individualized and holistic care focused on guiding the older adult in learning to live with pain and preserving and promoting health and well-being with a maximum of care and a minimum of intrusion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus regarding the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for management of chronic musculoskeletal pain or chronic low back pain. A recent review of previous trial methodology identified significant problems with low treatment fidelity. There is little information available to guide selection of patient-reported outcome measures appropriate for TENS evaluation. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of patients at a secondary care pain clinic who successfully used TENS to help manage chronic musculoskeletal pain. These key informants were selected because they had the potential to generate knowledge that could inform research design and clinical practice. DESIGN: A qualitative method using individual semistructured interviews with open questions was selected for its capacity to generate rich data. METHODS: A mini focus group informed the development of a discussion guide for semistructured interviews with 9 patients (6 women, 3 men). Thematic analysis was used as the primary data analysis method, and this analysis was enhanced by a case-level analysis of the context and processes of TENS use of each individual. RESULTS: Data analysis indicated that distraction from pain and a reduction in the sensations associated with muscle tension or spasm should be considered as separate outcomes from pain relief. These direct benefits led to a wide range of indirect benefits dependent on patient decision making, including medication reduction, enhanced function, psychological benefits, and enhanced ability to rest. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that evaluating TENS using a unidimensional pain scale is likely to overlook potential benefits. The complex pattern of TENS usage, as well as multiple direct and indirect outcomes, indicates that TENS could be considered as a complex intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) could offer a non-drug form of pain relief, but there is no consensus regarding its effectiveness for chronic musculoskeletal pain or chronic low back pain. A recent review of previous trial methods identified significant problems with low treatment fidelity. There is little information available to inform the development of a pragmatic implementation design for a TENS evaluation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of patients who were receiving secondary care in a pain clinic and who had expertise in using TENS to manage chronic musculoskeletal pain. These key informants were selected because they had the potential to generate knowledge that could inform research design and clinical practice. DESIGN: A qualitative method using individual semistructured interviews with open questions was selected for its capacity to generate rich data. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 9 patients (6 women, 3 men). Thematic analysis was used as the primary data analysis method, and this analysis was enhanced by a case-level analysis of the context and processes of TENS use of each individual. RESULTS: Data analysis indicated that patients learned to address a range of problems in order to optimize TENS use. Patients may need to personalize the positioning of electrodes and the TENS settings and to readjust them over time. Patients learned to use TENS in a strategic manner, and the outcomes of each strategy varied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicated that a pragmatic TENS evaluation may need to incorporate a learning phase to allow patients to optimize this complex pattern of TENS usage, and evaluation may need to be sensitive to the outcomes of strategic use. These findings also have implications for clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify information needs among a group of back pain sufferers as well as the barriers that may prevent them from accessing this information. DESIGN: Data were collected through the use of open, in-depth interviews, through contributions to the Norwegian Back Pain Association's online discussion list, and through a search of the literature. PARTICIPANTS: Norwegian back pain sufferers and their carers. MAIN VARIABLES STUDIED: Information needs and barriers. RESULTS: The informants described information needs that covered a wide range of topics, clinical, financial, emotional and social. Informants wanted to understand the cause of their pain and wanted information about existing diagnoses and diagnostic procedures. Informants asked for information about treatment alternatives, both within and outside the established health-care system, the effects of these treatment alternatives, their procedures, side-effects and costs. In addition, informants wanted information about the social and emotional effects of long-term pain; coping with everyday life; other people's experiences; and about welfare benefits and patient rights. Barriers to this information included the use of medical, legal and other jargon, doctors' lack of time, lack of communication skills, lack of knowledge about back pain and attitudes to back pain patients. CONCLUSIONS: To successfully address the questions and concerns of users, there should be an attempt to present information on as many of these topics as possible. Information should be presented in the user's own language, at several levels of understanding, and should include both evidence- and experienced-based knowledge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In an evidence-informed patient choice the patient has access to research-based information about the effectiveness of health care options and is encouraged to use this information in treatment decisions. This concept has seen growing popularity in recent years. However, we still know relatively little about users' attitudes to the use of research-based information, possibly because people have been unexposed to this type of information. After developing the BackInfo website where the results of Cochrane systematic reviews on the effects of low back pain were adapted and presented to lay users we evaluated how users responded to this information. METHODS: Focus group meetings were held with 18 chronic back pain sufferers, after they had been sent a link to the website before the meetings. RESULTS: The focus groups suggest that the most important challenges to the use of BackInfo's research-based information are not primarily tied to the comprehension or presentation of the information, but are mainly associated with participants' attitudes towards the credibility of research and researchers, and the applicability of research results to themselves as individuals. Possible explanations for participants' lack of trust in research and their apparent difficulties in applying this research to their own situations include aspects that may be typical for the general public including the media's presentation of research, and a lack of familiarity with and feelings of distance to research evidence. Other aspects may be typical for patient groups with chronic and unclear medical conditions, such as a lack of trust in the health care establishment in general. CONCLUSION: In order to enhance the credibility and applicability of research evidence, providers of research-based information could explore a number of possibilities including the use of including personal stories to illustrate the research outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the approach used by a physiotherapist who led a rehabilitation programme for injured members of the military with chronic low back pain designed to enhance self-efficacy and self-management skills. METHOD: This in-depth qualitative study used audio- and video-recorded data from interviews and field observations. Using an inductive analysis process, discussion of emerging themes led to a description of the physiotherapist's approach. RESULTS: The approach has three elements: developing a trusting relationship through building rapport, establishing a need in patients' minds to be actively engaged in their rehabilitation, and finding workable rehabilitation solutions that are most likely to be adopted by individual patients. This approach fits into current theories about health behaviour change (e.g., Transtheoretical Model of Change, Motivational Interviewing, Motivational Model of Patient Self-Management and Patient Self-Management) and elements of the therapeutic alliance. Using the therapeutic alliance (rapport) and behaviour change techniques, the physiotherapist focused on the perceived importance of a behaviour change (need) and then shifted to the patient's self-efficacy in the solutions phase. CONCLUSIONS: If we recognize that rehabilitation requires patients to adopt new behaviours, becoming aware of psychological techniques that enhance behaviour change could improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - Physical inactivity and chronic back pain are prevalent among older adults; however, there are individuals who persist in exercising despite daily pain. This research explored the meaning of exercise in the lives of older adults with chronic back pain. Hermeneutic phenomenology, valuing everyday experiences and highlighting meaning, was employed. Individual in-depth interviews with 10 adults aged 65 years and older gathered rich descriptions of their experiences. Data collection and analyses were iterative processes. The experience of exercise was inextricably connected with older adults' chronic back pain. The essence of embodied relief from pain offered by exercise was considered through themes reflecting the restoration of existential coherence-enjoying exercise experiences, social engagement, gratitude, learned latitudes, maintaining mobility, and aging. Understanding that older adults can live in their bodies pain-free for some time with regular physical activity may endorse adherence to exercise participation for maintained or improved well-being.

AB  - Low‐back pain can be invalidating physically as well as mentally. Despite professional help to treat and prevent low‐back pain, the pain often persists, and so do the problems related to low‐back pain. An intervention that made it possible for a significant part of patients with low‐back pain to improve health and well‐being raised the question: Why was it possible to help some and not others? The aim of the present paper was to achieve a deeper understanding of factors patients experienced as helpful in professional support related to low‐back pain. This was explored using a hermeneutic‐phenomenological approach while analysing 20 interviews with patients with low‐back pain purposively chosen interviews conducted in relation to the intervention. An analysis was made using Ricoeur's interpretation theory. Data on both positive and negative experiences were read and reflected upon. We found that healthcare professionals' adoption of a narrative approach facilitating the patient's perspective was perceived as helpful. Patients experienced this as being taken seriously; an experience that could be explained at a deeper, more nuanced level using Heidegger's philosophy. Facilitating the patient's perspective was conditional not only on the professional obtaining access to the patient's perspective but also on understanding and acknowledging the patient's existence. The challenge for healthcare professionals in this respect is to bridge the gap between the consultation's fact‐focused concern with the medical implications of low‐back pain and the patient's concern with the implications low‐back pain has for his or her personal identity and life. Listening to the patient's perspective in itself supports the subjective recovery process, while also supporting the quality of patient‐centred support and strengthening the patient's trust in its helpfulness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is one of the major causes of disability world-wide. Most back pain sufferers experience pain that is recurrent or persistent, making management of this condition a priority. In a series of previous studies, chiropractic maintenance care has been found to be an effective way of reducing the number of days with pain, particularly for patients with a certain psychological profile. However, little is known about patients' experience of this kind of management plan. This study aimed to explore patient experiences and preferences by looking at barriers to and facilitators of engaging in and maintaining a care plan, and to contrast the data using psychological sub-groups. METHODS: In this qualitative study we performed semi-structured interviews with 24 patients who had previously participated in a Swedish trial evaluating maintenance care. They were purposefully selected to obtain richness, variation and breadth of data. The data were analyzed using inductive qualitative manifest and latent content analysis. We used the theory of planned behavior to deepen our understanding of the constructed themes. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in two overarching dimensions: "when maintenance care is of high value" and "when maintenance care is of low value". Four factors were jointly identified as obstacles to maintenance care by patients in all the psychological subgroups. These factors were: Cost demanding, A sense of low value, Perceived as unavailable and Fear of treatment. The one factor seen as facilitating maintenance care by patients in all the subgroups was Care that is patient-centered. CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal a variance of both positive and negative experiences of MC in the psychological subgroups. These findings can deepen our understanding of how patients experience MC and can help clinicians to understand when patients might regard maintenance care as being of high value.

AB  - Purpose: This article provides an overview of the biopsychosocial model as it relates to low back pain. The significance of these factors in treatment outcomes and in the clinical assessment of patients with low back pain may be associated with the problems that become chronic. Specific methods of patient education and activation are discussed to help promote optimal outcomes with these patient populations. Method: Qualitative review of literature with synthesis by author for incorporation into chiropractic approaches with chronic low back pain. Summary: Identification of illness behavior through pain assessment instruments, nonorganic clinical findings, and progress monitoring should be incorporated. Any intervention should focus on specific goals aimed at reducing patient anxiety, promoting activity, and increasing patient's ability to be in control of activities of daily living.

AB  - Purpose. This study responded to the need for better theoretical understanding of experiences that shape the beliefs, attitudes and needs of chronic back patients attending pain clinics. The aim was explore and conceptualise the experiences of people of working age who seek help from pain clinics for chronic back pain. Methods. This was a qualitative study, based on an interpretative phenomenological approach (IPA). During in-depth interviews in their homes, participants were invited to 'tell their story' from the time their pain began. Participants were twelve male and six female patients, aged between 28 and 62 years, diagnosed as having chronic benign back pain. All had recently attended one of two pain clinics as new referrals. The interview transcripts were analysed thematically. Findings. Stigmatisation emerged as a key theme from the narrative accounts of participants. The findings expose subtle as well as overt stigmatising responses by family, friends, health professionals and the general public which appeared to have a profound effect on the perceptions, self esteem and behaviours of those interviewed. Conclusions. The findings suggest that patients with chronic back pain feel stigmatised by the time they attend pain clinics and this may affect their attitudes and behaviours towards those offering professional help. Theories of chronic pain need to accommodate these responses, while pain management programmes need to address the realities and practicalities of dealing with stigma in everyday life.

AB  - Low back pain is a considerable health problem which affects people around the world, causing major healthcare costs. The use of qualitative research methods enables us to describe and understand patients' experience of, and attitudes to, healthcare. The aim of the present phenomenographic study was to identify and describe the contextual nature of the conceptions of patients with low back pain of their encounters in the HCS. Seventeen patients with chronic or episodic low back pain classified as "high risk" were interviewed in open recall interviews, using videos of patients' initial physiotherapy sessions that had been recorded previously. The data were analysed using the phenomenographic method. Patients' conceptions of their clinical journey were formulated by a variety of themes: convincing care, lifestyle change, participation, reciprocality and ethicality of encounters. The themes varied in four categories: "non-encounters", seeking support, empowering collaboration and autonomic agency. The results showed a range of clinical interactions - from very negative and disempowering, to empowering and life changing. The key differences between the first and second categories were professionals "being present" and patients starting to understand their low back pain. Between the second and third category, the key aspects were strong therapeutic alliance and the active participation of the patient. Finally, the key differences between the third and fourth categories were the patient being in charge and taking responsibility while knowing that help was available if required. The results may help in improving the care of patients with low back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic back pain has a major physical and psycho-social impact. There have been few subjective assessments of everyday life in relation to migration and ethnicity. Through a descriptive and qualitative cross-cultural design, the aim was to develop an in-depth understanding of how Turkish immigrants experience living with back pain. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study based on interviews with Turkish immigrants suffering from CBP recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic. The analysis was based on Giorgi's phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Eleven Turkish participants with chronic back pain (mean age 47.6) were recruited. Three essences resulted from the analysis: "Overwhelming and prevailing pain" - reflecting pain taking control of everyday life, "Being distressed in community life" - encompassing how pain causes changes in social roles, and "Looking for a way out of pain" - referring to feeling lost when being treated in the healthcare system, finding pain-management strategies and returning to Turkey for assistance. CONCLUSION: Chronic back pain has a significant influence on daily life. Pain changes the feeling of identity relating to close relationships and in the Labor market. Most participants' proficiency in Danish language skills posed a challenge for the existing treatment paradigm, in which information is crucial for successful rehabilitation.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTo improve access to both info on chronic back pain and its treatment, it is crucial that rehabilitation be offered in a range of languages.Proficiency in Danish varies greatly among immigrants, despite years of stay in Denmark. Engaging a professional interpreter early on in the rehabilitation program might improve patient compliance to the preferred treatment regimen. Including a peer-to-peer educational approach in parts of the rehabilitation program might be beneficial, as some immigrants remain skeptical towards the health care system in Denmark.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Previous systematic reviews of patients' experience of health services have used mixed qualitative and quantitative studies. This review focused on qualitative studies, which are more suitable for capturing experience, using modern methods of synthesis of qualitative studies. PURPOSE: To describe the experience of health care of low back pain and sciatica patients and the sources of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with special reference to patients who do not receive a diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of qualitative studies. SAMPLE: Primary qualitative studies identified from Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Psychinfo databases. OUTCOME MEASURES: Conceptual themes of patients' experiences. METHOD: Data collection and analysis were through thematic content analysis. Two reviewers independently screened titles and collected and analyzed data. The authors were in receipt of a Primary Care Research Bursary from National Health Service Suffolk and Norfolk Research Departments, a not-for-profit organization. RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were of high quality. Nine themes emerged: the process and content of care, relationships and interpersonal skills, personalized care, information, the outcome of care, the importance of a diagnosis, delegitimation, recognizing the expert, and service matters. How care was given mattered greatly to patients, with importance given to receiving a perceived full assessment, consideration for the individual's context, good relationships, empathy, and the sharing of information. These aspects of care facilitated the acceptance by some of the limitations of health care and were spread across disciplines. Not having a diagnosis made coping more difficult for some but for others led to delegitimation, a feeling of not being believed. Service matters such as cost and waiting time received little mention. CONCLUSIONS: Although much research into the development of chronic low back pain (LBP) has focused on the patient, this review suggests that research into aspects of care also warrant research. The benefits of generic principles of care, such as personalization and communication, are important to patients with LBP and sciatica; so, practitioners may help their patients by paying as much attention to them as to specific interventions. When neither cure nor a diagnostic label is forthcoming, generic skills remain important for patient satisfaction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines recommend acupuncture as a clinically effective treatment for chronic back pain. However, there is insufficient knowledge of what factors contribute to patients' positive and negative experiences of acupuncture, and how those factors interact in terms of the acceptability of treatment. This study used patient interviews following acupuncture treatment for back pain to identify, understand and describe the elements that contribute or detract from acceptability of treatment. METHODS: The study used semi-structured interviews. Twelve patients were interviewed using an interview schedule as a sub-study nested within a randomised controlled trial of acupuncture for chronic back pain. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Three over-arching themes emerged from the analysis. The first entitled facilitators of acceptability contained five subthemes; experience of pain relief, improvements in physical activity, relaxation, psychological benefit, reduced reliance on medication. The second over-arching theme identified barriers to acceptability, which included needle-related discomfort and temporary worsening of symptoms, pressure to continue treatment and financial cost. The third over-arching theme comprised mediators of acceptability, which included pre-treatment mediators such as expectation and previous experience, and treatment-related mediators of time, therapeutic alliance, lifestyle advice and the patient's active involvement in recovery. These themes inform our understanding of the acceptability of acupuncture to patients with low back pain. CONCLUSION: The acceptability of acupuncture treatment for low back pain is complex and multifaceted. The therapeutic relationship between the practitioner and patient emerged as a strong driver for acceptability, and as a useful vehicle to develop the patients' self-efficacy in pain management in the longer term. Unpleasant treatment related effects do not necessarily detract from patients' overall perception of acceptability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women's pain is still poorly understood. Moreover, maladaptive pain beliefs contribute to the disability associated with low back pain and play a key role in the transition from acute to chronic symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To explore the beliefs of women with non-specific chronic low back pain in terms of nature of symptoms, fears associated with pain, expectations for recovery, family, social and work-related limitations, and perceived self-efficacy. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative study with an interpretative approach was undertaken. Face-to-face, semi-structured individual interviews were performed. Study participants were 10 women with non-specific chronic low back pain living in the Metropolitan Region of Chile. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. A deductive process was used to code the text and categorize the data. RESULTS: Participants described maladaptive beliefs about pain, leading to fearful attitudes and low expectations for recovery. These beliefs seemed to perpetuate pain and limit engagement in daily tasks and meaningful activities. Some of these beliefs were associated with information provided by healthcare professions. Despite having maladaptive beliefs, women perceived themselves as self-effective. CONCLUSION: Women with chronic low back pain described a range of different pain beliefs across a complex categorial structure. The contents of such structure may interfere with their decisions about therapeutic options. Their beliefs were often ungrounded in scientific principles, even if the information may have been provided by healthcare providers. Physical therapists would benefit from these findings to improve communication with their patients and assess the role of beliefs in decision-making.

AB  - Chronic back pain is an under researched area; the complexities of unseen pain in particular, present challenges to the sociological assumptions made about the concept of sickness. The lack of visible signs and symptoms means that some people are left without a diagnosis. If left undiagnosed, their experience of chronic back pain becomes delegitimized and could result in the erosion of self-esteem, self-identity and personhood. Undiagnosed chronic back pain can undermine a persons moral self through disrupting the persons biography and self esteem. Ultimately, people with chronic back pain need person centred approaches to care that support the restoration of the self. The aims of this study were to generate a theory of person-centred care predicated on the experiences of people who have chronic back pain. The research design was influenced by a constructivist paradigm, which underpinned a Grounded Theory methodological approach. A purposive sampling strategy identified 17 people with chronic back pain and 4 multi-professional teams who were involved in their care. Semi-structured interviews with people who have chronic back pain, and the multi-professional teams captured the experience of person-centred care and explicated meaning about its key concepts. Data were analysed using a constant comparative approach through which theoretical sensitivity developed and eleven categories emerged. The conditional partnership became a core category, which formed a substantive theory to explain the experience of person-centred care. The key findings highlight the significance of legitimation on the chronic back pain experience and exposes the impact that delegitimation has on the individuals ability to mobilise resources and manage their pain effectively. This thesis presents the conditional partnership as a theory which explains the relationship needed to support person centred care. The theory suggests that person centred care for people with chronic back pain is underpinned by a conditional partnership which is made up of three conditions; being believed, believing in and non-maleficence which represent the expected conditions of health care and by health care.

AB  - Chronic back pain is globally acknowledged as a common reason why people seek help from health professionals. The complexity of persistent chronic pain can undermine the person's self-esteem and present a number of challenges to an individual's ability to manage their pain. Multi-professional person-centered care is advocated as a key strategy to support people with chronic back pain. However, the impact of these approaches on restoring the person's independence is unclear, and little is known about whether and how person-centered approaches restore autonomy and influence the person's ability to manage their pain. The aim of this grounded theory study was to generate understanding about person-centered care from the perspectives of people with chronic back pain and the multi-professional teams who cared for them. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 17 people with chronic back pain over one year. A constant comparative analytical approach identified five key categories: the skeptical professional, validation, becoming a person, regaining control, and restoring faith. These categories formed the "conditional partnership" as a theory to explain person-centered care, which related to the way in which the partnership developed between the patients and teams. The findings suggest that person-centered care was influenced by the participants' need to be believed and the relationship developed with health care providers. Crucially, these findings suggest that legitimizing the pain experience through person-centered approaches to care can empower people with chronic back pain to regain control of their lives and their pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Positive patient expectations are often believed to be associated with greater benefits from complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments. However, clinical studies of CAM treatments for chronic pain have not consistently supported this assumption, possibly because of differences in definitions and measures of expectations. The goal of this qualitative paper is to provide new perspectives on the outcome expectations of patients prior to receiving CAM therapies for chronic low back pain. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 64 individuals receiving massage, chiropractic, acupuncture or yoga for chronic low back pain. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed by a team of experienced qualitative researchers using an immersion/crystallization approach to coding and analysis. RESULTS: Overall, participants' expectations of treatment outcomes tended to cluster in four key domains: pain relief, improved function (including an increase in ability to engage in meaningful activities), improved physical fitness, and improved overall well-being (including mental well-being). Typically, patients had modest expectations for outcomes from treatment. Furthermore, outcome expectations were complex on several levels. First, the concept of expectations overlapped with several related concepts; in particular, hopes. Participants sometimes used expectations and hopes interchangeably and at other times made clear distinctions between these two terms depending on context. A related finding was that participants were cautious about stating that they expected positive outcomes. Finally, participants articulated strong interrelationships among the four key domains and often discussed how changes in one domain might affect other domains. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings contribute to a growing body of literature exploring the role of expectations in patient outcomes. This paper provides important guidance that may help refine the way treatment expectations are studied in the future. In particular, participants' statements indicate that standardized measures of patient expectations should include items that capture hesitancy to articulate overly optimistic outcomes as well as interrelationships among different outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to gain insight into how low back pain (LBP) patients conceptualize the construct of expectations regarding treatment. METHODS: This study was nested within a mixed-method randomized clinical trial comparing three primary care interventions for LBP. A total of 77 participants with LBP lasting longer than 6 weeks were included; semi-structured interviews were conducted querying patients about their expectations for treatment. Also factors influencing their expectations were explored. Interviews were administered following enrollment into the study, but prior to study treatment. Two researchers independently conducted a content analysis using NVIVO 9 software. RESULTS: LBP patients' expectations could be categorized in two main domains: outcome and process expectations, each with subdomains. Patients expressed expectations in all subdomains both as values (what they hoped) and probabilities (what they thought was likely). In multiple subdomains, there were differences in the nature (positive vs. negative) and frequency of value and probability expectations. Participants reported that multiple factors influenced their expectations of which past experience with treatment appeared to be of major influence on probability expectations. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: This study showed that LBP patients' expectations for treatment are multifaceted. Current measurement instruments do not cover all domains and subdomains of expectations. Therefore, we recommend the development of new or improved measures that make a distinction between value and probability expectations and assess process and/or outcome expectations covering multiple subdomains. Some of the influencing factors found in this study may be useful targets for altering patients' treatment expectations and improving health outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study explored the experiences of people living with non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP) in a rural Nigerian community. METHOD: Qualitative in-depth semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with purposively sampled participants until data saturation. Questions explored back pain beliefs, coping/management strategies and daily activities. Thematic analysis of transcripts was performed using the Framework approach. RESULTS: Themes showed that back pain beliefs were related to manual labour/deprivation, infection/degeneration, spiritual/cultural beliefs and rural-urban divide. These beliefs impacted on gender roles resulting in adaptive or maladaptive coping. Adaptive coping was facilitated by positive beliefs, such as not regarding CLBP as an illness, whereas viewing CLBP as illness stimulated maladaptive coping strategies. Spirituality was associated with both adaptive and maladaptive coping. Maladaptive coping strategies led to dissatisfaction with health care in this community. CONCLUSIONS: CLBP-related disability in rural Nigeria is strongly influenced by beliefs that facilitate coping strategies that either enhance or inhibit recovery. Interventions should therefore target maladaptive beliefs while emphasizing behavioural modification. Implications for Rehabilitation Non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP) is highly prevalent and responsible for much pain and disability in rural Nigeria. No qualitative study has investigated the experiences of people living with CLBP in rural Nigeria or any other rural African context. Qualitative study of peoples' experiences of living with CLBP in rural Nigeria has the potential of exposing complex socio-cultural and psychological factors associated with CLBP which has potential implications for designing effective interventions. The results of this study may inform the development of complex interventions for reducing the disability associated with CLBP in rural Nigeria and other rural African contexts.

AB  - A small pragmatic non-randomised controlled study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of a novel theory-informed community-based self-management programme targeting the biopsychosocial factors associated with chronic low back pain disability in a rural Nigerian primary care centre. Participants either received the programme, once weekly for 6 weeks, or usual care. The programme combined group exercise sessions with group/individual discussion sessions, informed by cognitive behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing. Recruitment rate, intervention delivery, proportion of planned treatment attended, retention/dropout rate, adherence to recommended self-management strategies and biopsychosocial outcomes were used to determine feasibility. Structured qualitative exit feedback interviews ascertained acceptability. Recruitment rate was 100%, treatment uptake was 83% and loss to follow-up was 8%. Greater benefits for the self-management group compared with control were observed for primary and secondary biopsychosocial outcomes. Although the programme appears promising, the exploratory design of this study warrants more rigorous intervention testing following suggested programme improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rural Nigeria has one of the greatest burdens of low back pain but there are no effective evidence-based interventions to manage it in this population. This paper presents the application of the intervention mapping (IM) approach in the development of a complex behavior change intervention - The Good Back program, aimed at reducing non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP) disability in rural Nigeria. METHODS: The first four steps of IM were applied. A critical review of the literature, 2 qualitative studies and a population-based cross-sectional study in rural Nigeria helped to identify two key program objectives in order to reduce CLBP disability in this population: reduce the impact of illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs, catastrophising, anxiety and depression by targeting maladaptive illness perceptions about CLBP; and facilitate the adoption of exercises and good posture to limit disability. A systematic review plus these studies, identified the personal and environmental determinants of the performance objectives including health literacy, self-awareness, self-efficacy, personal preference, health professional skills, health facility structure and family/community support. The theory, techniques and strategies for modifying personal and environmental determinants were also identified from these studies. Intervention components and materials were then produced for practical application. The initial developed intervention was described. RESULTS: The feasibility and acceptability of the developed program was then tested using a small pragmatic non-randomised controlled study incorporating qualitative exit feedback interviews in a rural Nigerian primary health care centre. The program appeared feasible and acceptable when delivered by a highly trained physiotherapist. There were promising clinical outcomes in disability, pain intensity, illness perceptions, fear avoidance beliefs and pain medication use. Suggestions for program improvement included shorter but ongoing sessions, video demonstration of exercises/good posture, spacious exercise/demonstration rooms, and community legitimisation of exercise as treatment for back pain. Subsequent modifications to program content and delivery were then described. Theoretical modification included the addition of aspects of the social cognitive theory to the Leventhal's self-regulatory model of illness cognitions. CONCLUSIONS: IM appears to be a suitable framework for designing complex behavior change interventions in rural Nigeria. The need for further testing of the intervention was highlighted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low recovery expectations have been identified as a strong and consistent predictor of poor outcome in non-chronic non-specific low back pain (NSLBP). The aim of this study was to explore how people determine their own recovery expectation during an episode of non-chronic NSLBP. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of people with non-chronic NSLBP and low recovery expectations. Interviews were audio--recorded and transcribed verbatim. Two researchers independently applied open coding, followed by axial coding to allow themes to emerge from the data using a constant comparison method. RESULTS: The central theme of the person and 4 subthemes of pain, progress, performance, and treatment emerged from the data. The formation of recovery expectations was dependent on the person's unique apprasial of their pain, how the condition had progressed, the limitation of their performance of activities, and the impact of different aspects of treatment. CONCLUSION: Recovery expectation is a person's appraisal of several factors to determine when they are likely to return to their usual activities during an episode of non-chronic NSLBP. Health professionals should explore the person's perception of these factors as part of a tailored intervention to prevent non-chronic NSLBP progressing to chronic NSLBP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A health coaching intervention in addition to usual physiotherapy care increased recovery expectation and activity in people with non-chronic NSLBP and low recovery expectation. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to fully describe the coaching intervention to allow replication and enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind health coaching in this setting. METHODS: A qualitative analysis was conducted using notes taken by the coach during the health coaching intervention. Two researchers independently applied open coding and content analysis, using the factors of low recovery expectation identified in a previous qualitative investigation as a framework. RESULTS: For the majority of participants coaching rapidly progressed to goal setting and action planning, with less time spent on increasing the importance and confidence to return to activity. The factors of the person, progression, pain, performance and treatment were addressed across all phases of the coaching intervention. CONCLUSION: This effective health coaching intervention for people with non-chronic NSLBP and low recovery expectation concentrated on goal setting and action planning and addressed the essential factors of recovery expectations. This study suggests that coaching interventions are likely to be different in this population compared to similar interventions in chronic conditions due to pre-existing levels of readiness to change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is a complex condition that is physically and psychologically debilitating, with vulnerable populations experiencing more severe outcomes. Physical therapy (PT) includes evidence-based treatments that can reduce disability, however the experience of PT can vary amongst different populations. Empirical evidence is largely based on majority samples that are predominantly white with high educational attainment. Little is known regarding how people from vulnerable groups (e.g. low income and racial minority) experience physical therapy treatment for low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To describe the experience of physical therapy in a predominantly low-income and minority population with cLBP. METHODS: This qualitative study was embedded within a randomized controlled trial for patients with cLBP in urban, underserved communities. We used a convenience sample to interview 12 participants from the 102 who participated in the PT arm of the trial and then performed thematic analysis to describe their experience. RESULTS: Three major themes emerged: 1) Empowerment through education and exercise; 2) Interconnectedness to providers and other patients; and 3) Improvements in pain, body mechanics, and mood. Divergent cases were few however centered around a lack of improvement in pain or an absence of connection with the therapist. Within the first theme a prevailing sub-theme emerged that aligned with Bandura's theory of self-efficacy: 1) Mastery of experience; 2) Verbal persuasion; 3) Vicarious experience; and 4) Physiological state. CONCLUSIONS: Our participants' insight highlighted the value of cognitive-emotional and interpersonal dimensions of PT. These may be particularly important components of PT in populations that have experienced systemic distrust in providers and disparities in services. Future work could use Bandura's model of self-efficacy to build a PT intervention comprised of fear-based movement exercises, interconnectedness, a strong therapeutic alliance, and mindfulness techniques.

AB  - <b>Introduction:</b> Chronic pain and the current opioid epidemic are pressing public health concerns, especially in low-income and ethnically diverse communities. Nonpharmacologic therapies that are safe, effective, and acceptable for the treatment of chronic pain conditions may provide a solution for addressing this issue. This qualitative analysis explores the experience of study participants who received combined acupuncture and yoga therapy (YT) to treat chronic pain delivered in a primary care setting. <b>Methods:</b> The group acupuncture with yoga therapy for chronic neck, low back, and osteoarthritic pain trial (GAPYOGA) assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of group acupuncture (GA) combined with YT in a low-income, racial, and ethnically diverse population. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with a subset of patients in the trial. Nineteen participants were interviewed for qualitative analysis of their experience. Using the immersion and crystallization method, transcribed interviews were analyzed for themes meaningfully representing participant experience. <b>Results:</b> The combined GA and YT resulted in significant pain relief and transformative healing experiences. Three themes emerged from participant narratives: (1) transformative engagement with self in the healing process through pain relief, psychological well-being, and self-efficacy; (2) therapeutic relationship with acupuncture and yoga providers; and (3) fostering relationships with fellow participants in the group. <b>Discussion:</b> In this study of a low-income and ethnically diverse population, the combination of acupuncture and YT was found to alleviate pain, improve function, promote psychological well-being, and engage participants in self-care practices in a transformative healing process-resulting in physical and psychological benefits.

AB  - Developing a greater understanding of the social and environmental factors that are related to differential outcomes for individuals who experience persistent pain and disability is important for achieving health equity. In this study, we aimed to develop insights into the role of the social determinants of health (SDH) in care experiences and health status for socio-economically disadvantaged adults who experience persistent low back pain or persistent pain following spinal cord injury. Our objectives were to investigate (i) relationships between the SDH and health outcomes, (ii) care experiences and (iii) perceived barriers and facilitators to optimal pain care. We conducted a mixed-methods convergent parallel study involving an online survey and semi-structured interviews. We analysed the data from each method separately and integrated the findings. One-hundred sixty-four adults completed the survey and 17 adults completed the semi-structured interviews. We found large or moderate-sized correlations between greater self-reported social isolation and poorer health outcomes. Experiencing a higher number of adverse SDH was moderately correlated with lower quality of life and was significantly correlated with all other outcomes. We generated 5 themes from the qualitative analysis: active strategies are important for well-being; low agency; facilitators of optimal care; barriers to optimal care; and health inequities, and derived meta-inferences that highlight the complex inter-relationships between the SDH and health outcomes in this cohort. The findings of our study can importantly inform endeavours to improve equity of pain care for adults with low back pain or spinal cord injury and persistent pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders affect all racial and ethnic groups, including Hispanics. Because these disorders are not life-threatening, decision-making is generally preference-based. Little is known about whether Hispanics in the U.S. differ from non-Hispanic Whites with respect to key decision making preferences. METHODS: We assembled six focus groups of Hispanic and non-Hispanic White patients with chronic back or knee pain at an urban medical center to discuss management of their conditions and the roles they preferred in medical decision-making. Hispanic groups were further stratified by socioeconomic status, using neighborhood characteristics as proxy measures. Discussions were led by a moderator, taped, transcribed and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. RESULTS: The analysis revealed ethnic differences in several areas pertinent to medical decision-making. Specifically, Hispanic participants were more likely to permit their physician to take the predominant role in making health decisions. Also, Hispanics of lower socioeconomic status generally preferred to use non-internet sources of health information to make medical decisions and to rely on advice obtained by word of mouth. Hispanics emphasized the role of faith and religion in coping with musculoskeletal disability. The analysis also revealed broad areas of concordance across ethnic strata including the primary role that pain and achieving pain relief play in patients' experiences and decisions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest differences between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites in preferred information sources and decision-making roles. These findings are hypothesis-generating. If confirmed in further research, they may inform the development of interventions to enhance preference-based decision-making among Hispanics.

AB  - Chronic low back pain is the most commonly reported chronic pain condition, with an exceedingly high prevalence. The economic burden to society is remarkable with ensuing functional disablement. Although self-management (SM) and self-management support (SMS) are now being recommended to address chronic low back pain, there is a paucity of research on SM, SMS, and functional ability in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to describe the perceptions of chronic low back pain patients on their self-management (SM), self-management support (SMS), and functional ability. This qualitative manuscript is part of the data derived from a larger study using a non-experimental, cross-sectional, descriptive design. Open-ended questions on SM, SMS, and functional ability resulted in an abundant amount of substantive information. Participant responses provided significant themes. Taking medications and maintaining physical activity were dominant SM activities. Major participant-perceived SMS activities were prescribing medications, providing other treatments, and giving encouragement. Participants ' concerns regarding their functional ability centered on anxiety and fear. This study can facilitate improved understanding on the SM, SMS, and functional ability of patients with chronic low back pain. There is an increased need for education and support of patients' mental state to facilitate SM. It is equally important for health care professionals to be proficient in providing SMS. These findings provide essential foundation toward evaluating the impact of SM and SMS on functional ability and other chronic low back pain outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional Restorative Programmes (FRP) for persistent non-specific lower back pain have been shown to be effective, but they often lack sufficient detailed reporting of the intervention components to allow for accurate replication. OBJECTIVES: This study used the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy (v1) (BCTi) <sup>[1]</sup> to identify the main components of one such programme and interviewed patients to identify the most effective programme components and areas for improvement. DESIGN: A mixed methods design was used. METHODS: Intervention data were coded using the BCT Taxonomy (v1) to identify the BCTs utilised. Following this, semi-structured interviews with nine patients evaluated the BCTs included using thematic analysis and identified possible techniques for inclusion in future developments of the programme. RESULTS: Forty-one different BCTs were identified in the coding phase with frequency of occurrence in the programme ranging from forty-nine to one. Four main themes emerged from the interviews: Social Support, Shaping Knowledge, Repetition and Substitution and Changes in Mindset. CONCLUSION: The results of this study identify the key ingredients in a programme for persistent, non-specific lower back pain, which facilitates the replication of this intervention and identified areas patients appreciated most as well as areas for improvement.

AB  - Pain neurophysiology education (PNE) is an educational intervention for patients with chronic pain. PNE purports to assist patients to reconceptualise their pain away from the biomedical model towards a more biopsychosocial understanding by explaining pain biology. This study aimed to explore the extent, and nature, of patients' reconceptualisation of their chronic low back pain (CLBP) following PNE. Eleven adults with CLBP underwent semistructured interviews before and three weeks after receiving PNE. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed in a framework approach using four a priori themes identified from our previous research: (1) degrees of reconceptualisation, (2) personal relevance, (3) importance of prior beliefs, and (4) perceived benefit of PNE. We observed varying degrees of reconceptualisation from zero to almost complete, with most participants showing partial reconceptualisation. Personal relevance of the information to participants and their prior beliefs were associated with the degree of benefit they perceived from PNE. Where benefits were found, they manifested as improved understanding, coping, and function. Findings map closely to our previous studies in more disparate chronic pain groups. The phenomenon of reconceptualisation is applicable to CLBP and the sufficiency of the themes from our previous studies increases confidence in the certainty of the findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Back pain is an increasingly prevalent health concern amongst Australian women for which a wide range of treatment options are available, offered by biomedical, allied health and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers. Although there is an emerging literature on patterns of provider utilisation, less is known about the reasons why women with back pain select their chosen practitioner. In this paper we explore the influences on back pain sufferers' decision-making about treatment seeking with practitioners for their most recent episode of back pain. METHODS: Drawing on 50 semi-structured interviews with women aged 60-65 years from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) who have chronic back pain, we focus on the factors which influence their choice of practitioner. Analysis followed a framework approach to qualitative content analysis, augmented by NVivo 9 qualitative data analysis software. Key themes were identified and tested for rigour through inter-rater reliability and constant comparison. RESULTS: The women identified four predominant influences on their choice of practitioner for back pain: familiarity with treatment or experiences with individual practitioners; recommendations from social networks; geographical proximity of practitioners; and, qualifications and credentials of practitioners. The therapeutic approach or evidence-base of the practices being utilised was not reported by the women as central to their back pain treatment decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of practitioner appears to be unrelated to the therapeutic approaches, treatment practices or the scientific basis of therapeutic practices. Moreover, anecdotal lay reports of effectiveness and the 'treatment experience' may be more influential than formal qualifications in guiding women's choice of practitioner for their back pain. Further work is needed on the interpersonal, collective and subjective underpinnings of practitioner choice, particularly over time, in order to better understand why women utilise certain practitioners for back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the experience of patients from a low-income, ethnically diverse medically underserved population receiving acupuncture for chronic pain. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis using inductive thematic analysis of interviews with participants from an acupuncture trial. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Four community health centers in the Bronx, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven adults with chronic neck or back pain or osteoarthritis who participated in a previous acupuncture trial. INTERVENTIONS: Up to 14 weekly acupuncture treatments. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain and quality of life were examined in the original trial; this study examines qualitative outcomes. RESULTS: The themes grouped naturally into three domains of the acupuncture experience: the decision-making process, the treatment experience, and the effect of acupuncture on health. Regarding decision-making, important factors were a willingness to try something new even if you do not necessarily "believe" in it or have specifically positive expectations; a sense that medications were not working for their pain, that they also caused significant adverse effects, and that natural strategies might be preferable; and a feeling of desperation. Cost and access were significant barriers to acupuncture treatment. Regarding the process of acupuncture, the open and personal communication with the acupuncturist was an important factor, as were the sense that the process of acupuncture related to a natural process of healing or correction within the body and that part of making acupuncture successful required being open to the power of the mind to generate a positive outcome. Regarding the effect of treatment, notable aspects were the deep sense of rest and relaxation participants reported during treatment as well as the benefit they experienced for conditions other than pain. CONCLUSIONS: The themes that emerged in this ethnically diverse, low-income population were very similar to those that have emerged over the past decade of qualitative research on the acupuncture experience in other patient populations.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to use concept mapping, a methodological approach combining qualitative and quantitative strategies, to identify and categorize the beliefs held by chronic low back pain sufferers. Eighty-three belief statements were identified. A concept map was generated consisting of seven themes: denial/regret, self-defeating/passive, medications/pain focus, cautious realism, accepting limitations, adaptive coping, and responsibility for rehabilitation. Categorization of the beliefs revealed that the concepts and representative statements were not completely reducible to theoretical formulations previously used to examine the association between beliefs and coping with chronic pain. The concept map can be interpreted to suggest a model that asserts individuals hold different beliefs along the way to being rehabilitated. The results of this study highlight the need for future research to validate the themes identified and examine the extent to which beliefs change throughout the rehabilitation process.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Backgroundand aim: The long-term success of rehabilitation in chronic low back pain is not yet established. The present study examined promoting factors, barriers and barrier management of health-promoting behavior among rehabilitative patients. METHOD: In total, 35 documents of patients of 4 inpatient behavioral medicine orthopedic rehabilitation clinics were included into the analysis of a written survey based on 3 open questions. The free-worded statements were electronically recorded and then analyzed by content analysis. RESULTS: Promoting factors of patients for the implementation of healthy life style behaviors included the learning of techniques for pain and stress management as well as increased volition and quality of life. Among patients with increased depressive symptoms, insufficient volition, family and professional pressures were identified as barriers. Finally, social support was reported to facilitate implementing health-promoting behavior into daily life. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the long-term rehabilitation success can be improved by treating exercises to implement health-promoting behavior into daily life, applying individualized barrier management, and offering post-rehabilitative treatments in all communities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent pain is highly prevalent in older adults and can lead to functional limitations in activities of daily living, and to psychosocial distress. There is a lack of established active therapy programs, especially for older adults with chronic pain. OBJECTIVES: To develop a graded activity program and to evaluate its feasibility within a pilot study. DESIGN: Phase I/phase II trial of a complex intervention. A mixed methods design was chosen to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary evidence of effectiveness. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Several experts participated in the program development. Sixteen community-dwelling older adults (73.9 +/- 5.9 years on average) with chronic low back pain and three primary care physical therapists attempted the program. METHODS: Guided semi-structured interviews were conducted with all patients and therapists and used a content-analytic approach. Measurements of self-rated functional status (HFAQ), average pain (NRS), falls self-efficacy (FES-I), and catastrophizing and avoidance beliefs (CAS-D 65+) were applied at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: The interviews revealed high acceptance, satisfaction, and practicality. Besides improvements in function and pain, patients mentioned more positive attitudes towards pain, activity, and self-confidence. There was a clinically relevant increase in physical function by 20.3%, a decrease in pain intensity, and a reduction in catastrophizing and avoidance behavior. CONCLUSION: This graded activity program demonstrated feasibility and high acceptance in aged individuals and therapists. Future studies with larger samples must confirm effectiveness. The principles also appear applicable to other chronic pain conditions. The program could easily be implemented in routine primary care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify core elements of what patients with chronic low back pain perceive as good clinical communication and interaction with a specialist ("The Good Back-Consultation"). DESIGN: Qualitative study including observation of consultations and a subsequent patient interview. Quantitative data were also recorded. SUBJECTS: Thirty-five patients with chronic low back pain referred to a specialist. METHODS: Thirty-five consultations were observed with respect to history-taking, clinical examination and interaction between patient and doctor. Patients were subsequently interviewed about how they perceived the consultation. Fourteen specialists with various specialty branches and 35 patients (18 males) participated. For 3 of the specialists a positive effect (return to work) on patients with chronic low back pain had been documented in previous randomized controlled trials. Qualitative data analysis was performed using a template method. RESULTS: Most patients thought that the history-taking and clinical examination had been thorough and satisfactory. Patients emphasized the importance of being given an explanation during the examination of what was being done and found, of receiving understandable information on the causes of the pain, of receiving reassurance, discussing psychosocial issues and discussing what can be done. The most important characteristic of "The Good Back-Consultation" was that the specialist took the patient seriously. CONCLUSION: The findings may represent an important potential for enhancing clinical communication with patients.

AB  - QUESTION: What are the experiences of adults with chronic, benign, low back pain as they seek help and support from healthcare, social, and legal systems? Design: Phenomenology. Setting: 2 pain clinics in southern UK. Patients: 20 consecutive adults (age range 28-80 y, 60% men, duration of low back pain 2-50 y) with chronic, benign, low back pain who had recently started to come to the pain clinic. Methods: Adults were interviewed for 1.5-3 hours in their homes by 1 of 2 investigators. The adults were asked to tell their stories (lived experiences) from inception of the pain. Probing, non-directive questions were used to elicit their feelings and thoughts about experiences and situations related to their pain. Issues related to healthcare, social, and legal services were explored if they emerged spontaneously. Audio tapes were transcribed and themes were developed, which were then validated by another researcher. Main findings: 5 sequential themes were identified: the pain takes over, sense of loss in the system, they don't understand, and coming to terms. Adults felt that their lives had been irrevocably changed because of the pain and had a profound sense of loss that pervaded all aspects of their daily lives. They felt trapped within various systems and felt misunderstood and stigmatised, especially when obvious pathology to confirm their suffering was absent. These experiences made it difficult to come to terms with their situation. Being in the system assumed a central part of the adults' lives. Initially, all received prolonged periods of bed rest with drugs and other treatments. The next step in the process included long periods of waiting for referrals, investigations and their results, appointments, surgery, and pain clinics. Feelings of frustration alternating with hope were common. None of the participants was satisfied with the medical process. Communication was poor and little coordination or continuity of care occurred. Participants wanted to know why they had pain and why treatments did not appear to be effective. The expectations of identifying the causes of the back pain and implementation of effective treatments were not met, and the adults lost faith in the ability and interest of their caregivers. Participants also feared that the pain was 'in their minds.' Most participants lost their jobs and had to fight to make a legitimate claim for benefits and compensation that was recognised by the system. During the whole process, participants felt frustrated in that they were rendered passive, powerless, and trapped. Participants became frustrated by systems that were designed originally to provide help and protection. Conclusion: During the process of seeking diagnosis and treatment, adults with chronic, benign, low back pain experienced frustration and felt that they were rendered passive, powerless, and entrapped by healthcare, social, and legal systems that were initially designed to provide help and protection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedentary time (SED) is associated with many detrimental health outcomes, yet little is known about what factors influence one's ability to reduce SED. Even less is known about these factors in specific patient populations for whom high levels of SED may influence symptoms, such as those with chronic low back pain (cLBP). The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore participants' perceptions of factors that influenced their ability to reduce SED across an 8-week intervention to reduce SED in adults with cLBP and elevated depressive symptoms. METHODS: Three months after a theory-based intervention to break up and reduce sitting, semi-structured interviews explored factors that influenced reducing SED. Three researchers independently coded each conversation. Codes were charted and mapped with participants reviewing their own transcripts and the merged codes. The research team then defined key themes. Factors that were perceived to either facilitate behavior change or acted as barriers were identified and thematized as positive or negative determinants. RESULTS: Common barriers for reducing SED included environmental constraints, opposing social norms, and productivity; these barriers were frequently encountered in the workplace. Common facilitators for reducing SED included habit development, self-monitoring tools, restructuring the physical environment, and social accountability. Notably, back pain was not a frequently reported barrier or facilitator for reducing SED. CONCLUSION: This sample of patients with cLBP and elevated depressive symptoms had similar determinants for reducing SED as previously reported in non-patient populations and did not appear to need strategies specific to dealing with chronic pain. Since work-related social norms and environmental factors were perceived as significant barriers to sitting less, workplace interventions that provide standing desks, offer standing meetings rooms, and/or institution-wide standing breaks may help reduce SED at work. The use of an activity monitor with sitting reminders and education regarding how to use the reminders as external cues to develop new sitting habits may also aid in adoption and adherence to this behavior change across settings. Developing coping plans and restructuring physical environments were perceived as successful strategies for overcoming social and environmental barriers. Future interventions targeting SED reductions may benefit from incorporating these strategies.

AB  - <b>Objective:</b> To determine the perceived benefits of t'ai chi in older adults with chronic low-back pain (cLBP). <b>Design:</b> A qualitative analysis from a randomized controlled feasibility trial. <b>Subjects:</b> Eighteen participants (65+ years old) with cLBP of at least moderate intensity. <b>Intervention:</b> A 36-week intervention beginning with twice weekly classes for 12 weeks, weekly classes for 6 weeks, biweekly classes for 6 weeks, and monthly classes for 12 weeks. Participants were asked to practice at home on nonclass days and videos were provided to assist in that process. <b>Outcome Measures:</b> Participants in the focus groups were asked to provide feedback on their experiences with the study as well as the benefits of their t'ai chi practice. We used demographic and class attendance data to describe the sample. <b>Results:</b> Regarding the benefits of t'ai chi practice, five major themes were identified: functional benefits, pain reduction/pain relief, psychospiritual benefits, the importance of social support in learning t'ai chi, and the integration of t'ai chi into daily activities. The most common functional benefits were improvements in balance, flexibility, leg strength, and posture. Some reported pain reduction or pain relief, but others did not. Increased relaxation, mindfulness, and a sense of connectedness were subthemes that emerged from psychospiritual benefits. Social support benefits included motivation to attend class and group support while learning a new skill. Finally, improved body awareness allowed participants to integrate t'ai chi skills into their daily activities. <b>Conclusions:</b> This qualitative analysis demonstrates the multifaceted benefits of t'ai chi for older adults living with cLBP.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Fear-avoidance beliefs in older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP) can lead to disability. Graded exposure-based active physical therapy could be an option to enhance physical ability in older patients with CLBP. The purpose of this study was to develop a standardized graded exposure treatment according to the fear-avoidance model of musculo-skeletal pain for older patients with CLBP and to examine its effectiveness and feasibility in the German health care system. Methods: The study represents a phase I/phase II trial of a complex intervention. Taking a first step into the hierarchy of growing empirical evidence, a prospective 1-factor observational study was conducted with repeated measurements 1 week before and within 2 weeks after the intervention. Three physical therapists, who completed an introductory workshop, provided the treatment in the form of individual therapies. Sixteen participants 65 years or older with CLBP and perceived physical limitations were recruited. Four patient-reported outcome measures and semistructured interviews were conducted. The primary outcome was physical ability measured with the Hanover Functional Ability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were the numerical pain rating scale, and an age-specific and adapted 11-item short-form of the Patient Anxiety Symptom Scale, the KVS-D 65 +, which quantified catastro-phizing and avoidance beliefs. Fear of falling was measured with the Falls Efficacy Scale-International. For the analysis, Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples and an a level of .05 were chosen. For the qualitative evaluation, semistruc-tured interviews were conducted with the patients and physical therapists explored indicators of feasibility such as demands, acceptability, satisfaction, adaptation needs, and implementation. For content analysis, codes were primarily derived deductively and complemented by inductively derived new themes. Results: A significant increase in physical ability after the treatment was observed with an effect size (ES) of 0.95 (P = .008). With regard to secondary outcomes, there was a statistically significant decrease in pain intensity (P = .029) and a reduction in catastrophizing (ES = 0.91; P = .021) and avoidance beliefs (ES = 1.37; P = .001). The interviews revealed good acceptance and satisfaction of the treatment by the patients and physical therapists. Conclusion: On the whole, the treatment appears effective and feasible. Apart from the benefits achieved by the participants, the study provides a basis for designing future studies at a higher level of evidence.

AB  - Purpose. To explore the experiences, opinions and treatment expectations of chronic low back pain (LBP) patients in order to identify what components of treatment they consider as being of most value. Method. Three stand-alone focus groups were convened. All participants were experiencing chronic non-specific LBP (>3 months). Each group was facilitated by an independent moderator, and guided by a series of pre-determined questions. Participants were encouraged to freely air their personal opinions during the discussion. Transcribed data were organized into a series of 'categories' using the Qualitative Solutions for Researchers Nudist 6 package from which five common themes emerged. Results. Each participant had typically experienced a variety of failed treatment approaches. Whilst the value of advice and exercise was recognized, participants typically questioned the appropriateness of such treatment given the fact that a precise diagnosis was rarely given, and symptoms often recurred. As a result, poor adherence with advice and exercise appeared to be a key factor limiting the potential effectiveness of long-term self-management strategies. Conclusions. Participants considered appropriate exercise (despite pain) and activity modification as important components for effective long-term self-management of symptoms. To enhance treatment effectiveness, participants welcomed the introduction of individually tailored advice and exercise programmes, with supervision and follow-up support, along with a better understanding of the physical and emotional impact of chronic LBP by practitioners.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical experience of manual therapy for musculoskeletal pain is that patients often suffer from recurrent pain and disorders, but that they do not continue to perform their physical home exercises when they are free from symptoms. The chance of positive long-term effects of manual therapy would probably increase if patients were reminded that they are to continue to perform their exercises. Mobile phone text messaging (short messaging service, SMS) is increasingly used as an innovative intervention to remind patient to exercise. However, there are only a few studies on such interventions in the field of low back pain (LBP). Qualitative studies of patients' experiences of receiving text messages as reminders of home exercises after manual treatment for recurrent LBP have to the best of our knowledge never been published. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore older persons' common experiences of receiving reminders of home exercises through mobile phone text messaging after specialized manual therapy for recurrent LBP. METHODS: A total of 7 men and 8 women (67-86 years), who had sought specialized manual therapy (Naprapathic manual therapy) for recurrent LBP were included in the study. Individual one-way text messages as reminders of home exercises (to be performed on a daily basis) were sent to each patient every third day for 3 weeks, then once a week for another 2 weeks. Semistructured interviews with 2 broad, open-ended questions were held and data were analyzed with systematic text condensation, based on Giorgi's principles of psychological phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: The participants appreciated the messages, which were perceived as timely and usable, and also stimulated memorizing. The messages made the participants reflect on the aim of the exercise, value of being reminded, and on their improvement in pain. During the interviews, the participants created their own routines for continued adherence to the exercises. CONCLUSIONS: It seems plausible that mobile phone text messaging may serve as a useful tool for patient empowerment with regard to recurrent LBP in older persons. Further studies are needed to explore whether future compliance with the exercises will be as large if the participants are not being interviewed.

AB  - In this paper I consider 30 Finnish women's written narratives about the process of getting back pain diagnosed. From the beginning of the early discomfort of back pain, the women were sure of its bodily and subjective reality. They struggled repeatedly to be taken seriously, and only after years of medical disparagement did they encounter medical professionals who were able solve the riddle and give it a name, a diagnosis. Since back pain is a baffling problem and challenges the central biomedical epistemology-objective knowledge and measurable findings separate from subjective experience-it allowed the doctors to show a disrespectful attitude toward back pain sufferers. The moral essence of the women's common story was the stigmatizing experience when doctors did not take subjective pain seriously. Instead, doctors' neglectful attitudes became part of the prolonged problem. During the long-lasting uncertainty, women tried multiple coping strategies to ease their lives and developed mental attitudes to endure the pain. Since the protagonists did not give up the lived certainty of back pain they were gradually able to challenge medical uncertainty and to demand a thorough medical examination, and/or through random circumstance they encountered doctors who were willing to take their symptoms seriously. This triggered turning points that immediately or very soon resulted in solving the riddle of the puzzling pain. To be finally diagnosed was a great relief. However, to be taken seriously as a person was considered to be the greatest relief.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the low back pain beliefs of Aboriginal Australians; a population previously identified as protected against the disabling effects of low back pain due to cultural beliefs. DESIGN: Qualitative study employing culturally appropriate methods within a clinical ethnographic framework. SETTING: One rural and two remote towns in Western Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two Aboriginal people with chronic low-back pain (CLBP; 21 men, 11 women). Participants included those who were highly, moderately and mildly disabled. RESULTS: Most participants held biomedical beliefs about the cause of CLBP, attributing pain to structural/anatomical vulnerability of their spine. This belief was attributed to the advice from healthcare practitioners and the results of spinal radiological imaging. Negative causal beliefs and a pessimistic future outlook were more common among those who were more disabled. Conversely, those who were less disabled held more positive beliefs that did not originate from interactions with healthcare practitioners. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are consistent with research in other populations and support that disabling CLBP may be at least partly iatrogenic. This raises concerns for all populations exposed to Western biomedical approaches to examination and management of low back pain. The challenge for healthcare practitioners dealing with people with low back pain from any culture is to communicate in a way that builds positive beliefs about low back pain and its future consequences, enhancing resilience to disability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a complex issue to manage in primary care and under-researched in Aboriginal populations. Good communication between practitioners and patients is essential but difficult to achieve. This study examined communication from the perspective of Aboriginal people with CLBP in regional and remote Western Australia. METHODS: Qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 adults with CLBP who identify as Aboriginal. The approach and analysis were informed by clinical ethnography and cultural security. RESULTS: Barriers to communication related to communication content, information that was not evidence-based, miscommunications, communicative absence and the use of medical jargon. Enablers related to communication style described as 'yarning', a two-way dialogue, and healthcare practitioners with good listening and conversational skills. DISCUSSION: Health practitioners need to consider communication content and style to improve interactions with Aboriginal people with CLBP. A 'yarning' style may be a useful framework. Findings may be pertinent to other populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients receiving lumbar spinal fusion surgery often have persisting postoperative pain negatively affecting their daily life. These patients may be helped by interdisciplinary cognitive-behavioral therapy which is recognized as an effective intervention for improving beneficial pain coping behavior, thereby facilitating the rehabilitation process of patients with chronic pain. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe the lived experience of patients recovering from lumbar spinal fusion surgery and to explore potential similarities and disparities in pain coping behavior between receivers and nonreceivers of interdisciplinary cognitive-behavioral group therapy. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 10 patients; 5 receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy in connection with their lumbar spinal fusion surgery and 5 receiving usual care. We conducted a phenomenological analysis to reach our first aim and then conducted a comparative content analysis to reach our second aim. RESULTS: Patients' postoperative experience was characterized by the need to adapt to the limitations imposed by back discomfort (coexisting with the back), need for recognition and support from others regarding their pain, a relatively long rehabilitation period during which they "awaited the result of surgery", and ambivalence toward analgesics. The patients in both groups had similar negative perception of analgesics and tended to abstain from them to avoid addiction. Coping behavior apparently differed among receivers and nonreceivers of interdisciplinary cognitive-behavioral group therapy. Receivers prevented or minimized pain by resting before pain onset, whereas nonreceivers awaited pain onset before resting. CONCLUSION: The postoperative experience entailed ambivalence, causing uncertainty, worry and insecurity. This ambivalence was relieved when others recognized the patient's pain and offered support. Cognitive-behavioral therapy as part of rehabilitation may have encouraged beneficial pain coping behavior by altering patients' pain perception and coping behavior, thereby reducing adverse effects of pain.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although rural and remote residents face general challenges accessing health care in comparison to urban dwellers, care for musculoskeletal conditions like chronic back disorders (CBD) is particularly challenging for rural and remote residents due to lack of access to physical yherapists. Telerehabilitation such as secure videoconferencing offers one solution to this disparity in rural care delivery, but incorporating the perspectives of health practitioners and patients is important when developing new sustainable care models. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study investigated the experiences of practitioners and patients during a novel interprofessional model of assessment where an urban-based physical therapist used videoconferencing to virtually join a rural nurse practitioner and a rural patient with CBD. Patient surveys and semi-structured interviews of practitioners and patients were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. RESULTS: Most patients were "very satisfied" (62.1%) or "satisfied" (31.6%) with the overall experience, and "very" (63.1%) or "somewhat (36.9%) confident" with the assessment. Thematic analysis of interviews revealed that this novel assessment method identified: access to care for CBD, effective interprofessional practice, enhanced clinical care for CBD, and technology considerations. CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction with the telerehabilitation model of care was high. Patients and practitioners reported their experiences were impacted by access to care, interprofessional practice, enhanced care for CBD and technology. These findings will be useful in the development of patient-centered models of care utilizing telehealth strategies.

AB  - Objective: Mindfulness is a nonpharmacologic mind-body therapy that has been shown to be effective in older adults with chronic low back pain (cLBP). There are few first-person accounts in the literature that describe the older adult experience and perspective while learning mindfulness and meditation to treat pain. The objective of this study was to investigate dominant themes present in the experiences of older adults applying mindfulness and meditation to cope with cLBP. Design: Qualitative analysis of four focus groups. Subject: Twenty-five adults age 65 years or older who had completed an eight-week mindfulness program. Methods: The focus groups met for a comprehensive discussion session about their experience with mindfulness and meditation. The audio for each session was recorded, and the discussions were transcribed. Codebook development, qualitative coding, and thematic analysis were performed. The coders each coded all four transcripts, following which they met to adjudicate all coding differences until they were in complete agreement on coding. Results: Several key themes were brought up by older adults utilizing mindfulness as a means of coping with pain, which included overcoming fear of pain ("Before [learning mindfulness], I used to dread pain"), pain awareness ("You're focusing more on being aware than the pain; now that's what helps me"), and pain significance ("It becomes insignificant"). Conclusions: The themes identify several ways mindfulness impacts older adults with cLBP, including decreased negative emotions related to chronic pain such as fear of pain, a different perspective or change in awareness about pain, and reducing the significance of pain.

AB  - While older adults may seek care for low back pain (LBP) from both medical doctors (MDs) and doctors of chiropractic (DCs), co-management between these providers is uncommon. The purposes of this study were to describe the preferences of older adults for LBP co-management by MDs and DCs and to identify their concerns for receiving care under such a treatment model. We conducted 10 focus groups with 48 older adults who received LBP care in the past year. Interviews explored participants’ care seeking experiences, co-management preferences, and perceived challenges to successful implementation of a MD-DC co-management model. We analyzed the qualitative data using thematic content analysis. Older adults considered LBP co-management by MDs and DCs a positive approach as the professions have complementary strengths. Participants wanted providers who worked in a co-management model to talk openly and honestly about LBP, offer clear and consistent recommendations about treatment, and provide individualized care. Facilitators of MD-DC co-management included collegial relationships between providers, arrangements between doctors to support interdisciplinary referral, computer systems that allowed exchange of health information between clinics, and practice settings where providers worked in one location. Perceived barriers to the co-management of LBP included the financial costs associated with receiving care from multiple providers concurrently, duplication of tests or imaging, scheduling and transportation problems, and potential side effects of medication and chiropractic care. A few participants expressed concern that some providers would not support a patient-preferred co-managed care model. Older adults are interested in receiving LBP treatment co-managed by MDs and DCs. Older adults considered patient-centered communication, collegial interdisciplinary interactions between these providers, and administrative supports such as scheduling systems and health record sharing as key components for successful LBP co-management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Promotion of self-care for persistent back pain and other long-term conditions has become a central component in health care policy in the UK, and general practitioners face increasing demands to support patients' self-care efforts. Gaining insight into patients' views may facilitate support. OBJECTIVE: To describe patients' experience of self-care for long-term back pain and their views on provision of support for self-care. METHODS: Adults experiencing persistent back pain were purposively sampled from a community-based survey. In-depth qualitative interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using the constant comparative method to inductively derive a thematic account of the data. RESULTS: Most of the 23 interviewees felt a responsibility to self-care. Individual capacity for self-care, however, was variable and could be inhibited by factors such as caring roles or lack of diagnosis and information. GP support for self-care was largely considered to be desirable, although the feasibility of greater provision of support was questioned. Some interviewees expressed a strong preference for alternative models of care and support. CONCLUSION: Self-care for back pain is contextualized by the individual's capacity to self-care and preferences for support. Doubt over the ability of GPs to provide support for self-care may mean that those who have specific needs are reticent to seek help. The role of self-care in the management of back pain should be discussed openly at the consultation level, and GPs may be well placed to signpost patients and provide guidance on the safety of specific self-care activities.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is associated with a number of costly disability-related outcomes. It has received increasing attention from qualitative researchers studying its consequences for personal, social, and health care experiences. As research questions and methods diversify, there is a growing need to integrate findings emerging from these studies. A meta-ethnography was carried out to synthesise the findings of 38 separate qualitative articles published on the subjective experience of CLBP between 1994 and 2011. Studies were identified following a literature search and quality appraisal. Four themes were proposed after a process of translating the meaning of text extracts from the findings sections across all the articles. The themes referred to the undermining influence of pain, its disempowering impact on all levels, unsatisfying relationships with health care professionals, and learning to live with the pain. The findings are dominated by wide-ranging distress and loss but also acknowledge self-determination and resilience. Implications of the meta-ethnography for clinicians and future qualitative research are outlined, including the need to study relatively unexamined facets of subjective experience such as illness trajectory and social identity.

AB  - Background: In the medical and scientific literature, there is a dearth of reports about how acupuncturists work and deliver care in practice. An informed characterization of the treatment process is needed to support the appropriate design of evaluative studies in acupuncture. Methods: The design was that of a nested qualitative study within a pragmatic clinical trial. Six acupuncturists who treated up to 25 patients each were interviewed after the treatment phase of the trial to obtain an account of their experiences of providing acupuncture care to patients with low back pain referred by their GP. Using semistructured interviews and a topic guide, data were collected and analyzed for both a priori and emergent themes. This paper focuses on practitioners' accounts of the goals and processes of care, and describes the strategies employed in addition to needling and other hands-on treatments. Results: From the interview data, it is clear that a coherent body of theoretical knowledge informed clinical decisions and practice, and that the goals of treatment went beyond the alleviation of immediate pain-related symptoms. Acupuncturists in this study all described a pattern of patient-centered care based on a therapeutic partnership. Study participants confirmed the importance of three processes that characterized acupuncture care in this trial, each contributing to the goal of a positive long-term outcome; building a therapeutic relationship; individualizing care; and facilitating the active engagement of patients in their own recovery. Acupuncturists described elements of care that characterized these processes including establishing rapport, facilitating communication throughout the period of care, using an interactive diagnostic process, matching treatment to the individual patient, and the use of explanatory models from Chinese medicine to aid the development of a shared understanding of the patient's condition and to motivate lifestyle changes that reinforce the potential for a recovery of health. Acupuncturists did not view these therapeutic goals, processes, and strategies as a departure from their usual practice. Conclusions: This study suggests that acupuncture care for patients with chronic conditions such as low back pain is likely to be a complex intervention that utilizes a number of patient-centered strategies to elicit longterm therapeutic benefits. Research designed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture as it is practiced in the UK needs to accommodate the full range of therapeutic goals and related treatment processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to examine the usability and utility of an office-based iPad app that we developed for older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP). The app screens for conditions that contribute to back pain and pain interference and provides personalized education based on patient responses. It also facilitates patient-provider communication regarding treatment targets and expectations. METHODS: Forty-six older adults (age >=60 years) with CLBP were recruited from the Veterans Affairs and from the Pittsburgh community. Testing was split into two phases. Alpha testing (N = 15) was used to drive design changes to the app. Beta testing (N = 30, after one participant withdrew) used a structured questionnaire to evaluate the app's usability and utility. RESULTS: The application was rated highly for usability and utility (9.6 and 8.9 out of 10, respectively). The majority of participants (82.1%) agreed that the app would help them communicate with their doctor and that it gave them useful information about potentially harmful or unnecessary interventions such as opioids and imaging (79.2% and 75.0%). Participants (age >=60 years, mean age = 75.5 years) were able to successfully use the application without assistance and would be willing to do so in their primary care office. CONCLUSIONS: We present the development of a CLBP app that screens for pain contributors and provides personalized education based on patient responses. Such an app could be employed in a variety of clinical settings to help educate patients about their CLBP and to curtail unnecessary interventions. Patient outcomes are being tested in an ongoing clinical trial.

AB  - Back pain, the most common type of pain reported by older adults, is often undertreated for reasons that are poorly understood, especially in minority populations. The objective of this study was to understand older adults’ beliefs and perspectives regarding care-seeking for restricting back pain (back pain that restricts activity).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore, describe and understand volition of chronic low back pain (LBP) patients, highlighting barriers and facilitators to practicing regular physical activity in order to develop a questionnaire assessing those volitional competencies. METHODS: A content analysis of semi-structured interviews with 30 chronic LBP patients was performed. Participants were asked about their pain, motivation, physical abilities, barriers and facilitators to regular exercises and finally strategies implemented to achieve the exercise program. RESULTS: Patients often reported that they were motivated and that exercises had no negative effects on LBP. Many patients recognized having difficulties performing all their exercises regularly. The main barriers were: lack of time, fatigue, lack of visible results, pain and other daily priorities. The main facilitators were: group exercise, help from the therapist, strategic planning, favorable environment, pleasure associated with exercises, fear of pain recurrence and pain itself. CONCLUSION: Content analysis showed that sharing stories allowed patients to express their experience of LBP in their own words. It provides a solid ground to develop a questionnaire assessing volitional competencies in chronic LBP patients in order to identify patients who will not realize their exercises and help them be (more) active and avoid chronicity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the ways that persons with long standing chronic low back pain respond to the problem of medical doubt about the presence of organic pathology. METHOD: Qualitative analysis of accounts provided by 12 persons attending a back pain rehabilitation clinic in NW England. RESULTS: Subjects rejected the notion that they were culpable for their pain. They were not culpable for the onset of their pain. They argued that despite their cooperation, no sensible explanation of their pain was forthcoming from health professionals. Finally, they asserted that medical scepticism had been damaging and dispiriting. CONCLUSION: Patients dealt with clinical doubt by stressing their own expertise. They constituted their beliefs about the cause and trajectory of their pain and disability as accurate accounts of their disability. They resisted the suggestion that there might be psychological factors involved in their ill-health by locating culpability among clinicians, who were confused or uncertain about diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - Purpose of research: The objective of this article is to investigate, from the perspective of patients, the disruptions of the biographical trajectories induced by chronic low back pain and the impact ofamultidisciplinary rehabilitation program on their reconstruction. METHODS: Based on an interdisciplinary qualitative research, we investigated the experience of 20 participants with chronic low back pain following a three-week rehabilitation program at the hospital. Semi-directive interviews were conducted before and after inclusion in the program. RESULTS: Although affecting each person in a singular way, chronic low back pain induces biographical linearity disruptions related to the apparition of pain, and the disruption of daily and professional activities. For the majority of participants, the rehabilitation program provided a repairative space to restore continuity between past, present and future life. Whether or not there is a significant improvement in pain, most participants report benefits that give them the feeling of getting back to normality. Nevertheless, they identify those more for the domestic, family, and social spheres than at the professional level, effects remaining moderate to mitigated in that area. CONCLUSIONS: The rehabilitation program influences the dynamics of biographical trajectories and promotes a return to what is perceived as normality. By providing individuals with theoretical and practical tools and increasing their functional capacities, it promotes autonomous pain and problem management. Immediate effects are seen as restorative for domestic, family and social activities, but remain limited on the professional level.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study identifies the key motivations of patients repeatedly seeking medical care for chronic back problems. DESIGN: We conducted one-on-one, in-depth interviews with patients to discuss their experiences with low back pain and its care. To validate our interpretation of the qualitative data, participants were mailed questionnaires listing the themes identified in the interviews and asked to rate the importance to them of each of the themes. SETTING: Managed health care plans in Atlanta, Dallas, and Seattle. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four patients (37% male, 63% female) who were 25 to 65 years of age and had three or more medically attended episodes of low back pain during the 3 years preceding the study. MAIN RESULTS: In describing their motivations for seeking medical care for back pain, nearly all participants cited difficulty in performing normal activities and the desire to discover the cause of the pain. Other motivations for seeking medical care for back pain included increased pain and the desire for a diagnostic test or a new treatment. Many of the verbalized reasons for repeated medical visits among patients with chronic back pain are probably best understood as seeking validation of their suffering. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic back pain report many unmet needs and expectations. Overall satisfaction might be improved if clinicians elicit patients' views of underlying causes and their expectations from office visits.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the beliefs and perceptions of patients with chronic neck and low back pain that influence adherence to home exercise during exacerbation and/or remission of pain. DESIGN: Qualitative study using a focus group technique. SUBJECTS: Thirty-four patients (23 women, age range 26-70 years) with chronic neck or low back pain who had participated in a home exercise programme. METHODS: Seven focus groups were formed. Participants were sampled purposefully from all patients with chronic neck or low back pain who attended for physiotherapy at 4 primary healthcare centres. Patients were interviewed about how they perceived their adherence to a home exercise programme during chronic pain. Data were analysed using a phenomenographic method. RESULTS: Several themes about patients' beliefs and perceptions were identified as factors related to adherence. These factors change when pain or disabilities appear, decrease or disappear for an extended period. Beliefs about illness and treatment are more likely when pain is present and when pain disappears for an extended period. However, patients consider perceptions about barriers, social support and physical environment when pain decreases. CONCLUSION: These findings may represent an important potential for improving the adherence of patients with chronic pain to home exercise programmes.

AB  - Low-back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability globally. It is complex and multifactorial, with a miriad of factors interwining and interacting to burden healthcare and individuals. Self-management support is central as part of best-practice to improve outcomes. In recent years, informatics has increasingly been considered to support care; however, due to its complex nature, several factors need to be unpacked in order to consider how technologies might support LBP. The present study utilised semi-structured interviews involving N = 20 participants (n = 10 practicing clinicains and n = 10 indidivuals living with chronic LBP (cLBP)) to collect user-centered perceptions and considerations for key factors central to technology succeeding in supporting cLBP. Six themes were identified: tracking, alterts, user-experience, communication, feedback, and content. Findings lay groundwork for future research aimed at developing technologies that can encourage shared-decision making in supporting cLBP management in a particpatory health paradigm.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a condition that causes individuals considerable distress. It also presents a significant challenge to the health service and is often viewed by clinicians as frustrating to manage. The purpose of the present paper is to explore the experiences of individuals in the immediate social sphere of those suffering from CLBP and their role in care-giving for their partner. An approach was taken using two qualitative research methods to gather data: journals and focus groups. Findings from the journals and the focus groups revealed issues for partners of CLBP sufferers in relation to living with their partners' pain, perceptions of healthcare and the dominance of illness over social contacts. Key themes revealed the complex emotions experienced by respondents, and underlined the need for their role as care givers and partners to be acknowledged by healthcare professionals. The data also highlighted respondents' desire to have greater involvement in their partners' healthcare, which includes provision of relevant information and involvement with therapeutic interventions. The findings emphasise the need for healthcare professionals to include and acknowledge partners and others in the immediate social sphere of patients in the management of chronic conditions.

AB  - Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA ABSTRACT Study Design. We conducted a structured review of eight mind-body interventions for older adults with chronic nonmalignant pain. Objectives. To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and evidence for pain reduction in older adults with chronic nonmalignant pain in the following mind-body therapies: biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, guided imagery, hypnosis, tai chi, qi gong, and yoga. Methods. Relevant studies in the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, and CINAHL databases were located. A manual search of references from retrieved articles was also conducted. Of 381 articles retrieved through search strategies, 20 trials that included older adults with chronic pain were reviewed. Results. Fourteen articles included participants aged 50 years and above, while only two of these focused specifically on persons aged ≥ 65 years. An additional six articles included persons aged ≥ 50 years. Fourteen articles were controlled trials. There is some support for the efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation plus guided imagery for osteoarthritis pain. There is limited support for meditation and tai chi for improving function or coping in older adults with low back pain or osteoarthritis. In an uncontrolled biofeedback trial that stratified by age group, both older and younger adults had significant reductions in pain following the intervention. Several studies included older adults, but did not analyze benefits by age. Tai chi, yoga, hypnosis, and progressive muscle relaxation were significantly associated with pain reduction in these studies. Conclusion. The eight mind-body interventions reviewed are feasible in an older population. They are likely safe, but many of the therapies included modifications tailored for older adults. There is not yet sufficient evidence to conclude that these eight mind-body interventions reduce chronic nonmalignant pain in older adults. Further research should focus on larger, clinical trials of mind- body interventions to answer this question.

AB  - UNLABELLED: To identify the effects of mindfulness meditation on older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP), we conducted a qualitative study based on grounded theory and used content analysis of diary entries from older adults who had participated in a clinical trial of an 8-week mindfulness meditation program. Participants were 27 adults > or = 65 years of age with CLBP of at least moderate severity and of at least 3 months duration. We found several themes reflecting the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation on pain, attention, sleep, and achieving well-being. Various methods of pain reduction were used, including distraction, increased body awareness leading to behavior change, better pain coping, and direct pain reduction through meditation. Participants described improved attention skills. A number of participants reported improved sleep latency as well as quality of sleep. Participants described achieving well-being during and after a meditation session that had immediate effects on mood elevation but also long-term global effects on improved quality of life. Several themes were identified related to pain reduction, improved attention, improved sleep, and achieving well-being resulting from mindfulness meditation that suggest it has promising potential as a nonpharmacologic treatment of chronic pain for older adults. PERSPECTIVE: Community-dwelling older adults with chronic low back pain experience numerous benefits from mindfulness meditation including less pain, improved attention, better sleep, enhanced well-being, and improved quality of life. Additional research is needed to determine how mindfulness meditation works and how it might help with other chronic illnesses.

AB  - Objective: The management of chronic low back pain (CLBP) is becoming increasingly demanding upon health care services and society. Programmes combining exercise, education and a biopsychosocial approach have become a popular way of managing CLBP. Programmes are designed to change behaviour, increase activity levels and encourage self-management. Patients' experiences of attending a back rehabilitation programme were examined.Methods: This study used a qualitative approach combining interviews, non-participant observation and evaluation of documentation to establish the patients' perspective of selfmanagement following a back programme.Results: All the patients (n = 6) indicated they were self-managing by continuing to exercise and utilizing the advice given after attendance. Two patients felt they should continue attending the therapy department to exercise in order to gain benefit, demonstrating reliance on continued health care support. Obstacles to continuing with exercise were cited as pain, time, and family constraints. Patients also expressed limitations following attendance regarding the type and level of activity their CLBP would allow them to manage. The data suggested activity limitation was inadvertently reinforced by the therapists during the sessions, in the programme letter and by the patients' existing beliefs regarding the cause of their CLBP.Conclusion: The study demonstrated the importance of understanding patients' beliefs and expectations prior to a back programme and accounting for these during attendance. This study also highlighted that all heath care professionals should be aware of the impact of the language and terminology used when working with CLBP patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate randomized clinical trials on the action of auricular acupuncture for chronic back pain in adults, and to identify the most commonly used outcomes for assessing this condition, the protocol used for applying the intervention, and the efficacy of the therapy on pain intensity. METHOD: A systematic review and a metanalysis were carried out between June 2017 and May 2018, based on the PubMed, CINAHL, PEDro, Embase, Scopus, and the Virtual Health Library databases. Reference lists of systematic reviews were also explored. RESULTS: 427 studies were located, 15 included in the qualitative analysis, and seven in the quantitative analysis. Auricular acupuncture led to positive results in 80% of the studies. The most commonly used outcomes were pain intensity and quality, medication consumption, physical disability, and quality of life. There is a lack of protocol standardization for auricular acupuncture for chronic back pain. The metanalysis results showed that auricular acupuncture was effective in reducing pain intensity scores (p=0.038). CONCLUSION: Auricular acupuncture is a promising practice for the treatment of chronic back pain in adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feedback report as a health care encounter for generating shared diagnostic meaning. METHODS: An exploratory, qualitative case study was conducted using video observation of the MRI report of findings, individual face-to-face and telephonic interviews. RESULTS: From fourteen distinct encounters, three key themes emerged, these being: 'a powerful shared experience, 'a legacy of biomedical thinking' and 'clinical practice quandaries'. Generally speaking, the MRI encounter was observed to be both an effective and satisfying method for developing shared diagnostic meaning. However, in instances where a structure-based diagnosis could not be reasonably established, clinicians experienced doubts in what to present in a 'soft report'. A feature of these was the communication of speculative causal feedback, based on non-visualised structures and/or incidental findings observed. CONCLUSION: Shared diagnostic meaning can result from a 'soft' MRI report of findings. However, the emergence of diagnostic closure is not guaranteed. Further exploration of this phenomenon in the context of shared decision making and the therapeutic alliance is warranted. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Pre-feedback peer conferences might be considered in order to standardise the information communicated to patients. Clinicians might also consider limiting the MRI scan as a visual aid in 'soft' reports.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: An important requirement for achieving postulated goals in the context of patient education is that patient education be conducted in a way that the patients can understand it. It is the objective of this explorative study to examine how patients and providers evaluate the comprehensibility and patients' comprehension of patient education under routine conditions during orthopaedic rehabilitation. Furthermore, we aim to explore the influencing factors that patients and providers describe as conducive and counterproductive to the comprehensibility of patient education, and the ideas or desires they have as to how patient education can be made more comprehensible. METHODS: We conducted guided focus groups with 50 patients with chronic back pain or osteoarthritis aged between 22 and 71 years (M=50.4, SD=9.4) and 35 patient education providers aged between 26 and 61 years (M=44.9, SD=9.8) in a total of 9 orthopaedic rehabilitation centres. Qualitative analyses of the interview transcripts were conducted according to Mayring's content analytic approach using Atlas.ti software. RESULTS: Patients and providers evaluate patient education as generally comprehensible. The involvement of patients in patient education is reported by both patients and providers as the main conducive factor. Patients describe poor (e. g. superficial or contradictory) information as counterproductive regarding comprehensibility, while providers tend to mention patients' lack of motivation and of taking personal responsibility as hindering patients' comprehension. Patients' and providers' proposals and ideas can be organized in the topics patient education (e. g. stronger reference to patients' everyday life), providers (e. g. improving providers' tutoring skills), information (e. g. more information), patient involvement (e. g. stronger consideration of patients' interests), organization (e. g. smaller groups), and goal clarification (e. g. consideration of patients' expectations). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that good comprehensibility can be achieved in patient education during routine orthopaedic rehabilitation. They also show the factors that account for good comprehensibility. The counterproductive factors described by patients and providers provide evidence of the factors that may hold potential for improving patient education with regard to comprehensibility.

AB  - PURPOSE: This interview study aimed to capture an account of change in low back pain over time and understand the interaction of known bio-psychosocial risk factors. METHODS: Thirty-four participants from the Back Skills Training (BeST) U.K. trial, evaluating a cognitive behavioural approach intervention for LBP, gave 61 interviews. Semi-structured interviews taken once or twice post intervention explored participants' experiences of LBP and the intervention received. Initial thematic analysis of the data gave themes, which participants spoke about in an integrated way. Rereading of whole transcripts identified interactions between themes, which we classified as helpful or unhelpful to recovery. The team also explored whether there were correlations with Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) scores from the main trial. RESULTS: Web diagrams gave a graphic representation of the interactions between factors, which were highly individual and time specific. We identified three categories of webs; dense web (mostly unhelpful), open web (helpful and unhelpful) and sparse web (mostly helpful). These categories correlated with (RMDQ) scores. CONCLUSIONS: Facilitators as well as potential barriers to recovery give added insight when considering psychosocial risk factors. Web categories highlight patterns of interaction between psychosocial factors, which underlie levels of disability. These patterns of interaction may help to guide clinicians in their choice of treatment approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management is the key recommendation for managing nonspecific low back pain (LBP). However, there are well-documented barriers to self-management; therefore, methods of facilitating adherence are required. Smartphone apps are increasingly being used to support self-management of long-term conditions such as LBP. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the usability and acceptability of the SELFBACK smartphone app, designed to support and facilitate self-management of non-specific LBP. The app provides weekly self-management plans, comprising physical activity, strength and flexibility exercises, and patient education. The plans are tailored to the patient's characteristics and symptom progress by using case-based reasoning methodology. METHODS: The study was carried out in 2 stages using a mixed-methods approach. All participants undertook surveys, and semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with a subgroup of participants. Stage 1 assessed an app version with only the physical activity component and a web questionnaire that collects information necessary for tailoring the self-management plans. The physical activity component included monitoring of steps recorded by a wristband, goal setting, and a scheme for sending personalized, timely, and motivational notifications to the user's smartphone. Findings from Stage 1 were used to refine the app and inform further development. Stage 2 investigated an app version that incorporated 3 self-management components (physical activity, exercises, and education). A total of 16 participants (age range 23-71 years) with ongoing or chronic nonspecific LBP were included in Stage 1, and 11 participants (age range 32-56 years) were included in Stage 2. RESULTS: In Stage 1, 15 of 16 participants reported that the baseline questionnaire was easy to answer, and 84% (13/16) found the completion time to be acceptable. Overall, participants were positive about the usability of the physical activity component but only 31% (5/16) found the app functions to be well integrated. Of the participants, 90% (14/16) were satisfied with the notifications, and they were perceived as being personalized (12/16, 80%). In Stage 2, all participants reported that the web questionnaire was easy to answer and the completion time acceptable. The physical activity and exercise components were rated useful by 80% (8/10), while 60% (6/10) rated the educational component useful. Overall, participants were satisfied with the usability of the app; however, only 50% (5/10) found the functions to be well integrated, and 20% (2/10) found them to be inconsistent. Overall, 80% (8/10) of participants reported it to be useful for self-management. The interviews largely reinforced the survey findings in both stages. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that participants considered the SELFBACK app to be acceptable and usable and that they thought it would be useful for supporting self-management of LBP. However, we identified some limitations and suggestions useful to guide further development of the SELFBACK app and other mobile health interventions.

AB  - The aim of the study was to explore patients' narratives of embodied experiences through treatment courses of Norwegian psychomotor physiotherapy (NPMP). An NPMP specialist and two patients with chronic back pain participated in two long-term treatment courses. Research data were drawn from in-depth interviews and repeated video recordings with patients and physiotherapist. Reflective notes were written by patients. In order to study the relationship between narratives and bodily expressions in succeeding sessions, a three-step procedure was applied: identification of main types of narratives, identification of sub-themes and detailed analysis of selected part-processes. Patients gave meaning to back pain as an expression of long-lasting relational strain. Two main narrative patterns were identified: 'Being in touch with' and 'Being detached from' the body. The patients described the treatment course as 'becoming an embodied subject' changing their experience of back pain, their rhythm of breathing and sensation of legs. Change was based on the therapeutic relationship encouraging reflection on embodied experiences. The study showed how NPMP may assist the patient to develop potentially healing narratives and an improved sensation of their body by integrating a physical and a verbal therapy approach.

AB  - The study's purpose was to explore change and perception of change related to patients with chronic back and/or neck pain through treatment courses of Norwegian psychomotor physiotherapy. A multiple case synthesis of nine cases, nine patients and five physiotherapists, was based on in-depth interviews and repeated video-recordings. Patients wrote reflective notes. In order to study changing processes within and over sessions a two-step procedure was applied: identifying main changing patterns, and identifying patient groups concerning similarities and varieties of main changing patterns. Five changing patterns were identified: (i) to move restricted and non-restricted; (ii) to breathe restricted and non-restricted; (iii) to reflect in a non-exploring and exploring way; (iv) to not transfer and transfer experience from treatment to daily life; and (v) to be detached from and to be in touch with the body. Two patient groups were identified: the limited and the considerable change groups. The process of self-perception seemed to be integrated in all the changing patterns, and to be a basis for reducing pain, and changing movement, breath and expression within and outside therapy. Self-perception appeared as a process of varying acts and self-knowledge. Merleau-Ponty's phenomenological perspective of perception may add to the understanding of change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteopathy in Australia is a primary care limited scope practice. Practitioner surveys suggest that patients present with chronic pain and receive manual therapies, exercise and lifestyle advice. Further research is required to deepen the understanding of this intervention from the perspective of patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experience of patients receiving osteopathic healthcare. DESIGN: Mixed methodology. METHOD: A quantitative survey of a convenience sample of patients was followed by qualitative semi-structured interviews in a purposive sample of respondents with chronic non-specific low back pain. The transcripts were analysed using a phenomenological approach. RESULTS: The survey results suggested directions of enquiry for the interviews. Eleven subjects were interviewed and reported commonalities in their clinical histories with multisystem co-morbidities. Four themes became apparent: patient decision-making, patient shared experiences of the osteopathic healthcare consultation, tailored patient-centred care, and therapeutic relationship in healthcare. CONCLUSION: This data suggests that patients experience osteopathic healthcare after trying other disciplines; that there are shared aspects of the consultations, with a thorough assessment, education about their condition, multiple manual therapies and lifestyle advice; that the experience is patient-centred and tailored to their context; and that the therapeutic relationship is a key aspect of the experience. These results reflect a number of aspects of osteopathic healthcare from workplace surveys.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess views of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) concerning barriers to home-based exercise program adherence and to record expectations regarding new technologies. DESIGN: Qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: A heterogeneous sample of 29 patients who performed a home-based exercise program for cLBP learned during supervised physiotherapy sessions in a tertiary care hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were interviewed at home by the same trained interviewer. Interviews combined a funnel-shaped structure and an itinerary method. RESULTS: Barriers to adherence related to the exercise program (number, effectiveness, complexity and burden of exercises), the healthcare journey (breakdown between supervised sessions and home exercise, lack of follow-up and difficulties in contacting care providers), patient representations (illness and exercise perception, despondency, depression and lack of motivation), and the environment (attitudes of others, difficulties in planning exercise practice). Adherence could be enhanced by increasing the attractiveness of exercise programs, improving patient performance (following a model or providing feedback), and the feeling of being supported by care providers and other patients. Regarding new technologies, relatively younger patients favored visual and dynamic support that provided an enjoyable and challenging environment and feedback on their performance. Relatively older patients favored the possibility of being guided when doing exercises. Whatever the tool proposed, patients expected its use to be learned during a supervised session and performance regularly checked by care providers; they expected adherence to be discussed with care providers. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with cLBP, adherence to home-based exercise programs could be facilitated by increasing the attractiveness of the programs, improving patient performance and favoring a feeling of being supported. New technologies meet these challenges and seem attractive to patients but are not a substitute for the human relationship between patients and care providers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In chronic conditions, such as back pain, the use of interventions that address physical, social and psychological aspects within a biopsychosocial framework are encouraged, however, applying this holistic multimodal approach in physical therapy practice (i.e., chiropractic and physiotherapy) is challenging. To explore the problem of delivering a biopsychosocially informed package of care in physical therapy practice a recent randomised control trial (RCT) called 'Mind Your Back' was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined physical and internet-delivered psychological intervention (psychologically informed physical treatments) compared to standard treatment for improving disability and self-efficacy in people with chronic LBP. The results of the trial indicated no difference between the two intervention groups. Although high-quality RCTs are considered gold standard for effectiveness of interventions, qualitative research methods embedded within a process evaluation framework are also used to reveal other issues and important information that help to explain clinical trial results, and to further the field of digital health interventions research. Therefore, within a process evaluation framework, the aim is to explore participants experiences of the interventions received throughout the Mind Your Back trial which led to a null result. METHODS: In-line with recommendations for a process evaluation this study used in-depth interviews and qualitative thematic analysis with participants of both arms of the trial 5-6 months after study completion. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with twenty-five participants to explore their experiences of taking part in the Mind Your Back trial. Interviews were conducted in November 2017, transcribed verbatim and data analysed thematically. RESULTS: Two main themes were identified: (1) Personalised support and therapeutic alliance are important, and (2) MoodGYM lacked relevant, personalised and tailored support. CONCLUSION: It is important to deliver tailored digital health supports that is personalised and fosters a therapeutic alliance.

AB  - PURPOSE: The primary aim of this study was to explore relevant outcome domains for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) undergoing physiotherapy. A secondary aim was to examine potential discrepancies between meaningful changes in pain and disability and the global perception of improvement. METHODS: An explanatory mixed methods design was employed. Twenty-two patients with CLBP completed self-reported measures before and after a physiotherapy programme. After the intervention, three focus groups were conducted with patients who perceived an overall improvement. Discussions were recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis showed an inconsistent relationship between changes in pain and disability measures and global improvements as perceived by patients. Two main themes emerged from the thematic analysis: "pain relief" (subthemes: reducing pain intensity and other symptoms; reducing medication intake; improving sleep quality) and "gaining control over the LBP condition" (subthemes: ability to self-manage; return to function; and sense of well-being and normality). CONCLUSION: Patients with CLBP perceived multiple outcomes from physiotherapy treatment that cover the domains of global, physical, mental and social health. These study findings suggest that the targets of measurement for physiotherapy need to be expanded in order to reflect outcome domains valued by patients.Implications for rehabilitationMinimum important changes in pain intensity and disability were not valid indicators of global improvements as perceived by patients.Patients with chronic low back pain undergoing physiotherapy perceived gains in multiple health domains that ranged beyond pain and disability domains.Physiotherapy outcome assessment needs to integrate other patient-relevant outcomes such as medication intake, sleep quality, ability to self-manage and sense of well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) prevalence has steadily increased over the last two decades. Manual therapy (MT) is recommended within a multimodal management approach to improve pain and disability although evidence investigating the patients' experience of MT is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To explore expectations and perceptions of MT techniques in people with CLBP. METHODS: A qualitative study embedded sequential to an experimental trial using semi-structured interviews (SSI) explored participants' experiences of thrust, non-thrust and sham technique. Purposive sampling enabled variance in age and CLBP duration. An evidence informed topic guide was used. Data were analysed using thematic analysis (TA). Respondent validation and peer debriefing enhanced trustworthiness. The Consolidating Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) reported methodological rigour. FINDINGS: Ten participants (50% male) with a mean age of 29.1 years (Standard Deviation (SD): 7.9, range: 19-43), a mean pain intensity of 4.5 on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) 0-10 (SD: 1.5, range: 2-7), a mean Oswestry Disability Score (ODI) of 9 (SD: 4.6, range: 2-17) and a mean Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) score of 38.6 (SD: 4.8, range: 30-45) participated. Four themes were identified: understanding of pain; forming expectations; perception of care; re-evaluation of body awareness and management. Understanding of CLBP is formed by an individuals' pain perception and exchange with social environment. This, combined with communication with physiotherapist influenced expectations regarding the MT technique. CONCLUSION: Expectations for MT were formed by an individual's social environment and previous experience. A treatment technique is perceived as positive if its characteristics are aligned with the individual's understanding of pain and if care is delivered in an informative and reassuring manner.

AB  - Cultural beliefs and values are increasingly understood to influence the experience of pain, health-seeking, and pain management behaviours. Research exploring cultural beliefs about pain is particularly needed for Indian migrants, who have a high prevalence of pain and are among the largest migrant communities in Australia and internationally. The objective of this study was to explore pain-related beliefs and coping strategies of Hindi-speaking Indian migrants with chronic back pain living in Sydney. Indian migrants (n=26) completed a demographic survey, standardised pain questionnaires (RMDQ, PSEQ and BBQ) and participated in one of five focus group discussions. This cohort had low levels of disability: Mean (SD) [RMDQ 5.04 (3.2)], high self-efficacy [PSEQ 44.6 (8.8)], and relatively positive beliefs about back pain [BBQ 28.6 (4.4)]. Three categories of interconnected beliefs emerged from the focus groups: causative, treatment/coping-related, and prognostic beliefs underpinned by a core cultural belief in 'the philosophy of Karma'. Within this core philosophy, three cultural values were central to the experience of pain and the construction of pain-related beliefs: collectivism and contribution, gendered roles, and mind-body wellness. The incorporation of holistic approaches to back pain management with an emphasis on mindfulness, exercise, and physical activity aligned with family-oriented goals could be considered for management of chronic back pain among Indian migrant communities.

AB  - Introduction Paramedics have physically demanding jobs. Lower back pain is an occupation-related health condition that may cause difficulty with, or inability to, lift. Existing literature on lower back pain in paramedics is scant; no qualitative study specifically of lower back pain experiences or treatment was found. This qualitative study aimed to explore paramedics' experience of chronic lower back pain, with a focus on their expectations of musculoskeletal treatment. Methods Nine paramedics (seven men, two women) who had sought chiropractic, physiotherapy, or osteopathy treatment for one or more episodes of chronic lower back pain, while working as a paramedic, were recruited from the national ambulance service. A general inductive qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interview data were thematically analysed. Results The core theme was 'frustration'. For paramedics, frustration stemmed from the difficulties and delays finding a musculoskeletal practitioner who could 'help'; the widespread experience of lower back pain among paramedics that apparently went unacknowledged; their inability to make alterations at work; their risk of re-injuring their back at any time; and concerns about their future and job insecurity because they might not be able to continue working as a paramedic in the future due to their lower back pain Conclusion The experience of the nine New Zealand paramedics interviewed for this study was frustration due to difficulties and delays in finding the right provider of helpful treatment, and persistent uncertainty about their future. Participants wished that the industry had better and more explicit organisational processes for managing lower back pain at work, and supporting them to better back health and being fit for work.

AB  - The perceived health needs of 50 chronic low back pain patients were explored within an interview procedure. Patients described symptom and treatment histories, the problems they encountered living with back pain and their severity. Problems as goals for recovery were prioritized. The last two tasks were aided by the use of a Problem Board. Interviews were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Results indicated that the use of this patient-centred procedure could be helpful in outlining individual concerns, translatable into recovery goals for intervention, regardless of concurrent medical treatment. Implications of this approach for individual needs assessment in chronic conditions and for planning service development are discussed.

AB  - This article explores the meaning of diagnostic tests for people with chronic back pain. Lower back pain is one of the most common health problems in the US. Five to ten percent of the patients who visit a primary care provider for back pain ultimately develop a chronic condition. We draw on interviews with chronic back pain patients in Atlanta, Dallas and Seattle to argue that testing constitutes an important element in the legitimation of pain for these patients. We discuss three aspects that make testing an area of concern for patients: a strong historical connection between visual images and the medicalization of the interior of the body, a set of cultural assumptions that make seeing into the body central to confirming and normalizing patients' symptoms, and the concreteness of diagnostic images themselves. Our interviews show that when physicians cannot locate the problem or express doubt about the possibility of a solution, patients feel that their pain is disconfirmed. Faced with the disjunction between the cultural model of the visible body and the private experience of pain, patients are alienated not only from individual physicians but from an important aspect of the symbolic world of medicine. This paper concludes by suggesting that a fluid, less localized understanding of pain could provide a greater sense of legitimacy for back pain patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathoanatomical beliefs about the cause of low back pain may negatively influence patients' perceptions of 'best care', such as the inclusion of exercise for low back pain (LBP) management. The aims of this study were to explore what patients receiving manual therapy are told and understand about their LBP diagnosis, and how this affects their perceptions regarding the role of exercise in the management of their LBP. DESIGN: An interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) study design was utilised using semi-structured telephone interviews of patients who experience persistent LBP and seek care at an outpatient clinic at the University of South Wales. Ten participants were interviewed for the study (six male). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an IPA approach. RESULTS: Three main themes were generated: (1) Constructing explanation of pain. (2) Expectations of exercise within care seeking behaviours. (3) Resolving conflict between exercise and back pain narratives. Participants linked their pain to a pathoanatomical cause, impacting their beliefs on exercise as a treatment approach. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic models used by clinicians which are grounded within a pathoanatomical framework influence patients' perceptions and rationale for exercise. Exercise prescription using contemporary pain science and biopsychosocial approaches should be emphasised in practice and education.

AB  - One of the main causes of chronic pain in older people is spine deformity, an abnormal curvature of the spine. The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of the experience of chronic pain produced by spinal deformity in older people and understand how cultural factors may affect this experience. A qualitative study was performed with 10 older people. Participants were encouraged to describe a typical day in their life, including the factors that affect their pain and how their quality of life had been affected since experiencing chronic pain. The semistructured interviews were transcribed and analyzed using open coding. Pain caused by spine deformity produces disability, affecting how older people perform their daily activities, causing them to adapt their households and physical positions to perform these tasks, albeit slowly or incompletely. Chronic pain also affects emotional states and social relationships because older people become unable to undertake physical activities that they performed in the past. The close relationship with adult children and friends, typical in Latin cultures, is a source of comfort and support. At a community level, adaptation of public services (such as public transportation) must be improved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic back pain is a disease many people suffer from it and they have different problems and needs. OBJECTIVES: Due to the vague nature of these needs and lack of information in this regard, the present research was aimed to identify the needs of the patients suffering from chronic back pain. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted using content analysis method. Here, 29 participants entered the study using a purposive sampling; they were interviewed one by one, face to face, and in a semi-structural mode. Gathering the data, transcribing the interviews, and analyzing them were performed simultaneously using Graneheim and Lundman method. First, codification and meaning similarities were revised and the subthemes were identified; then, in the second revision, the related subthemes were put in one category. The data were analyzed using the max Q software version 2007. RESULTS: Analyzing the results led to deriving four main themes and nine categories. The main themes were related to the needs of the patients suffering from chronic back pain, including teaching and informing, religious-spiritual dimension, socio-economic dimension, and physical-psychological dimension. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a comprehensive understanding of the health-related needs of the patients suffering from chronic back pain in Iran. According to the obtained criteria from this study, identifying the needs, planning for them, and evaluating the measures taken for the patients suffering from chronic back pain will become possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to an exercise programme impacts the outcome of physiotherapy treatment in patients with non-specific low back pain. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the patients' perspectives on long term adherence to such exercise programmes. DESIGN: This qualitative study was embedded in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) which compared the effectiveness of two types of exercise programme on patients with nonspecific low back pain. METHODS: Answers from 44 participants to three open-ended questions were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Patients' perceptions related to the following themes: 1) the role of knowledge in long-term exercise adherence; 2) strategies to support exercise adherence; 3) barriers to exercise adherence 4) the role of perceived effects of exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to long-term exercise is supported through knowledge of the exercises and correct performance. A self-initiated training strategy is the most successful in the perception of participants. Individually supervised physiotherapy treatment that includes coaching towards strategies for post-treatment long term exercise behaviour is recommended.

AB  - Many desirable outcomes depend on good patient-physician communication. Patient-based perspectives of what constitutes competent communication behavior with physicians are needed for patient-oriented health care. Therefore it was our main aim to identify competent patient communication skills from the patient's perspective. We also wanted to reveal any differences in opinion among various groups (chronic ischemic heart disease, chronic low back pain, breast cancer). This study examined nine guideline-supported focus groups in rehabilitation centers. The criterion for study inclusion was any one of the three diagnoses. Enrolled in the study were N = 49 patients (32 women) aged M = 60.1 (SD = 12.8). The interview recordings were transcribed and subjected to content analysis. We documented 396 commentaries in these interviews that were allocated to 82 different codes; these in turn resulted in the formation of 12 main topics. Examples are: posing questions, being an active and participatory patient, being aware of emotions and communicating them. This study represents stage two ('documentation of patient and clinician views') in the seven-stage model of communication research. Findings reveal that chronically-ill patients name behaviours that contribute to successful discussion with a physician. These enable us to develop communication trainings and design-measuring tools used for patient-based communication skills.

AB  - PURPOSE: Information plays an important role in the management and treatment of chronic pain conditions. Often, however, delivered information does not address specific difficulties of consumers. The present study illustrates the design and implementation of the website ONESELF - run by the Institute of Communication and Health of the University of Lugano - which has been created to meet the ranging of informational needs of chronic low back pain sufferers. METHOD: ONESELF rests on an integrated idea of health literacy that highlights the kind of information consumers need to inform their decisions about back pain. This idea has been tested through a qualitative analysis of requests posted by users in the forum of ONESELF between July 2006 and December 2007. RESULTS: Users seek information to build their declarative (factual) and procedural knowledge, as well as to evaluate that knowledge and apply it to the context of their own life. CONCLUSION: Online interactional tools such as ONESELF are a promising source of health communication, provided that the content manager of the website and the health professionals collaborate in a rigorously structured manner. ONESELF can benefit traditional medical consultations in helping screen requests from patients that do not need to see a doctor, and in acting as a repository of background information that saves consultation time for more urgent matters.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Overuse of diagnostic imaging for patients with low back pain remains common. The underlying beliefs about diagnostic imaging that could drive overuse remain unclear. We synthesised qualitative research that has explored clinician, patient or general public beliefs about diagnostic imaging for low back pain. DESIGN: A qualitative evidence synthesis using a thematic analysis. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO from inception to 17 June 2019. Qualitative studies that interviewed clinicians, patients and/or general public exploring beliefs about diagnostic imaging for low back pain were included. Four review authors independently extracted data and organised these according to themes and subthemes. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool to critically appraise included studies. To assess confidence in review findings, we used the GRADE-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research method. RESULTS: We included 69 qualitative studies with 1747 participants. Key findings included: Patients and clinicians believe diagnostic imaging is an important test to locate the source of low back pain (33 studies, high confidence); patients with chronic low back pain believe pathological findings on diagnostic imaging provide evidence that pain is real (12 studies, moderate confidence); and clinicians ordered diagnostic imaging to reduce the risk of a missed diagnosis that could lead to litigation, and to manage patients' expectations (12 studies, moderate confidence). CONCLUSION: Clinicians and patients can believe that diagnostic imaging is an important tool for locating the source of non-specific low back pain. Patients may underestimate the harms of unnecessary imaging tests. These beliefs could be important targets for intervention. Prospero registration number: Crd42017076047.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common and persistent problem. Research studies seeking to improve the quality of management of this condition have tended to ignore the opinions of patients. There is a growing acceptance of the importance of taking patients' views into account in developing management and educational programmes for a variety of conditions. AIM: This study set out to elicit the views of patients concerning low back pain and its management in general practice. METHOD: Fifty-two in-depth interviews were conducted with patients selected from a broad range of 12 general practices. RESULTS: Analysis of the interviews identified seven themes relating to: quality of life, prognosis, secondary prevention, help-seeking behaviour, explanation of underlying pathology, satisfaction with general practitioner management, and complementary therapy. Different patient viewpoints or perspectives were expressed within each of these themes. Patients adapted to the progress of their low back pain and were not seeking a 'magical cure' from either conventional or complementary therapies. CONCLUSION: Patients' views on low back pain are heterogeneous. The dissatisfaction expressed with medical explanations for the pain may be related to superficial clinical management and the constraints of general practice. Good management of low back pain needs to take patients' complex views of the condition into account.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine participant experience of exercise programs for nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). Systematic reviews have concluded that exercise is effective for decreasing pain and improving function in adults with NSCLBP. Participation is a key ingredient in exercise and patient's experiences during these programs may be important in influencing outcomes. DESIGN: Qualitative methods with three focus groups facilitated by an independent, experienced facilitator. METHODS: Eighteen people aged over 18 years were included. They had to speak, read and understand English and participated in an exercise program for NSCLBP. Each group was guided with a series of predetermined questions to elicit their experience of participation in exercise programs. Participants were encouraged to give personal opinions freely. Transcribed data were read independently by two researchers and analysed thematically with grounded theory. RESULTS: Stigma emerged as a significant theme in all focus group transcripts. The results demonstrate that people with NSCLBP experience both subtle and overt stigmatization. The following subthemes emerged: stigma perpetrated by health care providers; stigma facilitated by the "sickness versus wellness" model; stigma applied by friends, family, the community, the workplace, and the low back pain subgroup; stigma-associated diagnostic uncertainty and the need for pathology driven validation. CONCLUSIONS: The ramifications of stigma and discrimination are enduring, potentially disabling and appear to interfere with care-seeking, rehabilitation participation, and potentially, rehabilitation outcomes. Public and health professional education, low back pain-specific support groups and dissemination of success stories may help to alleviate stigma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate and summarize participant experience of exercise programmes for non-specific chronic low back pain and the effects of these experiences on exercise participation and engagement. SUBJECTS: Three groups of six adults (>18 years) who speak, read and understand English and who had participated in an exercise programme for non-specific chronic low back pain. METHOD: Qualitative research methods were used and three focus groups were conducted by an experienced facilitator. Each group was guided with a set of pre-determined questions and participants were encouraged to give personal opinions. Transcribed data were read independently by two researchers and analysed thematically according to Grounded Theory. RESULTS: Preference for partnership in care emerged as a significant theme from all focus group transcripts. The following subthemes emerged: (1) engagement with the health care process; (2) 'listen to me; I know my own body'; (3) 'tell me: explain it to me'. People with non-specific chronic low back pain want an active role in their rehabilitation. They expressed anger and frustration at not being listened to, not being provided with adequate explanations and education and not being given credit for knowing their own bodies. Tension existed between patients' wanting a genuine voice in the partnership and them wanting a care-provider to give explicit diagnosis and best management instruction. CONCLUSION: A gap exists between care-seeker experiences of, and preferences for, exercise programmes for back pain. Care-seekers consider that care-providers should adopt a willingness to listen and consider care-seeker's experiences when designing exercise programmes.

AB  - Question: What factors do participants in exercise programs for chronic low back pain perceive to be important for engagement and participation? Design: Qualitative study of three focus groups. Participants: 18 adults with chronic low back pain who had participated in exercise programs for chronic low back pain. Results: All focus group results concurred and two significant themes emerged from the focus group data. The first was that the experience of exercise informed participant preferences with respect to exercise environment and type of exercise. Participants described a range of positive and negative experiences, a desire to master exercise techniques, and a preference for exercise that matched their abilities and prior skills. The second significant theme was the helpful and empowering skills of the care-provider, and care-seeker ability to identify and articulate their own needs. Participants regarded carer expertise favourably when positive results were achieved early in the interaction, but were frustrated when they were not listened to and symptoms were aggravated. The relationship was enhanced by effective communication. Participants also recognised they needed to be aware of their own skills and abilities and, and that financial or family support incentives encouraged their adherence to a program. Conclusion: People are likely to prefer and participate in exercise programs that are designed with consideration of their preferences, circumstances, and past exercise experiences. We propose that information about patient exercise preferences should be collected systematically.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The global burden of low back pain is the highest ranked condition contributing to years of living with disability. Exercise is moderately effective, and adherence to exercise may improve if participants are engaged. Identification of elements that enhance engagement would enable clinicians to prescribe appropriate interventions. The review objective was to identify and synthesize qualitative empirical studies that have explored beliefs about exercise therapy of people with nonspecific chronic low back pain. METHODS: Two independent reviewers conducted a structured review and metasynthesis informed by Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA statement. Fifteen papers were included for data extraction, method quality assessment, and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four key themes emerged: (1) perceptions and classification of exercise; (2) role and impact of the health professional; (3) exercise and activity enablers/facilitators; (4) exercise and activity barriers. Participants believed that there were distinctions between general activity, real/fitness exercise, and medical exercise. Levels of acquired skills and capability and participant experience with exercise culture require consideration in program design. People participating in exercise classes and group work may be more comfortable when matched for abilities and experience. When an intervention interferes with everyday life and appears to be ineffective or too difficult to implement, people make a reasoned decision to discontinue. DISCUSSION: People are likely to prefer and participate in exercise or training programs and activities that are designed with consideration of their preferences, circumstances, fitness levels, and exercise experiences.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore which factors lead to tension in the patient-physician interaction in the first consultation by rehabilitation physicians of patients with chronic non-specific low back pain of Turkish and Moroccan origin. METHOD: In-depth semi-structured, face to face interviews were conducted with 12 patients of Moroccan and Turkish origin and four native Dutch rehabilitation physicians. Interviews were transcribed and/or summarised. All interviews were subsequently coded and analysed according to themes. RESULTS: Factors that lead to tension in the patient-physician interaction were as follows: differences in expectations regarding the aim of treatment, symptom presentation, views on responsibilities with regard to rehabilitation treatment, lack of trust, contradicting views of physicians from patients' country of origin with regard to the cause and treatment of pain and communication problems. CONCLUSION: Sources of tension were identified during the interaction between Dutch physicians and patients of Turkish and Moroccan origin. These factors potentially are associated with future drop-out. Future research should clarify whether these factors indeed are associated with drop-out.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore which factors led to drop-out in patients of Turkish and Moroccan origin with chronic non-specific low back pain who participated in a rehabilitation programme. SUBJECTS: Patients of Turkish or Moroccan origin with chronic non-specific low back pain (n = 23) from 2 rehabilitation centres and 4 rehabilitation departments of general hospitals in the Netherlands. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients of Turkish and Moroccan origin (n = 23), rehabilitation physicians (n = 8) and rehabilitation therapists (n = 2). Interviews were transcribed or summarized and subsequently coded and analysed according to themes. RESULTS: Most patients dropped out due to expectations of a specific medical diagnosis and pain relief as the main aims of rehabilitation treatment. Other reasons for drop-out detected in the interviews were: lack of acknowledgement of the patient's complaints, lack of trust in the rehabilitation physician, contradicting views to those of the physician from the patients' country of origin with regard to the cause and treatment of pain, and communication problems. CONCLUSION: The major reason for drop-out was patients having different expectations, from those of their health providers, of the aim of treatment, as a result of a different view of the origin and treatment of low back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A predominantly quantitative approach to the psychological study of chronic low back pain (CLBP) has shown that enduring negative emotional responses and passive coping strategies contribute towards disability. The main objective of this study was to extend existing knowledge by providing a detailed and contextualized understanding of the meaning of CLBP for participants with long-standing experiences of chronic pain. DESIGN: This is a qualitative, semi-structured interview study. The data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). This is the first of three sets of individual interviews comprising a longitudinal study of the same participants over 3 years. METHODS: Ten patients with CLBP were interviewed prior to their attendance at a medically staffed chronic pain clinic. The sample comprised seven females and three males. Ages ranged between 39 and 66 years. All had experienced CLBP for at least 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: The participants' experiences are represented by three main themes: 'maintaining integrity', 'the crucial nature of the pain' and 'managing the pain' that highlight participants' understanding of their pain within a biomedical framework. The findings are discussed with reference to the role of illness beliefs in the management of CLBP.

AB  - This paper present data from the second and third rounds of a three-phase longitudinal research project exploring the 'lived experiences' of patients with chronic low-back pain (CLBP) in the United Kingdom. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants 1 and 2 years after the first interviews and after attendance at a medically staffed chronic pain clinic. The transcribed accounts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis and results compared with the data from time one. A main challenge for participants was managing constant unchanging pain experiences and loss across all areas of their lives. Some participants held consistent biomedical understandings of CLBP, continued to focus on the physicality of their pain and adopt a narrow range of behavioural-focused coping strategies and maintained a strong loss orientation. It is proposed that these elements demonstrated embodied experiences and contributed to comprehensive enmeshment of self and pain with little re-establishment of any behavioural activity. In comparison, participants who had experienced pain relief due to physical treatments showed increased use of mind-body strategies, a future orientation and were considered to be less enmeshed in their experiences. These changes were discussed in relation to the relationship between pain remission and illness beliefs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The purpose of this qualitative metasynthesis is to articulate the knowledge gained from a review of qualitative studies of patients' experiences of chronic low back pain. METHODS Meta-ethnographic methodology guided the review of 33 articles representing 28 studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2012. A systematic comparison of the main themes from each study was conducted and 'synthesised' to create superordinate themes. RESULTS Three overarching interrelated themes were identified: the impact of chronic low back pain on self; relationships with significant others that incorporated two streams - health professionals and the organisation of care and relationships with family and friends; coping with chronic low back pain. Coping strategies were predominantly physical therapies, medication and avoidance behaviours with very few successful strategies reported. Professional and family support, self-efficacy, motivation, work conditions and exercise opportunities influenced pain experiences. Review authors' recommendations included psychological therapies, education, the facilitation of self-management strategies and support groups. DISCUSSION The review substantiates chronic low back pain as complex, dynamic and multidimensional, underpinned by experiences of persistent distressing pain, loss, and lowered self-worth, stigma, depression, premature aging, fear of the future. Future research should address the paucity of longitudinal studies, loss and issues of ethnicity, gender, ageing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on the patients' perception of the treatment with spinal stabilisation exercises and their overall experience of the treatment programme. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to elicit valuable information of the experiences of patients who participated in a spinal stabilisation programme within a randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHOD: A qualitative study. PARTICIPANTS: Nine participants (male = 3, female = 6) were selected, to participate in focus group interviews from among those who participated in the RCT on the use of stabilization exercises in the treatment of chronic low back pain. A semi-structured interview comprising of open ended questions were used. Audio recording was used to record participants' opinions during the interview process. Careful checking, reading and correction of the transcript from the interviews were carried out and a thematic analysis was conducted on the data. RESULTS: Participant's explanations for the perceived improvements were not limited to the positive effects of stabilisation exercise on pain severity, functional disability and quality of life but also reflected major increases in confidence and the formulation of self help strategies and the ability to exert better control over their back pain due to more knowledge of the spine and how it works. CONCLUSION: Participants views on the benefit of stabilisation exercise programme are heterogeneous. However, the opinions of many of the participants in this study seem to have indicated satisfaction with the programme.

AB  - Spinal stabilisation exercises are commonly used in the management of low back pain (LBP). There is limited evidence relating to patients' experiences of their involvement in such programmes. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of a sample of individuals with chronic LBP who participated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the most efficacious dosage and frequency of spinal stabilisation exercises. The qualitative study involved nine participants who took part in focus group discussions. The data were analysed using thematic content analysis and provided insights into the experiences of the participants. Four themes emerged: Physical dimensions of the LBP experience, emotional and psychological dimensions of the LBP experience and perceived effects of the programme and lastly, the impact of the treatment programme on participants' knowledge, understanding and adherence. In conclusion participants' experiences were not limited to the positive effects of stabilisation exercises on pain, functional disability and quality of life, but also reflected increases in confidence, the formulation of self help strategies and the ability to exert better control over their LBP. The findings highlight the importance of well planned associated educational support packages in the treatment of LBP paving the way for future qualitative research.

AB  - Background: Providing an effective exercise prescription process for a patient with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) within the limits of time that a busy clinician faces is a challenging task. Emerging research has indicated that partnership in care and shared decision making are important for people with NSCLBP, and calls for further investigation into the approaches used to prescribe exercise.Objective: To explore the characteristics and processes of physiotherapy exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP, and investigate how shared decision making and patient partnership are addressed by physiotherapists in this process.Design: A qualitative study using a philosophical hermeneutic approach. In phase one of the study eight physiotherapists were each observed on three occasions undertaking their usual clinical activities. They participated in brief interviews after each observation and a later in depth semi-structured interview. In phase two semi-structured interviews with eight patients including use of some brief patient vignettes was undertaken to provide a rich descriptive text of their personal experiences of receiving exercise as part of the management of their NSCLBP, and their involvement in decisions regarding their treatment plans. In depth iterative hermeneutic strategies were used to interpret the texts and identify the characteristics and processes of exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP.Analysis: Thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke, 1996) was employed to search for themes and patterns from the observations and interviews with physiotherapists and patients.Findings: The findings provide a complex understanding of how physiotherapists regard and utilise exercise based management strategies for patients with NSCLBP. Patient partnership and shared decision making were rarely evident and were linked to the physiotherapists clinical orientations, cognitive and decision making processes, and assumptions about patients. The overall feeling of the patients was that the role they played in the therapeutic interaction was a marginal one, such that the therapist was dominant in structuring the interactions, leaving the patients feeling disempowered to question and contribute.Conclusions: This research, by focusing on a patient-centred approach, makes an important contribution to the body of evidence relating to the management of NSCLBP. It challenges physiotherapists to critically appraise their approaches to the prescription of exercise therapy in order to improve outcomes in these patients.

AB  - A move towards self-management is central to health strategy around chronic low back pain, but its concept and meaning for those involved are poorly understood. In the reported study, four distinct and shared viewpoints on self-management were identified among people with pain and healthcare providers using Q methodology. Each construes self-management in a distinctive manner and articulates a different vision of change. Identification of similarities and differences among the viewpoints holds potential for enhancing communication between patients and healthcare providers and for better understanding the complexities of self-management in practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The culture of current clinical practice calls for collaboration between therapists and patients, sharing power and responsibility. This paper reports on the findings of a qualitative study of exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP, taking into account issues such as decision making and how this accords with patient preferences and experiences. OBJECTIVE: To understand the treatment decision making experiences, information and decision support needs of patients with NSCLBP who have been offered exercise as part of their management plan. DESIGN: A qualitative study using a philosophical hermeneutic approach. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with eight patients (including use of brief patient vignettes) was undertaken to explore their personal experiences of receiving exercise as part of the management of their NSCLBP, and their involvement in decisions regarding their care. FINDINGS: The findings provide a detailed insight into patients' perceptions and experiences of receiving exercise-based management strategies. Four themes were formed from the texts: (1) patients' expectations and patients' needs are not synonymous, (2) information is necessary but often not sufficient, (3) not all decisions need to be shared, and (4) wanting to be treated as an individual. CONCLUSIONS: Shared decision making did not appear to happen in physiotherapy clinical practice, but equally may not be what every patient wants. The overall feeling of the patients was that the therapist was dominant in structuring the interactions, leaving the patients feeling disempowered to question and contribute to the decision making.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The study objective was to understand how Chronic low back pain (CLBP) impacts key aging concepts such as retirement, housing, health, and independence. Research Design and Methods: Twenty-one pain clinic patients (66-83 years old) with CLBP engaged in 23 in-depth semistructured interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Guided by van Manen's phenomenological method, researchers used line-by-line thematic coding to analyze data through an iterative process. Results: Participants' accounts illustrate the interplay between aging and living with CLBP. Under the larger theme "Not so golden after all," results are reflected in five subthemes: (a) Falling apart; (b) Pain stigmatizes aging; (c) Hurting slowly, aging quickly; (d) Pain threatens independence; (e) The reality of unrealized futures. Discussion and Implications: This study improves our understanding of how CLBP complicates growing older with regard to tarnished retirements and stigmatization. Findings highlight the importance of coordinated care and recognition of pain-related loss.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent disabling condition among older adults, and treatment remains a challenge. Limited research has qualitatively examined late-life CLBP and its management. Study objective was to examine how older adults experience pain management approaches for CLBP. Guided by van Manen's phenomenological method, 21 pain clinic patients (66-83) completed semi-structured interviews. Under the main theme "Managing the incurable," four subthemes emerged: (a) A quest for relief; (b) Spinal procedures offer temporary relief yet ongoing disappointment; (c) The apprehension of medication (d) Making things work for me. Social work practice implications are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and the most common pain complaint among the rapidly growing older adult population. As part of a larger qualitative study examining the lived experience of CLBP among older adults, the objective of the present study is to understand how older pain clinic patients experience helplessness and also how they foster perseverance amid treatment-resistant CLBP. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using van Manen's phenomenological method, semistructured, in-depth, one-on-one interviews were conducted with 21 older pain clinic patients (aged 66-83) living with CLBP. Data were iteratively analyzed via line-by-line thematic coding. RESULTS: Findings dually illustrate how participants were living a battle between helplessness and perseverance; the final thematic structure revealed 5 subthemes: (a) Feeling helpless because nothing works; (b) Feeling down and depressed; (c) Distantly wishing for an end; (d) Accepting the reality of my pain; and (e) The pain stays, I keep going. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This study contributes a vivid illustration of older adults' CLBP illness experiences that are substantially underpinned by helplessness, depression, and a drive to continue thriving in old age. Practice implications include the need for clinic-based mood and suicide assessment.

AB  - AIM: To inform future research and exercise prescription for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), this study explored chiropractors' and chiropractic patients' experiences and beliefs regarding the barriers and facilitators to prescribed exercise adherence. METHODS: A focused ethnographic approach was used involving 16 semi-structured interviews, including pilot interviews (n = 4) followed by interviews with chiropractors (n = 6) and chiropractic patients with CLBP (n = 6). RESULTS: Barriers and facilitators to prescribed exercise adherence revolved around four themes: diagnostic and treatment beliefs motivating behavior, passive-active treatment balance, the therapeutic alliance and patient-centered care, and exercise delivery. CONCLUSION: Exercise adherence may be facilitated in patients with CLBP with simple exercise prescription changes made by chiropractors. However, changing chiropractors' and patients' diagnostic and treatment beliefs that are barriers to exercise adherence appears challenging. Training chiropractors in pain neuroscience education and the intentional use of behavior change techniques warrants future investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the experience of acupuncture care from the perspective of people with chronic low back pain. METHODS: A grounded theory, qualitative study using indepth interviews was undertaken with 11 people who had received acupuncture care for chronic low back pain. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Initial, focused and theoretical coding were used to identify a core category and several other categories. RESULTS: The core category, Reclaiming Control, was related to the sense of well-being experienced by most of the participants as a result of undergoing acupuncture care. The other categories were Gaining Sanctuary, Gaining Trust and Working Together. These categories reflected the processes of participants entering an aesthetically appealing, calm and relaxing space; developing confidence in the acupuncturists' ability to care for them; and negotiating strategies and sharing decision-making with acupuncturists about their care. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians using acupuncture as a management strategy for low back pain may elicit an immediate sense of calmness in patients with subsequent well-being benefits. A sense of calmness may also be enhanced through providing a relaxing physical environment. The transactional and interpersonal processes of establishing trust and rapport, and shared decision-making are important for clients. Shared decision-making can be improved by clinicians carefully considering the explanation of issues and plans to a particular patient, especially by developing an understanding of each patient's worldview and using language that the suits each individual's healthcare orientation. Our findings should be interpreted cautiously as the results may be generalisable only to private practice in affluent countries, and whether the findings are representative beyond this setting remains unclear.

AB  - This exploratory study investigated the dimensions of pain perceived by seven people with chronic low back pain of non-cancer origin. Using the technique of focus group discussions, the participants gave their perspectives on living with chronic pain. Transcripts from the groups were content analysed to give an Indication of the relative Importance of the emerging themes. The aspect of family/personal relationships emerged as an important theme, as did affect/emotions (both positive and negative), symptoms/features of pain, mobility, domestic activities and treatment. The extent to which these themes are currently being assessed by hearth professionals is briefly considered. Recommendations for further research are made.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low back pain (LBP) is a leading contributor to disability globally. Self-management is a core component of LBP management. We aimed to synthesise published qualitative literature concerning digital health interventions (DHIs) to support LBP self-management to: (1) determine engagement strategies, (2) identify barriers and facilitators affecting patient uptake/utilisation and (3) develop a preliminary conceptual model of barriers and facilitators to uptake/utilisation. DESIGN: Systematic review following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, DoPHER, TRoPHI, Web of Science and OT Seeker, from January 2000 to December 2018, using the concepts: LBP, DHI and self-management. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Peer-reviewed qualitative study (or component) examining engagement with, or barriers and/or facilitators to the uptake/utilisation of an interactive DHI for self-management of LBP in adults (community, primary or secondary care settings). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Standardised data extraction form was completed. COREQ (Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research) checklist was used to assess methodology. Data was synthesised narratively for engagement strategies, thematically for barriers/facilitators to uptake/utilisation and normalisation process theory was applied to produce a conceptual model. RESULTS: We identified 14 191 citations, of which 105 full-text articles were screened, and five full-text articles from four studies included. These were from community and primary care contexts in Europe and the USA, and involved 56 adults with LBP and 19 healthcare professionals. There was a lack of consideration on how to sustain engagement with DHIs. Examination of barriers and facilitators for uptake/utilisation identified four major themes: IT (information technology) usability-accessibility; quality-quantity of content; tailoring-personalisation; and motivation-support. These themes informed the development of a preliminary conceptual model for uptake/utilisation of a DHI for LBP self-management. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight key barriers and facilitators that should be considered when designing DHIs for LBP self-management. Our findings are in keeping with reviews of DHIs for other long-term conditions, implying these findings may not be condition specific. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: A protocol for this systematic review was registered with https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (CRD42016051182) on 10 November 2016. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?ID=CRD42016051182.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It remains unclear as to what factors influence a patient's choice to seek care from a specific healthcare provider for low back and neck pain. OBJECTIVE: Utilize Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilization as a conceptual framework to identify the predisposing, enabling and need factors associated with choice of healthcare provider for back and/or neck pain. METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies that included 1) patients seeking care for acute or chronic low back or neck pain; 2) patients at least 18 years of age; 3) reported any healthcare provider type chosen to be seen. Significant factors addressing a patient's choice of provider seen for back pain, neck pain, or both were extracted from studies and analyzed under the Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilization. RESULTS: 20 studies were included in this review: 17 quantitative studies and 3 qualitative studies. Provider types identified were medical physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, acupuncturists and CAM providers. Age and sex were the most commonly reported predisposing factors; financial and personal factors were the most common enabling factors; patients' duration of pain and self-reported level of functioning were the most commonly reported need factors. CONCLUSIONS: While predisposing and need factors are important, enabling factors also have an influence in choice of healthcare provider for back and/or neck pain.

AB  - Introduction. Older adults with chronic pain who seek treatment often are in a health care environment that emphasizes patient-directed care, a change from the patriarchal model of care to which many older adults are accustomed.\n\nObjective. To explore the experiences of older adults seeking treatment for chronic pain, with respect to patient-directed care and the patient–provider relationship.\n\nDesign. In-depth interviews with 15 Caucasian older adults with chronic pain who had been evaluated at a university-based pain clinic. All interviews were audiotaped and the transcripts were analyzed using a grounded theory based approach.\n\nResults. Older adults with chronic pain vary in their willingness to be involved in their treatment decisions. Many frequently participate in decisions about their pain treatment by asking for or refusing specific treatments, demanding quality care, or operating outside of the patient–provider relationship to manage pain on their own. However, others prefer to let their provider make the decisions. In either case, having a mutually respectful patient–provider relationship is important to this population. Specifically, participants described the importance of “being heard” and “being understood” by providers.\n\nConclusions. As some providers switch from a patriarchal model of care toward a model of care that emphasizes patient activation and patient-centeredness, the development and cultivation of valued patient–provider relationships may change. While it is important to encourage patient involvement in treatment decisions, high-quality, patient-centered care for older adults with chronic pain should include efforts to strengthen the patient–provider relationship by attending to differences in patients\u0027 willingness to engage in patient-directed care and emphasizing shared decision-making.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the differences in narrative between patients with persistent non-specific low back pain (PLBP) who benefited from a pain management programme, and those who did not benefit. METHOD: We conducted interviews with 20 patients attending a pain management programme; prior to attending the programme, immediately following the programme and at one year. Our analysis focused on a theoretical sample of patients who either described dramatic life improvements at one year, and who described themselves as much worse. We used the methods of grounded theory. RESULTS: We found that finding hope was central to good outcome. Patients restored hope by making certain changes; (a) deconstructing specific fears, (b) constructing an acceptable explanatory model (c) reconstructing self identity by making acceptable changes. Those who had not restored hope retained fears of loss of self, remained committed to the biomedical model and were unable to make acceptable changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may help to operationalise the restoration of hope in patients with PLBP. Firstly, health care professionals need to identify and resolve any specific fears of movement. Secondly, patients need an acceptable explanatory model that fits their experience and personal narrative. Finally our study confirms the centrality of self concept to recovery.

AB  - AIM: This paper aims to present a conceptual analysis of patients' experience of general practice in relation to their persistent non-specific low back pain (PLBP). BACKGROUND: PLBP accounts for a considerable amount of the daily workload of the general practitioner (GP). GPs need to maintain a good relationship with their patient while following guidelines for best practice. The biomedical model can contribute to the tensions experienced by a person with PLBP and a shift in the prevailing model may facilitate the resolution of these tensions. Qualitative research can help clinicians to understand this process and thus facilitate the best possible outcome. METHOD: We conducted a series of three in-depth interviews over a period of one year with 20 patients with PLBP who had been invited to attend a pain management programme. We used the methods of constructivist grounded theory to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Several themes emerged that provide a deeper understanding of the context in which patient and GP negotiate their relationship. Patients describe how they have been fobbed off by a GP who is just a general practitioner and not an expert. This allowed patients to continue to use the biomedical model; I have something real but the GP lacks knowledge. To think that 'nothing can be done', would involve accepting the limits of medical knowledge. We also found that over time, as diagnosis and cure is not achieved, patient began to question the concept of the medical expert. This tension opens up the possibility for a shift away from the biomedical towards a biopsychosocial explanatory model.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore and compare the perceptions of patients and primary healthcare professionals regarding the management of chronic low back pain. METHODS: Qualitative study using 26 semi-structured individual interviews, and one discussion group, carried out in primary care in Lleida, Spain. RESULTS: Patients and primary healthcare professionals both had assumptions pertaining to: (1) the diagnosis and meaning of chronic low back pain, (2) expectations regarding treatment for pain reduction, and (3) communication between primary healthcare professionals and patients with chronic low back pain. Results suggest a mutual dissatisfaction with the diagnosis of chronic low back pain and a lack of understanding between primary healthcare professionals and patients. Some contradictions between them were also noted: the patients wanted quick solutions to reduce their pain, but the primary healthcare professionals required an accurate etiology to prescribe treatment, and the patients did not always follow the primary healthcare professionals' recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosing and treating chronic low back pain is compromised due to differing expectations and the communication barriers that exist between healthcare professionals and their patients. Primary healthcare professionals should be aware of the power of their explanations and recommendations to patients. Implications for Rehabilitation Primary healthcare professionals should negotiate treatments with patients and adapt them to their individual needs, according to a Patient-Centered approach and the biopsychosocial model of pain.Primary healthcare professionals should explain to patients the underlying mechanisms and multifactorial nature of chronic low back pain.Primary healthcare professional-patient communication needs to be improved to help patients to better understand their chronic condition. The healthcare professionals in Spain should be more trained into the (bio)psychosocial model of long-term pain, stop searching for non-evident pathologies and change their biomedical beliefs.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies. OBJECTIVES: To summarize evidence from studies among patients with low back pain on their expectations and satisfaction with treatment as part of practice guideline development. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients are often dissatisfied with treatment for acute or chronic back pain. METHODS: We searched the literature for studies on patient expectations and satisfaction with treatment for low back pain. Treatment aspects related to expectations or satisfaction were identified in qualitative studies. Percentages of dissatisfied patients were calculated from quantitative studies. RESULTS: Twelve qualitative and eight quantitative studies were found. Qualitative studies revealed the following aspects that patient expectation from treatment for back pain or with which they are dissatisfied. Patients want a clear diagnosis of the cause of their pain, information and instructions, pain relief, and a physical examination. Next, expectations are that there are more diagnostic tests, other therapy or referrals to specialists, and sickness certification. They expect confirmation from the healthcare provider that their pain is real. Like other patients, they want a confidence-based association that includes understanding, listening, respect, and being included in decision-making. The results from qualitative studies are confirmed by quantitative studies. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have explicit expectations on diagnosis, instructions, and interpersonal management. New strategies need to be developed in order to meet patients' expectations better. Practice guidelines should pay more attention to the best way of discussing the causes and diagnosis with the patient and should involve them in the decision-making process. [References: 60]

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study responded to the need for greater understanding of the experiences that help to shape the worldviews of chronic back patients as they seek help from pain clinics. AIM: To elaborate on the lived experience of chronic back pain in those actively seeking help from pain clinics. METHODS: This was a qualitative study, based on an interpretative phenomenological approach. As part of in-depth interviews, participants were invited to 'tell their story' from the time their pain began. Participants were twelve male and eight female patients, all of whom were diagnosed as having chronic benign back pain and had recently attended one of two pain clinics as new referrals. The data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: Loss was one of five major themes to emerge. The narrative accounts revealed a catalogue of socio-economic and other material losses including loss of physical and mental abilities, occupational and social activities, job or role. In those of working age, these led to financial hardship and changes in interpersonal relationships, culminating in loss of self-worth, future and hope. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that material losses, as well as perceptions of loss, are prominent issues for those of working age seeking help from pain clinics for chronic back pain, and may need to be acknowledged and addressed as part of therapeutic interventions. The possibility of age-related differences in pain-related loss may be worthy of further investigation.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper was to uncover and understand the reality of living with chronic, intractable non malignant back pain, as it is understood by sufferers themselves. A narrative auto-ethnographic research design was chosen, enabling interaction with five participants during the interview process, as well as providing the opportunity to further explore one of the researcher's experiences as a long time sufferer of chronic, intractable non malignant back pain.Thematic analysis of participant interviews, and a deep, introspective scrutiny of the researcher's journey, resulted in five stories being written reflecting the experiences of the researcher and the five participants. This paper presents one story, 'Walk a mile in my shoes'. It is written in the form of a letter to health professionals such as doctors and nurses in order that they may better understand the lives of chronic non malignant pain sufferers with a view to improving the care they provide when these patients are admitted to hospital.Issues identified include struggling with unremitting pain, loss of relationships and a fulfilling social life, as well as dealing with suspicion, labelling and stigmatising by nurses and the community at large.

AB  - This paper examines the role of an interactive website--named Oneself--on patients' chronic low back pain self-management in the Italian part of Switzerland. As part of a qualitative evaluation, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 18 Oneself users. Results confirm that the Internet may promote attitudes and behaviors of self-management of chronic low back pain. However, it seems that individuals take advantage of this means differently, based on their profile (age, familiarization with the web) and stage of advancement in the self-management process. We conclude that information and support provided online should be tailored according to these different criteria.

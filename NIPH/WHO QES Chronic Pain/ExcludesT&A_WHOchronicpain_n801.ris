AB  - This study examined the relationship between perceived (stated) levels of function and the measured (observed) performance in squatting and stair climbing activities of 20 patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and 20 healthy volunteers. Subjects were asked through an interview to self-assess their ability to comfortably perform stair climbing and squatting as well as other tolerances. The subjects were then asked to perform the activities and their performance levels were recorded. Results revealed that patients' estimate of squatting and stair climbing abilities as well as their demonstrated levels were significantly lower (p<0.001) than those of the healthy subjects. There was a significant difference between groups in terms of the time required to perform squatting but not stair climbing. Both groups underestimated their physical capabilities. Findings indicate that the use of actual performance measurement combined with self-report of functional abilities is needed when assessing performance levels of healthy subjects as well as patients with CLBP.

AB  - This guidance document reviews the epidemiology and management of pain in older people via a literature review of published research. The aim of this document is to inform health professionals in any care setting who work with older adults on best practice for the management of pain and to identify where there are gaps in the evidence that require further research. The assessment of pain in older people has not been covered within this guidance and can be found in a separate document (http://www.britishpainsociety.org/pub_professional.htm#assessmentpop). Substantial differences in the population, methods and definitions used in published research makes it difficult to compare across studies and impossible to determine the definitive prevalence of pain in older people. There are inconsistencies within the literature as to whether or not pain increases or decreases in this age group, and whether this is influenced by gender. There is, however, some evidence that the prevalence of pain is higher within residential care settings. The three most common sites of pain in older people are the back; leg/knee or hip and \u0027other\u0027 joints. In common with the working-age population, the attitudes and beliefs of older people influence all aspects of their pain experience. Stoicism is particularly evident within this cohort of people. Evidence from the literature search suggests that paracetamol should be considered as first-line treatment for the management of both acute and persistent pain, particularly that which is of musculoskeletal origin, due to its demonstrated efficacy and good safety profile. There are few absolute contraindications and relative cautions to prescribing paracetamol. It is, however, important that the maximum daily dose (4 g/24 h) is not exceeded. Non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution in older people after other safer treatments have not provided sufficient pain relief. The lowest dose should be provided, for the shortest duration. For older adults, an NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor should be co-prescribed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and the one with the lowest acquisition cost should be chosen. All older people taking NSAIDs should be routinely monitored for gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular side effects, and drug–drug and drug–disease interactions. Opioid therapy may be considered for patients with moderate or severe pain, particularly if the pain is causing functional impairment or is reducing their quality of life. However, this must be individualised and carefully monitored. Opioid side effects including nausea and vomiting should be anticipated and suitable prophylaxis considered. Appropriate laxative therapy, such as the combination of a stool softener and a stimulant laxative, should be prescribed throughout treatment for all older people who are prescribed opioid therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants and anti-epileptic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in several types of neuropathic pain. But, tolerability and adverse effects limit their use in an older population. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections in osteoarthritis of the knee are effective in relieving pain in the short term, with little risk of complications and/or joint damage. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid is effective and free of systemic adverse effects. It should be considered in patients who are intolerant to systemic therapy. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid appears to have a slower onset of action than intra-articular steroids, but the effects seem to last longer. The current evidence for the use of epidural steroid injections in the management of sciatica is conflicting and, until further larger studies become available, no firm recommendations can be made. There is, however, a limited body of evidence to support the use of epidural injections in spinal stenosis. The literature review suggests that assistive devices are widely used and that the ownership of devices increases with age. Such devices enable older people with chronic pain to live in the community. However, they do not necessarily reduce pain and can increase pain if used incorrectly. Increasing activity by way of exercise should be considered. This should involve strengthening, flexibility, endurance and balance, along with a programme of education. Patient preference should be given serious consideration. A number of complementary therapies have been found to have some efficacy among the older population, including acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and massage. Such approaches can affect pain and anxiety and are worth further investigation. Some psychological approaches have been found to be useful for the older population, including guided imagery, biofeedback training and relaxation. There is also some evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) among nursing home populations, but of course these approaches require training and time. There are many areas that require further research, including pharmacological management where approaches are often tested in younger populations and then translated across. Prevalence studies need consistency in terms of age, diagnosis and terminology, and further work needs to be done on evaluating non-pharmacological approaches.

AB  - Background Collaboration with patients in healthcare and medical research is an emerging development. We aimed to develop a methodology for health research agenda setting processes grounded in the notion of participation as dialogue. Methods We conducted seven case studies between 2003 and 2007 to develop and validate a Dialogue Model for patient participation in health research agenda setting. The case studies related to spinal cord injury, neuromuscular diseases, renal failure, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, burns, diabetes and intellectual disabilities. Results The Dialogue Model is grounded in participatory and interactive approaches and has been adjusted on the basis of pilot work. It has six phases: exploration; consultation; prioritization; integration; programming; and implementation. These phases are discussed and illustrated with a case description of research agenda setting relating to burns. Conclusions The dialogue model appeared relevant and feasible to structure the process of collaboration between stakeholders in several research agenda setting processes. The phase of consultation enables patients to develop their own voice and agenda, and prepares them for the broader collaboration with other stakeholder groups. Challenges include the stimulation of more permanent changes in research, and institutional transitions.

AB  - Living with daily pain during a long period of time is a considerable strain which affects many aspects of life. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and coping strategies of patients with chronic low back pain. A strategic sample of 22 patients with chronic low back pain were interviewed according to a semistructured qualitative method: 14 women and eight men, with a mean age of 46 and a mean duration of illness of 15 years. 18 had been treated with low back surgery. All patients had pain every day. 19 were never without pain. They reported disturbed sleep, irritable mood and depression; 15 had thought of suicide. They felt constantly worn out. The pain influenced their everyday life and their total situation. The lives of patients with intermittent daily pain were less affected. The patients were asked what advice they would give to others in a similar situation. Their main point was not to give up, to focus less on the pain and the limitations and more on everything that could bring dedication and joy to everyday life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diminished tactile acuity in chronic non-neuropathic pain syndromes has been attributed to central pain processing and cortical reorganization. The latter was recently targeted in clinical trials that demonstrated no clear advantages over traditional approaches for the reduction of nonspecific low back pain (LBP). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the current evidence on tactile acuity in LBP and pain-free controls. METHODS: Six databases were independently searched by 2 researchers. Nineteen studies with either case-control, cross-sectional, or baseline lumbar tactile acuity data collected before an intervention were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. All pooled analyses were based on random effects models. Risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black scale and selection criteria were verified independently by 2 assessors. RESULTS: Data on patients (n=547) and controls (n=346) were summarized. Studies on patients included data on nonspecific chronic LBP only; no data on acute LBP were identified. There was a significant mean difference between patients and controls for lumbar tactile acuity including (11.74 mm; 95% confidence interval, 8.61-14.87) and excluding (9.49 mm; 95% confidence interval, 3.64-15.34) higher risk of bias studies. DISCUSSION: A gap of knowledge regarding tactile acuity in populations with acute and chronic non-neuropathic LBP needs to be addressed in future research as this may significantly help the understanding of the causality of tactile acuity alterations.

AB  - The relationship between videotape ratings of pain behavior and the flexion-relaxation phenomenon was evaluated in a sample of 39 chronic low-back pain patients. The results showed that guarded movement explained approximately 27% of the variability in the flexion-relaxation phenomenon, adjusting for pain intensity rating. There were no significant differences in sex observed. It is recommended that clinicians pay close attention to qualitative aspects of patient behavior to improve the sensitivity of the physical examination in detecting bona fide impairment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients' pain behavior plays an important role in the interaction between patients and their partners, as acknowledged in operant models of pain. However, despite the considerable research attention to pain behaviors, the underlying motives of such behaviors are still unclear. The current study explores the motives to engage in pain behaviors and the possible discrepancies between individuals experiencing pain and partners' perceptions of those motives. METHODS: A qualitative study was performed, comprising semistructured interviews with 27 patients with chronic low back pain and their partners. They were recruited through purposive sampling at 2 pain clinics located in Tehran, Iran. RESULTS: Patients and partners mentioned a variety of motives for pain behaviors, including protecting oneself against more pain, regulating negative emotions, informing others about the pain severity, seeking validation or intimacy, gaining advantages from pain, and expressing anger. Patients and partners revealed the most similarities in motives such as protecting oneself against more pain and informing others about the pain severity. However, partners rarely acknowledged patients' motives for seeking validation and they were more likely to mention negative motives (eg, expressing anger). DISCUSSION: In conclusion, partners are more likely to attribute negative motives to the patient's pain behaviors, which may lead to their hostility toward patients. The findings of this study provide new insights into motives of pain behaviors from the perspective of patients and partners, which can inform couple-based interventions in terms of effective pain communication.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Partner's responses to pain behaviours play a pivotal role in the patient's adjustment. This study aims to further our knowledge regarding patients' and partners' interpretation of partners' responses to pain behaviours, and the possible discrepancies between patients' and partners' perceptions. Further, this study examines patients' preferred responses to pain behaviours and possible discrepancies between received and preferred responses to pain behaviours. DESIGN: A qualitative research design based on a semi-structured in-depth interview. METHODS: Patients with chronic low back pain and their partners (n = 54) were recruited through purposive sampling and interviewed. Data were analysed based on an inductive analytic approach. RESULTS: Patients as well as partners indicated a number of different interpretations of partners' responses to pain behaviours, including invalidation, relieving pain, validation, encouragement, caregiving exhaustion, and expressing resentment. Patients and partners revealed similarities in the interpretation of response categories that they associated with validation, invalidation, and expressing resentment. Discrepancies between patients and partners indicated that partners interpreted some responses as caused by caregiving exhaustion while patients did not. Patients perceived partner responses that included the active involvement of the partner (e.g., encouraging pain talk) more positively than responses that showed less active involvement of the partner. CONCLUSION: Patients and partners are likely to make various interpretations of a certain partner response to pain behaviours. Our findings underscore that patients' interpretation about a certain behaviour might determine whether that behaviour is rated as desirable or aversive.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic low back pain can contribute to a global socioeconomic burden. Current international recommendations emphasize that low back pain management should occur at the primary-care level. However, there is a lack of essential services for low back pain management at the primary-care level in Saudi Arabia. We explored the current state of low back pain management in Saudi Arabia from the perspective of spine surgeons and physiotherapists. METHODS: A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted on spine surgeons and physiotherapists. A total of 17 healthcare workers, 8 spine surgeons (age range 28-49 years) and 9 physiotherapists (age range 30-49 years) participated in the study. Data were recorded and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified from the interview data that outlined current low back pain management in Saudi Arabia: clinical guideline availability and pathways of care, utilization of primary care services, and overutilization of secondary care resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests underutilization of primary care services and overutilization of secondary care services in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the implementation of local clinical guidelines could improve patient care as well as reduce the cost of low back pain management.

AB  - Job retention services are recommended for people with chronic diseases based on their high risk for work disability. This randomized trial tested the effectiveness of a job retention intervention in a sample of employed persons with rheumatic diseases at risk for work disability. One hundred and twenty-two experimental participants received the job retention intervention, and 120 controls received written materials. Employment status was assessed at 6-month intervals up to 48 months after enrollment. Main outcomes were time to job loss and satisfaction with the experimental and control interventions. The log-rank test was used to detect a difference between the groups in time to job loss. Between-group differences in satisfaction scores were analyzed using Wilcoxon tests. Job loss was delayed in experimental participants compared with controls, p = 0.03. Satisfaction scores for the job retention intervention were substantially higher than those for the written materials, p < 0.0001. Job retention intervention has the potential to reduce the high rates of chronic disease-associated job loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rehospitalization rates resulting from secondary conditions in persons with spinal cord injuries (SCI) are high. Self-management programs for many chronic conditions have been associated with decreases in hospital readmissions. However, in the SCI community, evidence suggests that satisfaction with traditional self-management programs is low. Users with SCI have indicated preference for programs that are online (rather than in-person), that target SCI-specific concerns, and are led by peers with SCI. There is currently no program with all of these features, which addresses self-management of secondary conditions after SCI. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide details of a participatory design (PD) process for an internet-mediated self-management program for users with SCI (called SCI & U) and illustrate how it has been used to define design constraints and solutions. METHODS: Users were involved in development as codesigners, codevelopers, and key informants. Codesigners and codevelopers were recruited from consumer advocacy groups and worked with a core development team. Key informants were recruited from geographically distributed advocacy groups to form a product advisory council that met regularly with the core team. During meetings, codesigners and informants walked through stages of work that typify PD processes such as exploration, discovery, and prototyping. This paper details the process by analyzing 10 meetings that took place between August 2015 and May 2016. Meetings were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to an inductive thematic analysis; resulting themes were organized according to their relationship to PD stages. RESULTS: A total of 16 individuals participated in meeting discussions, including 7 researchers and 9 persons with SCI from 4 Canadian provinces. Themes of trust, expertise, and community emerged in every group discussion. The exploration stage revealed interest in online self-management resources coupled with concerns about information credibility. In general, participants indicated that they felt more confident with information received from trusted, in-person sources (eg, peers or health care professionals) than information found online. The discovery stage saw participants propose and discuss concepts to filter credible information and highlight community expertise, namely (1) a community-curated resource database, (2) online information navigators, and (3) group chats with peers. Several tools and techniques were collectively prototyped in an effort to foster trust and community; these are illustrated in the Results section. CONCLUSIONS: A PD process engaging users as codesigners, codevelopers, and informants can be used to identify design concerns and prototype online solutions to promote self-management after SCI. Future work will assess the usability of the collectively designed tools among a broad population of Canadians with SCI and the tools' impact on self-efficacy and health.

AB  - Life care planning is a specialty area of practice that relies upon a multidisciplinary approach to case analysis and comprehensive plan development. This area evolved as a tool of case management and has applications within a variety of industries and disciplines including private and government health insurance, disability management, home and facility-based health care, vocational rehabilitation, psychological counseling, durable medical equipment and assistive technology, and personal injury litigation. Life care planning methodology utilizes evidence-based standards of care, clinical practice guidelines, published research, and recommendations from members of a client's treatment team to identify long-term medical and rehabilitation needs for individuals with catastrophic injuries and chronic health conditions. Plan recommendations are based upon the unique needs of each individual and their anticipated needs over time. Associated costs of all plan recommendations are based upon the fees charged by service providers and vendors within the individual's local community or geographic region, and they are projected over the course of his or her life expectancy.The purpose of the present study was to describe the outcomes experienced by individuals with spinal cord injuries for whom life care plans were developed. An exploratory qualitative case study approach involving semi-structured, in-depth interviews allowed investigators to describe emergent themes and to assess the consistency between current self-reported needs and those that were projected in each participant's life care plan. Seven individuals participated in the study.Themes that emerged from participant interview included: the importance of maintaining independence, health, pre-injury goals, and a positive outlook; fear of future health problems and further physical limitations; frustration with the health insurance claims process; the need for case management support; and the role of professionals in litigated cases.In considering the consistency between current and projected needs, plan recommendations regarding personal assistance were not applicable in three cases because the participants are not yet of the age when such services were projected to begin. In three cases, participants reported requiring fewer hours of personal assistance than was projected in their life care plans. In one case, the participant receives 24 hour attendant care and has so since the time of the injury. The continued need for such care was accurately projected in the life care plan.With regard to medical care, each plan demonstrated areas where projections were consistent with current needs and areas where projections were inconsistent. Interpretation of these findings is limited by the lack of access to each participant's recent medical and rehabilitation records, and the inability to interview the primary care physicians who are currently directing their medical care.Given the emergent themes, post-injury outcomes, and unexpected findings revealed in the present study, an educational initiative focused upon informing clients of the value and utility of their individualized life care plan appears necessary. Investigators discuss the implications of the findings, challenges in conducting research within the specialty, and suggest directions for future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A positive relationship between flat feet and low back pain (LBP) has not gained consensus in literature. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and factors associated with low back pain (acute and chronic) among individuals with flat feet. METHODS: In 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted at a national festival in Saudi Arabia, and 1798 adult visitors were invited to participate in face-to-face interviews. Participants ' characteristics were stratified by the type of foot and they were questioned on acute low back pain (ALBP) or chronic low back pain (CLBP). The odds ratio (OR) were presented as a measure of this association, followed by a multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of LBP among participants with flat feet was 65.9%, among whom 51.6% suffered ALBP and 48.4% suffered from CLBP. Flat feet increased the chances of having ALBP by 3.28 times and CLBP by 4.5 times. After stratification, ALBP and CLBP were both significantly higher among all participants with flat feet in comparison with their counter groups. Multivariate analyses showed that females were more likely to complain of ALBP. Participants who did no physical activity were more likely to complain of ALBP. Female participants and older participants were more likely to complain of ALBP and CLBP. CONCLUSION: Flat feet are associated with both ALBP and CLBP. Significant factors of low back pain also included sex, age, occupation, and physical activity.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the effects of physical therapy modalities five days a week versus twice a week with a three-day interval on pain, depression, and functional disability in patients with chronic mechanical low back pain. Patients and methods: Between June 2018 and November 2018, a total of 60 patients (39 females, 21 males; mean age 41.0±6.8 years; range, 25 to 55 years) with chronic mechanical low back pain were included. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=30) received physical therapy five days a week for a total of 15 sessions, while Group 2 (n=30) received physical therapy twice a week with a three-day interval for a total of six sessions. Per protocol, all patients were applied hot pack for 20 min, followed by conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for 20 min and therapeutic ultrasound (US) for 10 min in each session. All patients were given exercise training and were instructed to do twice a day up to four weeks after the completion of physical therapy sessions. The severity of low back pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS), the severity of depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and functional disability using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). All patients were evaluated before and after physical therapy and at four weeks. The results were compared between the groups. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the age, gender, body mass index, occupation, VAS, BDI, and ODI scores at the time of randomization (p>0.05). Intra-group analysis showed a significant improvement in all parameters after physical therapy compared to pre-treatment values and at four weeks compared to the post-treatment values (p<0.001). The differences of changes were used for the intergroup analysis which revealed a difference of change in favor of improvement was significantly higher in Group 2 than Group 1 (p<0.001). There was no significant difference between the post-treatment values and values at four weeks (p>0.05). Conclusion: Our study results suggest that both physical therapy modalities applied five days week and twice a week are effective in pain, depression, and functional disability. However, physical therapy protocol applied twice a week yields more improvement, indicating that it is more advantageous with less cost and lost workdays.

AB  - Study Objective: Surgical trauma is known to induce hyperalgesia, and if pain management is insufficient, it contributes to persistent pain in the postoperative period.In this study, our primary aims were to compare the effect of pregabalin and duloxetine on postoperative pain scores and cognitive functions. Our secondary aim was to determine drug-related side effects.Design: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.Settings: The study was carried out in the setting of the operating room and the surgical ward.Patients: Ninety-four patients, 18 to 65 years of age, ASA status I-II, scheduled for elective repair of lumbar disc herniation were enrolled in the study.Interventions: The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: the first group received pregabalin 75 mg orally 1 hour before the surgery and at the postoperative 12th and 24th hours. The second group received duloxetine 60 mg orally 1 hour before the surgery. At the postoperative 12th hour, they received a placebo capsule, and, at the 24th hour, they received duloxetine 60 mg again. The third group received placebo capsules orally at all timepoints.Measurements: Postoperative pain evaluation was conducted using a Visual Analogue Scale at the postoperative first minute, 30th minute, first hour, and the 12th, 24th, and 48th hours. The preoperative and postoperative sixth hour cognitive functions were evaluated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.Main Results: There was a significant reduction in mean MoCA scores postoperatively in all groups (P<0.01). The highest MoCA score reduction was in the pregabalin group (1.83±1.31 point), then in the duloxetine group (1.16±0.82), and the least decrease was in the control group (0.49±0.61). At all timepoints, the mean Visual Analogue Scale scores of the pregabalin and duloxetine groups were similar to each other, and they were lower than that of the control group (P<0.05).Conclusions: Preoperative use of duloxetine 60 mg can be an useful alternative to pregabalin 75 mg, as it has a similar analgesic effect on postoperative pain, with fewer incidences of drug-related negative effects on cognitive function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health applications can offer tailored self-management support to individuals living with chronic health conditions. However, there are several challenges to the adoption of these technologies in practice. Co-design is a promising approach to overcoming some of these challenges by enabling the development of solutions that meet the actual needs and preferences of the relevant stakeholder groups. OBJECTIVE: Taking spinal cord injury as a case in point, the overall objectives of this study were to identify the perceived benefits of a co-designed self-management app that could promote its uptake and to explore the factors that may impede adoption. METHODS: We adopted a qualitative research approach guided by the Technology Acceptance Model. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with individuals with spinal cord injury (n=15) and two focus groups with health care professionals specialized in spinal cord injury (n=7, n=5). Prior to the interviews and focus groups, study participants were given time to explore the app prototype. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Findings of our analysis indicate that study participants perceived the app prototype as potentially useful for supporting individuals with spinal cord injury in preventing pressure injuries. In particular, we identified three concrete use cases highlighting the benefits of the app for different audiences: (1) a companion for newly injured individuals, (2) an emergency kit and motivational support, and 3) a guide for informal caregivers and family members. We also uncovered several challenges that might impede the adoption of the self-management app in practice, including (1) challenges in motivating individuals to use the app, (2) concerns about the misuse and abuse of the app, and (3) organizational and maintenance challenges. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to a growing body of research that investigates individuals' adoption and nonadoption behavior regarding mobile health solutions. Building on earlier work, we make recommendations on how to address the barriers to the adoption of mobile health solutions identified by this study. In particular, there is a need to foster trust in mobile health among prospective users, including both patients and health care professionals. Moreover, increasing personal relevance of mobile health solutions through personalization may be a promising approach to promote uptake. Last but not least, organizational support also plays an instrumental role in mobile health adoption. We conclude that even though co-design is promoted as a promising approach to develop self-management tools, co-design does not guarantee adoption. More research is needed to identify the most promising strategies to promote the adoption of evidence-based mobile health solutions in practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that chiropractors continue to widely use radiography for assessing patients with acute low back pain. This practice is contrary to growing evidence that suggests only a small percentage of patients with acute low back pain require radiographic evaluation. OBJECTIVES: To assess quantitatively and qualitatively the views of chiropractors in a selected community in Ontario on the use of radiography for evaluating patients with acute low back pain. Study Design: Mailed surveys and focus group interview. METHOD: Surveys were mailed to all chiropractors (N = 26) in a selected community in Ontario, followed by a focus group session with local chiropractors (n = 7). Surveys requested information on personal and practice characteristics and the management of low back pain, including the use of radiography. The focus group, led by a facilitator, discussed issues surrounding practice guidelines and radiography use. RESULTS: There was a 76% response rate to the mailed surveys. Of those who responded, 63% stated they would use radiography on patients with uncomplicated acute low back pain lasting 1 week; 68% stated that radiographs were useful in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with acute low back pain lasting less than 1 month. Most reasons given for use of radiography in this patient population are not supported by existing evidence. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be a high rate of radiographic use by chiropractors in the study community, which is consistent with findings in previous studies. Many of the reasons given for use of radiography are not supported by existing evidence and may contribute to the gap between current chiropractic practice and available evidence with respect to use of radiography for acute low back pain.

AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder affecting populations from both low- and middle-income, and high-income countries. Global prevalence of LBP is estimated at 9.4% with prevalence rates substantially higher in low- and middle-income countries notably in Africa (39%). The recommended biopsychosocial model of managing patients with LBP, has been predominantly applied and evaluated in high-income countries, therefore, it is essential to ascertain the feasibility of implementing this approach in low- and middle-income countries including Ghana. To investigate the feasibility of implementing a biopsychosocial physiotherapy management approach (exercise and patient education) for the management of patients with chronic LBP in Ghana. Context: Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Ghana. Mixed-methods, sequential, feasibility, pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study. Physiotherapists will be recruited and trained to deliver the biopsychosocial intervention, followed by recruitment of patients with CLBP. Assessment of outcome measures will be conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-months, focusing on feasibility outcomes including recruitment rate, retention rate, and acceptability of the intervention. Patient demographics and secondary outcomes measures will also be collected. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the outcomes data and assess feasibility against a priori feasibility criteria. Finally, qualitative interviews will be conducted to explore participants' experiences and acceptance through thematic analysis. This study will investigate the feasibility of implementing a biopsychosocial physiotherapy management approach for patients with CLBP in Ghana. The outcomes will assess the feasibility of the intervention, the appropriateness of outcome measures and inform a future clinical trial.

AB  - Introduction: Low back pain is one of the leading causes of disability globally. Most back pain episodes resolve quickly but a significant number of people report having back pain that lasts more than 3 months. The current understanding is that persistent low back pain (PLBP) is a complex presentation requiring a multidimensional approach. This is reflected in the evolution from a biomedical to a psychosocial model of care in physiotherapy. This approach has proven to be a challenge for physiotherapists. Objectives: To explore the physiotherapists' experience of managing persons with persistent low back pain. Methods: The study employed a qualitative approach drawing on Interpretative Phenomenology. The aim was to seek understanding through the exploration of the physiotherapists' personal experience of managing persons with persistent low back pain (PLBP). Four physiotherapists were interviewed through semi-structured interviews to acquire an example of their experience of managing persons with PLBP. The data was analysed using Thematic Analysis. Results: Four master themes were generated as a result of the analysis of the clinicians' descriptions: Managing complexity in persons with PLBP, negotiation with the person, person - physiotherapist relationship and management strategies. Conclusion: The clinicians described the complexity of managing persons with PLBP. They described management strategies that align with the NICE 2016 guidelines. They conveyed the belief that the person should be in control and described their role as being supportive in the therapeutic process. Finally they described behaviours they felt helped in forming a therapeutic alliance. These findings offer further insights into the physiotherapists' experience of managing persons with PLBP.

AB  - Objective  To determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a peer mentorship intervention to improve self-management of osteoarthritis (OA).  Design  Six-month parallel group non-blinded randomised feasibility trial.  Setting  One secondary care and one primary care UK National Health Service Trust.  Participants  Fifty adults aged ≥55 years old with hip and/or knee OA.  Interventions  Participants were allocated 1:1 to the intervention or control group using an online randomisation service. Intervention group participants received usual care (information resources) and up to eight community-based self-management support sessions delivered by a peer mentor (trained volunteer with hip and/or knee OA). Control group participants received usual care only.  Outcome measures  Key feasibility outcomes were participant and peer mentor recruitment and attrition, intervention completion and the sample size required for a definitive RCT. Based on these feasibility outcomes, four success criteria for proceeding to a definitive RCT were prespecified. Patient-reported outcomes were collected via questionnaires at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months.  Results  Ninety-six individuals were screened, 65 were eligible and 50 were randomised (25 per group). Of the 24 participants who commenced the intervention, 20 completed it. Four participants did not complete the 6-month questionnaire. Twenty-one individuals were eligible for the peer mentor role, 15 were trained and 5 withdrew prior to being matched with a participant. No intervention-related harms occurred. Allowing for 20% attrition, the sample size required for a definitive RCT was calculated as 170 participants. The intervention group showed improvements in self-management compared with the control group.  Conclusions  The feasibility outcomes achieved the prespecified criteria for proceeding to an RCT. The exploratory analyses suggest peer mentorship may improve OA self-management. An RCT of the OA peer mentorship intervention is therefore warranted with minor modifications to the intervention and trial procedures.  Trial registration number  ISRCTN:50675542.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore thoughts and ideas about the body and pain in patients with nonspecific low back pain (LBP) who have a high degree of fear of movement. METHODS: Patients with nonspecific LBP and a high degree of fear of movement, as measured using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, were asked to participate in the study. Individual semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 participants. The material was analyzed using content analysis with an inductive approach. RESULTS: From these patients' stories, an overarching theme-decreased confidence in the body becomes a barrier to living life to the fullest-emerged. This theme was further divided into 4 subthemes: (1) "What is wrong with my body?"-the constant search for an explanation; (2) searching for the right way to move; (3) loss of mobility means a lack of meaning in life; and (4) the message from health care professionals guides feelings, thoughts, and movement behavior. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the message of keeping physically active when experiencing LBP has succeeded, but patients with fear require support to feel secure and have enough confidence in their body to move and exercise. Clinicians need to better incorporate evidence-based practice for patients with fear and support them so that they can apply an understanding of pain to their bodies and their every day life. IMPACT: These results offer guidance for health care professionals to enhance their practice by providing more updated information to their patients who have recurrent LBP and fear. With better support, patients may be able to regain confidence in their bodies and live their lives to the fullest. LAY SUMMARY: If you have recurrent LBP and fear of moving your body, ask your health care professional to provide you with updated knowledge on pain and to help you regain confidence in your body so that you can live your life to the fullest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain often becomes a chronic condition and causes physical, psychological, social, and occupational impairment. Despite huge allocations of resources into the healthcare system and the labour market for treating and preventing low back pain, problems related to low back pain persist. A Danish randomised controlled trial identified an effective counselling intervention on low back pain patients' physical function, bodily pain and sick leave. Counselling addressed experienced workplace barriers and physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to achieve a deeper understanding of how the patients interpreted the explanatory resources that were made available to them during the intervention, and how they integrated these resources into their personal biographies. DESIGN: The present study was a qualitative analysis of a purposive sample of transcripts of status interviews performed during the randomised controlled trial's intervention. ANALYSIS: Between two individual counselling sessions, all 110 participants were interviewed about their perspectives on adhering to their individual plans for reaching specific goals for adjustments at their workplace and for enhancing physical activity. These plans were developed and agreed upon by the participants and the counsellor. A sample (n=20) of these interviews was analysed in the present study using the three steps in Ricoeur's method for text analysis. Bury's concept of chronic illness as a biographical disruption was used as a theoretical framework for further interpretations of the dataset. RESULTS: The participants valued the counsellor's open inquiry into the problems they had with their back. The participants' active engagement in creating new explanatory systems was crucial for their benefits from the intervention. If participants managed to change their health behaviour, it assisted them in transforming from being passive victims of pain into becoming active and in control. Participants who did not feel that they were sufficiently able to adhere to the treatment plan felt increasingly stigmatised, because they understood themselves to be in a position of disgrace in their own eyes and in the eyes of the system that offered them help. CONCLUSION: The counsellor's assistance in crafting the first possible and manageable steps towards returning to work and enhancing exercising supported the participants' commitment to the treatment plan.

AB  - Background--Low back pain (LBP) is a common burden affecting more than 80% of the adult population, with 85% classified as nonspecific. Nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP) is also common among children and adolescents. In the adult population, it is possible to distinguish patients with NSLBP from healthy controls by surface electromyography (sEMG) records. The aim of this systematic review was to identify existing published literature distinguishing children and adolescents with and without NSLBP using EMG parameters. Methods--Five electronic medical databases (PubMed, Embase, Central, Google Scholar, and Opengrey) and two manual sources (Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology, International Clinical Trials Registry) were searched by two independent reviewers. The qualitative reviews method referred to as PICO (Population, phenomenon of Interest, COntext) was used to identify initial keywords and to define inclusion and exclusion criteria of screened studies. Findings--One full-text study was included with a total of 28 patients with NSLBP and 28 age-matched healthy controls measured for back and abdominal EMG during sitting functional tasks. A global score of 17/19 was assessed for this study using a modified quality assessment checklist. Interpretation--Trunk EMG activation was shown to be the only parameter that could discriminate healthy from NSLBP adolescents in the sitting position when NSLBP patients were subclassified according to the O'Sullivan classification system. This systematic review highlights a lack of knowledge about muscle activity in the NSLBP pediatric population. The problem of NSLBP in children and adolescents is of great interest considering the epidemiological data and the future of adolescent development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite the frequent recommendation of activity pacing as a coping strategy for patients with chronic pain and/or fatigue, pacing is interpreted in different ways and there is an absence of a widely accepted pacing scale. We have developed a new Activity Pacing Questionnaire (APQ). The aims of this study were to explore patients' views and beliefs about the concept of pacing, together with the acceptability of the APQ. DESIGN: Qualitative pragmatic study using semi-structured telephone interviews. Data were analysed using Framework analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 16 adult patients attending secondary care physiotherapy out-patient departments were recruited via purposive sampling. Diagnoses included chronic low back pain, chronic widespread pain, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. FINDINGS: Pacing emerged as a multifaceted concept from participants' descriptions. The implementation of pacing was influenced by participants' age, the presence of co-morbidities and participants' emotions. The APQ was found to be generally acceptable in comparison to two existing pacing subscales. Participants undertook activities using quota/symptom-contingent approaches. Four behavioural typologies emerged: Task avoidance, Task persistence, Task fluctuation (boom-bust) and Task modification (activity pacing). CONCLUSIONS: The APQ appears to be easy to complete, and acceptable to patients who are attending physiotherapy for the management of long-term conditions. It emerged that individual patients implemented different pacing facets to varying degrees, and that different behavioural typologies were apparent. The relationships between behavioural typologies and facets of pacing warrant further investigation to facilitate the development of effective tailored pacing interventions.

AB  - Background. Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is currently considered a biopsychosocial syndrome, where individual, physical, occupational, psychological and social risk factors coexist. The available research indicates that physiotherapists (PTs) theoretically endorse the proposed biopsychosocial approach to treatment, yet very few are adopting this approach in clinical practice. Aim. The purpose of this exploratory survey is to obtain a detailed view of physiotherapists' perceptions in their local setting, with specific reference to the operators' kind of approach and professional skills in the treatment of CLBP. Methods. The survey tool was a focus group, based on a simulated clinical case conducted with expert operators selected on a voluntary basis. The results of the interview were analyzed using a qualitative-inductive method. Results. The analysis shows results related to three interconnected macro areas: the physiotherapists' professional skills/training, evaluation tools, and organizational structure. Physiotherapists' skills should be reinforced with training dedicated to communication-relational aspects and supported by assessment tools necessary to screen and evaluate psychosocial factors. As regards organizational structure, it takes the opportunity to design a clinical path or structure specialized in outpatient services for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Conclusion. Some results are aligned with the literature. In particular, the need to reinforce physiotherapists' inter-relational skills and to support them with the intervention of other specialists (multidisciplinary team) in the case of problems not strictly of their competence. The role of management is to identify organizational solutions to creating clinical pathways to reduce dispersion and to reinforce the professionals' expertise. Background. Il low back pain cronico (CLBP) è considerato una sindrome bio-psico-sociale, in cui coesistono fattori di rischio individuali, fisici, occupazionali, psicologici e sociali. L'evidenza corrente ci indica che i fisioterapisti condividono tale approccio da un punto di vista teorico, ma che non sempre lo adottano nella pratica clinica. Obiettivo. Scopo di questa indagine è di ottenere una visione dettagliata delle percezioni dei fisioterapisti nel contesto locale oggetto di studio, con particolare riferimento al tipo di approccio e al tipo di competenze degli operatori. Metodo. Lo strumento d'indagine è stato un focus group basato su un caso simulato e condotto con operatori esperti selezionati su base volontaria. I risultati dell'intervista sono stati analizzati con metodo qualitativo-induttivo. Risultati. Dall'analisi emergono contenuti relativi a 3 macroaree tra esse interconnesse: competenze/formazione dei professionisti, strumenti di valutazione e assetto organizzativo. Le competenze dei fisioterapisti dovrebbero essere rinforzate con formazione dedicata agli aspetti comunicativo- relazionali e supportate da strumenti di assessment necessari a screenare e valutare i fattori psico-sociali. Per quanto riguarda la dimensione organizzativa, emerge l'opportunità di definire un percorso e/o di strutturare servizi ambulatoriali specializzati per la presa in carico del paziente con CLBP. Conclusioni. Alcuni dei risultati sono allineati con la letteratura. In particolare: la necessità di rinforzare le competenze relazionali del fisioterapista e/o di supportarlo con l'intervento di altri specialisti (team) all'emergere di complessità non specifiche della disciplina. Ruolo del management è identificare soluzioni organizzative orientate alla costruzione di percorsi per ridurre la dispersione e rinforzare l'expertise dei professionisti.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The fear-avoidance model offers a promising framework for understanding the development of chronic postoperative pain and disability. However, limited research has examined this model in patients undergoing spinal surgery. PURPOSE: To determine whether preoperative and early postoperative fear of movement predicts pain, disability, and physical health at 6 months following spinal surgery for degenerative conditions, after controlling for depressive symptoms and other potential confounding variables. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A prospective cohort study conducted at an academic outpatient clinic. PATIENT SAMPLE: One hundred forty-one patients undergoing surgery for lumbar or cervical degenerative conditions. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported pain and disability were measured with the Brief Pain Inventory and the Oswestry Disability Index/Neck Disability Index, respectively. The physical composite scale of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) measured physical health. METHODS: Data collection occurred preoperatively and at 6 weeks and 6 months following surgery. Fear of movement was measured with the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia and depression with the Prime-MD PHQ-9. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty patients (85% follow-up) completed the 6-month postoperative assessment. Multivariable mixed-method linear regression analyses found that early postoperative fear of movement (6 weeks) predicted pain intensity, pain interference, disability, and physical health at 6-month follow-up (p<.05). Preoperative and early postoperative depression predicted pain interference, disability, and physical health. CONCLUSION: Results provide support for the fear-avoidance model in a postsurgical spine population. Early postoperative screening for fear of movement and depressive symptoms that do not acutely improve following surgical intervention appears warranted. Cognitive and behavioral strategies may be beneficial for postsurgical patients with high fear of movement and/or depressive symptoms.

AB  - Objective: To explore the impact of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on pain severity and endocrine, physical, and psychologic functioning in patients with chronic low-back pain (CLBP). Methods: A total of 28 participants were enrolled in the study between January and June 2014; 17 participants were sequentially sampled for an 8-week MBSR program, and 11 were placed on a waitlist control group. Pain severity, quality of life (QOL), global psychologic functioning, and depression were assessed at baseline, at the end of treatment, and 4-5 months post-treatment for both groups. Morning and evening salivary cortisol was assessed at multiple time points in participants in the MBSR group. Results: In comparison with baseline, evening cortisol release showed a significant increase post-treatment. Significant differences between groups were found in pain severity. Medium-to-large effect sizes were found for between-group differences in both pain severity and QOL. Conclusions: The cortisol increase in the MBSR group is a promising finding, in the context of CLBP hypocortisolism. Data show that the effects of the MBSR treatment may take time to surface. However, due to small sample size, decisive interpretation of findings is limited. Nevertheless, the MBSR program may show promise for CLBP and should be an avenue for further investigation through larger clinical trials within healthcare systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is general agreement that non-specific low back pain is best understood within a biopsychosocial understanding of health. However, clinicians and patients seemingly adhere to a biomedically derived diagnostic model, which may introduce misperceptions of pain and does not inform treatment or prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To explore, from the perspective of health-care practitioners, how persistent non- specific low back pain may be communicated in a way that moves beyond a biomedical diagnosis. DESIGN: An explorative qualitative investigation using a constructivist diagnostic framework. METHODS: Focus group and individual interviews of 10 purposefully selected chiropractors, physio-therapists and general practitioners were codified and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: "Clinicians' nuanced understanding of back pain"; "The challenges of shared decision-making"; "Cultural barriers to moving beyond biomedicine"; and "More than a label - individual explanations for pain". Pain and disability were perceived as products of multiple bio-psycho-social factors. Clinicians identified the impact of multiple social actors, an unhealthy work culture, and the organization of the medical system on the notion of pain and suffering. CONCLUSION: Clinicians perceived a need to communicate the complexity of non-specific low back pain in order to help patients make sense of their condition, rather than applying diagnostic labelling. There are multiple barriers to integrating a constructivistic diagnostic framework that need to be overcome.

AB  - Aims: This article looks at the effect that fear of movement can have on the lives of people with chronic low back pain. It describes the experiences of people who were attending a six week work hardening programme as part of their vocational rehabilitation in Sydney, Australia. Method: A thematic content analysis of data collected during an ethnographic study of eleven unemployed participants with chronic low back pain who attended the work hardening programme took place. The analysis focused on the effects of fear of movement on the participants' lives. Findings: The fear of movement impacted on all aspects of the participants' daily occupations and restricted their occupational roles. These changes involved loss of occupational roles, relationship changes, loss of participation in leisure and encountering barriers to returning to paid employment. Conclusions: The fi ndings suggest that fear of movement has a signifi cant effect on all areas of the lives of people with chronic low back pain. Recognizing fear of movement as a barrier will enable health professionals involved in vocational rehabilitation to develop a greater understanding of the context in which people with chronic low back pain live.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explored the phenomenological experiences of migrant care workers working in the formal long-term care setting in Japan and identified their stressors on caregiving. METHODS: We collected data using in-depth interviews among Filipino (n = 21), Indonesian (n = 6), and Vietnamese (n = 4) migrant care workers. We conducted the interviews in either their native language or in Japanese. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. We analyzed the transcripts using thematic analysis. We used qualitative data analysis software NVivo 10<sup> R</sup> to code and manage the data. RESULTS: Six key themes emerged that were related to stressors on caregiving. These include (1) coworker relationship, (2) language barrier, (3) work-life balance, (4) health concerns, (5) physical environment, and (6) patient relationship. Migrant care workers struggled with Kanji (Chinese characters) and verbal communication. Most of them shared having fatigue and chronic back pain. A few also mentioned about anxiety and depression. The low salary and heavy workload have made caregiving jobs unattractive to them. Workplace discrimination, patients' attitude, and a hostile work environment were part of their stressors at work. DISCUSSION: This study is the first step in highlighting the current issues being faced by migrant care workers in Japan. The stressors were the identified psychosocial issues of migrant care workers. The Japanese government is suggested to amend their care work policy and provide psychosocial support explicitly tailored for migrant care workers.

AB  - Background. Sagittal postural patterns are associated with back pain in adolescents and adults. However, whether postural patterns are already observable during childhood is unknown. Such a finding would confirm childhood as a key period for posture differentiation and thus for chronic pain etiology. Objective. The aims of this study were to identify and describe postural patterns in girls and boys of school age. Design. This was a cross-sectional study. Methods. Eligible children were evaluated at age 7 in the population-based birth cohort Generation XXI in Portugal. Posture was assessed through right-side photographs during habitual standing with retroreflective markers placed on body landmarks. Postural patterns were defined from trunk, lumbar, and sway angles with model-based clusters, and associations with anthropometric measures were assessed by multinomial logistic regression. Results. Posture was evaluated in 1,147 girls and 1,266 boys. Three postural patterns were identified: sway (26.9%), flat (20.9%), and neutral to hyperlordotic (52.1%) in girls and sway to neutral (58.8%), flat (36.3%), and hyperlordotic (4.9%) in boys. In girls, a higher body mass index was associated with a sway pattern (versus a flat pattern: odds ratio=1.21; 95% CI=1.12, 1.29), whereas in boys, a higher body mass index was associated with a hyperlordotic pattern (versus a flat pattern: odds ratio=1.30; 95% CI=1.17, 1.44). Limitations. Photogrammetry as a noninvasive method for posture assessment may have introduced some postural misclassifications. Conclusions. Postural patterns in 7-year-old children were consistent with those previously found in adults, suggesting that childhood is a sensitive period for posture differentiation. Sagittal morphology differed between girls and boys, emphasizing sex-specific biomechanical loads during a habitual upright position even in prepubertal ages.

AB  - • Physical activity is recommended in clinical guidelines for chronic low back pain. • Guidelines are silent in regards to which types of physical activity. • Leisure physical activity appears to be protective to low back pain. • Occupational physical activity appears to be harmful to low back pain. Low back pain is a highly prevalent and disabling musculoskeletal disorder. Physical activity is widely used as a prevention strategy for numerous musculoskeletal disorders; however, there is still conflicting evidence as to whether physical activity is a protective or risk factor for low back pain or whether activity levels differ between people with and without low back pain. To investigate the association between low back pain and different types (occupational and leisure) and intensities (moderate and vigorous) of physical activity. This is cross-sectional observational study. We included in this study a total of 1059 individuals recruited from a Spanish twin registry with data available on low back pain. Outcome: Self-reported leisure and occupational physical activity were the explanatory variables. The low back pain outcome used in this study was recurrent low back pain. Our results indicate that leisure physical activity is associated with a lower prevalence of recurrent low back pain. In contrast, occupational physical activity, such as carrying, lifting heavy weight while inclined, awkward postures (e.g. bending, twisting, squatting, and kneeling) are associated with a higher prevalence of recurrent low back pain. There was no statistically significant association between other occupational physical activities, such as sitting or standing, and low back pain. Leisure and occupational physical activity are likely to have an opposed impact on low back pain. While leisure physical activity appears to be protective, occupational physical activity appears to be harmful to low back pain. Future longitudinal studies should assist in formulating guidelines addressing specific types and intensity of physical activity aimed at effectively preventing low back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the impact of chronic, inflammatory arthritis on parenting and to develop a conceptual framework for subsequent study of mothering. METHODS: A qualitative, grounded theory design guided data collection and analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 12 women with either rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus who were mothers of at least 1 child living at home. Transcripts were analyzed using a systematic approach of coding and forming concepts and key categories to construct an explanatory framework. Peer checking and member checking enhanced analytical rigor. RESULTS: Analysis of participants' experiences resulted in 4 interrelated categories describing the impact of arthritis on their role as mothers: participation in mothering tasks, best described as "sometimes I can, sometimes I can't"; different types and levels of support from others; the influence of the mother's arthritis on the family; and the challenge of balancing energy and fatigue. Individuals' arthritis story, life stage, their children's developmental stage, and daily routine described the context in which mothers experienced elements of each of the 4 main categories. CONCLUSION: Inflammatory arthritis has a dramatic impact on the experience of motherhood, with both positive and negative influences. The perspectives shared by study participants may inform practice regarding problem identification and adaptive strategies, and the explanatory model generated from the data proposes hypotheses for further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic low back pain (LBP) has an important impact on quality of life, through pain and functional incapacity, but also psychosocial distress. The social participation consequences of LBP have been less explored. The objective was to better understand experiences of patients living with chronic LBP, with a focus on impact on relationships with family, friends and work colleagues. METHODS: Monocentric qualitative study in a tertiary-referral centre in Paris, France. Participants had chronic mechanical LBP. Semi-structured interviews were conducted during 4 focus groups discussions focusing on living with LBP. Verbatim was categorized and coded using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five persons (11 men, 14 women) participated; ages ranged 25-81 years. Participants often reported a negative self-perception in social interactions, with shame and frustration regarding their difficulties to perform activities of daily living. They often felt misunderstood and unsupported, partly due to the absence of visible signs of the condition. Participants suffered from the negative collective image attached to LBP ("benign/psychological disease"). LBP resulted in some patients in a significant loss of social identity with perceived impossibility to perform one's social role at home and at work. In contrast, family and friends were sometimes a support and helped in pain management. CONCLUSION: A systematic assessment of social role is needed in LBP care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The identification of helpful or unhelpful behavioral strategies for coping with pain would assist in optimizing the management of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). The objective was to develop and validate a questionnaire for categorizing behavioral strategies in patients with nonspecific CLBP. METHODS: (1) Development of a preliminary questionnaire based on a qualitative study in 25 patients with CLBP; (2) Item reduction and questionnaire validation by a multicenter international prospective study in patients with CLBP, with multiple correspondence analysis to identify behavioral profiles, whose characteristics and internal and external validities were assessed; 12-month study of treatments in 58 patients; (3) Evaluation of reproducibility in 30 patients. RESULTS: (1) The preliminary questionnaire had 87 items in eight pain-coping domains. (2) Three behavioral profiles were identified: effective coping, emotional distress, and kinesiophobia. The questionnaire was reduced to 21 items in seven domains. Cronbach's alpha indicated moderate internal consistency (0.47-0.66). External validity versus anxiety, depression, and coping strategies was good. As expected, functional restoration program was used more often by patients with kinesiophobia than by those with effective coping (50% vs. 25%, P<0.05). (3) Reproducibility was good (kappa=0.70). CONCLUSION: This new, simple questionnaire allows the identification of three behavioral profiles, thus guiding the development of personalized management programs for NCLBP.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is 1- to compare both the patient satisfaction and pain relief between patients who received pharmacological treatment and non-pharmacological treatment, also between patients who received physiotherapy and neural therapy in chronic low back pain, 2-to evaluate which demographic factors are associated with patient satisfaction mostly. Material and Methods: A total of 109 patients with chronic low back pain was enrolled to this study and divided into two groups: pharmacological treatment (n=49) as non-steroid antiinflammatory and myorelaxant drugs and non-pharmacological treatment (n=60) (25 patients who had only physiotherapy and 35 patients who had only neural therapy). Demographic characteristics and patient satisfaction variables (with 5 questions) was examined by a single blind physician with phone interview. Results: There was no relation between age, gender, having any chronic disease, working status, educational status and patient satisfaction in all patients. All patient satisfaction variables (p<0.001) were significantly better in patients who received non-pharmacological treatment than patients who received only pharmacological treatment. When patients who received only non-pharmacological treatment were evaluated; percentage of the pain relief (p<0.001) willingness to try this treatment again (p=0.001) and patient satisfaction score (p<0.001) were significantly higher in neural therapy group than physiotherapy group. Conclusion: Both physiotherapy and neural therapy have higher patient satisfaction than pharmacological treatment in chronic low back pain, furthermore the pain relief was significantly better in both physiotherapy and neural therapy methods. However the group with the most pain relief and patient satisfaction was found to be neural therapy group in our study. Considering the effect of neural therapy on pain, patient satisfaction, it seems to be a good alternative to physiotherapy. Bu çalışmanın amacı, 1- hem farmakolojik tedavi ve non-farmakolojik tedavi alan, ayrıca non-farmakolojik tedavi olarak fizik tedavi ve nöral terapi alan kronik bel ağrılı hastaların hasta memnuniyeti ve ağrı değişimi düzeylerini kıyaslamak, 2- hem de hangi demografik faktörlerin hasta memnuniyeti ile daha ilişkili olduğunu incelemektir. Gereç ve Yöntemler: Bu çalışmaya kronik bel ağrısı olan toplam 109 hasta kabul edilmiştir. Hastalar 2 gruba ayrılmıştır: farmakolojik tedavi grubunu steroid olmayan antiinflamatuar ve kas gevşetici ilaç tedavisi alan 49 hasta, farmakolojik olmayan tedavi grubunu da 60 hasta oluşturmuştur (fizik tedavi uygulanan 25 hasta ve nöral terapi uygulanan 35 hasta). Hastaların demografik verileri, hasta tatmin memnuniyeti (5 soru ile) hastaların hangi tedavi yöntemi aldığını bilmeyen bir klinisyen tarafından telefon görüşmesi ile kaydedilmiştir. Bulgular Yaş, cinsiyet, kronik hastalık varlığı, çalışma durumu, eğitim durumu ve hasta memnuniyeti arasında bir ilişki saptanmamıştır. Farmakolojik olmayan tedavi alan hastaların, tüm hasta memnuniyeti verileri farmakolojik tedavi alan hastalara göre istatistiksel olarak belirgin olarak daha iyi bulunmuştur (p<0,001). Farmakolojik olmayan tedavi alan hastalar incelendiğinde; ağrı azalma yüzdesi (p<0,001), bu tedaviyi yeniden deneme isteği (p<0,001) ve hasta memnuniyet skoru (p=0,001) nöral tedavi uygulanan hastalarda daha yüksek saptanmıştır. Sonuç Kronik bel ağrılı hastalarda hem fizik tedavi, hem de nöral tedavi yöntemi, farmakolojik tedaviye göre belirgin fazla bir hasta memnuniyeti sağlamaktadır, ayrıca ağrı azalması hem nöral terapi hem de fizik tedavi grubunda belirgin düzeyde fazla saptanmıştır. Bu çalışmada, en fazla hasta memnuniyeti ve ağrıda azalma sağlayan yöntem nöral terapi olarak bulunmuştur. Nöral terapinin ağrı ve hasta memnuniyeti üzerine etkisi göz önüne alındığında, fizik tedavi yöntemlerine iyi bir alternatif oluşturabilir.

AB  - Study Design: This is a case series in which case notes review and telephone interview update were used to assess the outcome following coccygectomy. Objective: To correlate the clinical results of coccygectomy with histology and discography of the sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal segments. Summary Of Background Data: Clinicians regard chronic disabling pain in the sacrococcygeal region with much dismay because of the reputed unpredictability of the treatment outcome. Methods: A total of 38 patients had coccygectomy for intractable coccydynia, and 31 were available for follow-up. The excised specimen with intact sacrococcygeal joint was sent for histologic examination in 22 patients. There were 6 patients investigated using sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal discography. Results: Mean postoperative follow-up was 6.75 years (range 2-16). There were 16 patients who benefited highly from the surgery, and 6 benefited to some extent, giving an overall beneficial result of 71%. Of all specimens, 86.3% had histologic changes of degeneration. Moderate-to-severe degenerate changes in sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal joints on histology were found in 54.5% of patients. Of these patients, 83.3% did well with surgery. Only 57.1% of those patients with mild changes did well. There were 2 patients who had positive discography, and both did well with surgery. Three patients had negative diskographies, and 2 of them had a poor result, and 1 had only some relief. Conclusions: It is possible that degenerate changes in sacrococcygeal discs and/or intercoccygeal discs are associated with pain. Surgical results are better in those with a severe degree of degenerative change. Coccygectomy remains a successful treatment for a majority of severely disabled patients with coccydynia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increasing need for physical therapists to address psychosocial aspects of musculoskeletal pain. Psychologically informed practice is one way to deliver this type of care through the integration of biopsychosocial interventions into patient management. An important component of psychologically informed practice is patient centered communication. However, there is little research on how to effectively implement patient centered communication into pre-licensure training for physical therapists. METHODS: Thirty Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students took part in an educational intervention that consisted of one 4-h didactic teaching session and three 1-h experiential learning sessions. Prior to the first session, students performed an examination of a standardized patient with chronic low back pain and were assessed on psychologically informed physical therapy (PIPT) adherent behaviors via a rating scale. Students also completed the Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (PABS-PT). After the last experiential session, students evaluated another standardized patient and were reassessed on PIPT adherent behaviors. Students retook the PABS-PT and qualitative data was also collected. RESULTS: After the educational intervention, students had positive changes in their pain attitudes and belief scores indicating a stronger orientation toward a psychosocial approach to patient care (p < 0.05). Additionally, after the intervention, students showed improvements in their adherence to using PIPT behaviors in their simulated patient interactions (p < 0.05). Qualitatively, students reported a high acceptability of the educational intervention with common themes indicating improved confidence with treating and communicating with complex patients. CONCLUSION: Students had attitudes and beliefs shift towards a more psychosocial orientation and demonstrated improved PIPT behaviors in simulated patient interactions after a brief educational intervention. Future research should investigate best practices for implementation of psychologically informed physical therapy for licensed clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Placebo medications, by definition, are composed of inactive ingredients that have no physiological effect on symptoms. Nonetheless, administration of placebo in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and in clinical settings has been demonstrated to have significant impact on many physical and psychological complaints. Until recently, conventional wisdom has suggested that patients must believe that placebo pills actually contain (or, at least, might possibly contain) active medication in order to elicit a response to placebo. However, several recent RCTs, including patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic low back pain, and episodic migraine, have demonstrated that individuals receiving open-label placebo (OLP) can still experience symptomatic improvement and benefit from honestly described placebo treatment. METHODS AND DESIGN: This paper describes an innovative multidisciplinary trial design (n = 280) that attempts to replicate and expand upon an earlier IBS OLP study. The current study will compare OLP to double-blind placebo (DBP) administration which is made possible by including a nested, double-blind RCT comparing DBP and peppermint oil. The study also examines possible genetic and psychological predictors of OLP and seeks to better understand participants' experiences with OLP and DBP through a series of extensive interviews with a randomly selected subgroup. DISCUSSION: OLP treatment is a novel strategy for ethically harnessing placebo effects. It has potential to re-frame theories of placebo and to influence how physicians can optimize watch-and-wait strategies for common, subjective symptoms. The current study aims to dramatically expand what we know about OLP by comparing, for the first time, OLP and DBP administration. Adopting a unique, multidisciplinary approach, the study also explores genetic, psychological and experiential dimensions of OLP. The paper ends with an extensive discussion of the "culture" of the trial as well as potential mechanisms of OLP and ethical implications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify criteria to be considered when developing an exoskeleton for low-back pain patients by exploring the perceptions and expectations of potential end users. BACKGROUND: Psychosocial, psychological, physical load, and personality influence incidence of low-back pain. Body-worn assistive devices that passively support the user's trunk, that is exoskeletons, can decrease mechanical loading and potentially reduce low-back pain. A user-centered approach improves patient safety and health outcomes, increases user satisfaction, and ensures usability. Still, previous studies have not taken psychological factors and the early involvement of end users into account. METHOD: We conducted focus group studies with low-back pain patients (n = 4) and health care professionals (n = 8). Focus group sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, using the general inductive approach. The focus group discussions included trying out an available exoskeleton. Questions were designed to elicit opinions about exoskeletons, desired design specifications, and usability. RESULTS: Important design characteristics were comfort, individual adjustability, independency in taking it on and off, and gradual adjustment of support. Patients raised concerns over loss of muscle strength. Health care professionals mentioned the risk of confirming disability of the user and increasing guarded movement in patients. CONCLUSION: The focus groups showed that implementation of a trunk exoskeleton to reduce low-back pain requires an adequate implementation strategy, including supervision and behavioral coaching. APPLICATION: For health care professionals, the optimal field of application, prevention or rehabilitation, is still under debate. Patients see potential in an exoskeleton to overcome their limitations and expect it to improve their quality of life.

AB  - Background and Aim: Recovery of patients with chronic low back pain (LBP) is depended on several physical and psychological factors. Therefore, the authors aimed to examine the efficacy of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) as a mind-body intervention on quality of life and pain severity of female patients with nonspecific chronic LBP (NSCLBP). Effectiveness of mindfulness meditation on pain and quality of life of patients with chronic low back pain Eighty-eight patients diagnosed as NSCLBP by physician and randomly assigned to experimental (MBSR+ usual medical care) and the control group (usual medical care only). The subjects assessed in 3 times frames; before, after and 4 weeks after intervention by Mac Gil pain and standard brief quality of life scales. Data obtained from the final sample analyzed by ANCOVA using SPSS software.  Results: The findings showed MBSR was effective in reduction of pain severity and the patients who practiced 8 sessions meditation reported significantly lower pain than patients who only received usual medical care. There was a significant effect of the between subject factor group (F [1, 45] = 16.45, P Conclusion: MBSR as a mind-body therapy including body scan, sitting and walking meditation was effective intervention on reduction of pain severity and improvement of physical and mental quality of life of female patients with NSCLBP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of communicative and educative strategies on 1) patient's low back pain awareness/knowledge, 2) maladaptive behavior modification and 3) compliance with exercise in patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Searches were performed on 13 databases. Only randomized controlled trials enrolling patients >= 18 years of age were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool and interrater agreement between authors for full-texts selection was evaluated with Cohen's Kappa. No meta-analysis was performed and qualitative analysis was conducted. RESULTS: 24 randomized controlled trials which intervention included communicative and educative strategies were selected. Most of the studies were judged as low risk of bias and Cohen's Kappa was excellent (=0.822). Interventions addressed were cognitive behavioral therapy as unique treatment or combined with other treatments (multimodal interventions), coaching, mindfulness, pain science education, self-management, graded activity and graded exposure. CONCLUSIONS, PRACTICE IMPLICATION: Patient's low back pain awareness/knowledge is still a grey area of literature. Pain science education, graded exposure and multimodal interventions are the most effective for behavior modification and compliance with exercise with benefits also in the long-term, while self-management, graded activity and coaching provide only short-term or no benefits.

AB  - The presence of a painful, disabling chronic disease may have implications for perceived ability to fulfill a parenting role. The purpose of this research was to examine the realities of parenting from the perspectives of mothers, fathers and grandparents with arthritis using a combination of methods: a cross sectional survey and in-depth focus group discussions. There was consensus that pain, fatigue and restricted physical functioning combined to interfere with the parenting role. Overall, approximately 35% of the sample had experienced difficulties attributed to arthritis. A gender difference emerged with women reporting more difficulties in relation to caring for babies and toddlers, whereas men reported more problems as children grew older. Key themes concerned: physical limitations; practical and caring issues; social factors; emotional response; hereditary risks and safety issues. Perceived inability to fulfill parenting roles resulted in feelings of frustration, guilt, anger and depression. A number of positive outcomes were mentioned including children's increased awareness of the needs of others. Limitations of the methodological approach adopted are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials in research settings have demonstrated the efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency neurotomy of the medial branches of the cervical dorsal rami in the palliation of chronic zygapophysial joint pain, a common cause of chronic neck pain, but one that is under-recognized in some quarters. AIMS: This study aimed to determine the outcomes of radiofrequency neurotomy in usual clinical practice for patients with established cervical zygapophysial joint pain. METHODS: The study was conducted in a public hospital, incorporating the private practice and public clinic elements of a single physician. All patients who underwent radiofrequency neurotomy had a diagnosis of cervical zygapophysial joint pain established by controlled cervical medial branch blocks. The primary outcome of duration of pain relief was determined for all consecutive procedures performed during a two-year period. Data were collected by chart review and telephone contact by an independent assessor. RESULTS: Forty-seven procedures were performed on 35 patients. Two patients were lost to follow-up. Twelve patients had two procedures. Thirty-six of 45 assessable procedures (80%) achieved significant pain relief. These 36 procedures achieved a mean duration of pain relief of 36 weeks, with a median of 35 weeks. Repeat procedures usually achieved reproducible pain relief. Most patients had significant postprocedural pain for about one week. Only one serious adverse event (local superficial infection) was reported. CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency neurotomy is an effective palliative treatment for chronic cervical zygapophysial joint pain when performed in routine clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic low back pain is an important public health problem, generating high financial and social costs. While most clinical guidelines stress the importance of managing low back pain in primary care, in practice a disproportionate amount of patients with low back pain present to emergency departments. Patients presenting to emergency departments may form a specific group with different factors leading to chronicity. This prospective cohort study aimed to determine the sociodemographic and psychological predictors of persistent low back pain and the length of sick leave due to pain in patients with acute symptoms visiting an emergency department. METHODS: Patients with a first episode of non-specific acute low back pain in at least three months were qualified for this study. The participants filled a battery of questionnaires, including measures of pain, pain-related disability, depression, anxiety and pain coping strategies. A structured telephone interview was performed after three months with questions regarding pain and the length of sick leave. RESULTS: 110 patients participated in the study. 97 patients completed the follow-up, with 70.1% suffering from pain after three months. Lower self-rated health predicted pain after three months. Longer length of sick leave was predicted by lower self-rated health, distraction as a coping strategy and decreased behavioral activity. CONCLUSION: Because of its simplicity, a measurement of self-rated health may be included in future clinical practice for assessing the risk of persistent pain.

AB  - Cognitive behavioral treatment has been incorporated into standard medical treatment procedures in German pain centers. Acceptance of the treatment by patients and outcome in terms of pain, coping, and disability was investigated. Components of the psychological treatment are education, relaxation and imagery, modifying thoughts and feelings, enhancement of pleasant activities, and training of good postural habits. The program was conducted in a group setting in accordance with a treatment manual and consists of 12 weekly 2.5-h sessions. A two-factor experiment with repeated measures on one factor was applied. Ninety-four consecutive patients with low-back pain were randomly assigned to an experimental group having a combined medical and cognitive-behavioral treatment, or to a control group with medical treatment only. Assessments were taken pre-treatment, post-treatment, and--in the treated group only--at a 6-months follow-up. At each assessment, patients kept a pain diary over a period of 4 weeks, and filled in self-report questionnaires. The sample consisted of 36 experimental and 40 control subjects at post-treatment. Experimental subjects reported less pain, better control over pain, more pleasurable activities and feelings, less avoidance and less catastrophizing. In addition, disability was reduced in terms of social roles, physical functions and mental performance. The results were maintained at follow-up. Patients who only received medical treatment showed little improvement. Data indicate that the program meets the needs of the patients and should be continued.

AB  - Background: Peripheral embolism to the lower extremities may mimic disc prolapse with severe consequences.Case Report: A 71-year-old male with a history of chronic alcoholism developed low back pain radiating to both lower extremities in a nonradicular distribution and bilateral dysesthesias of the distal lower legs after lifting a heavy weight. Given that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine showed disc herniation in L3/4 and L4/5, he was scheduled for laminectomy but was unable to undergo surgery due to thrombocytopenia. After transfer to another hospital, persistence of symptoms and signs, absent pulses on the distal lower legs, and rhabdomyolysis with temporary renal insufficiency, peripheral embolism with compartment syndrome was suspected. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery and long high-grade stenosis of the left superficial and profound femoral arteries and distal arteries. He successfully underwent embolectomy and fasciotomy.Conclusions: If lumbar pain is not radicular, peripheral pulses are minimally palpable, and distal limbs are cold and show livid decolorization, peripheral embolism is much more likely than disc herniation, particularly if the patient's history is positive for atrial fibrillation. MRI of the lumbar spine must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical presentation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back disorders (CLBDs) are a substantial burden on individuals and societies, and impact up to 20% of Canadians. Rural and remote residents are approximately 30% more likely to have CLBDs. Reduced access to appropriate team-based health services, including physical therapy, is a key factor that may magnify the impact of CLBD on pain, physical function, overall quality of life, health-related system costs, and individual costs. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to evaluate the validity, comparative effectiveness, costs, barriers, and facilitators of an interprofessional management approach for people with CLBDs, delivered via telehealth. METHODS: This project will examine 3 different health care delivery options: (1) in-person nurse practitioner (NP); (2) in-person physical therapist (PT); and (3) a team approach utilizing an NP (in-person) and a PT joining via telehealth. Validity of the telehealth team care model will be explored by comparing the diagnostic categorization and management recommendations arising from participants with CLBD who undergo a team telehealth, in-person NP, and in-person PT assessment. Comparative effectiveness and costs will be examined using a community-based randomized controlled trial in a rural Saskatchewan community with limited PT services. The 3 arms of the trial are: (1) usual care delivered by a local rural NP; (2) a local NP and an urban-based PT joining via telehealth; and (3) face-to-face services by a PT traveling to the community. Patient-reported outcomes of pain, physical function, quality of life, satisfaction, and CLBD care-related costs will be evaluated up to 6 months after the intervention. Patient and provider experiences with the team telehealth approach will be explored through qualitative interviews. RESULTS: The study was funded in July 2013 and the University of Saskatchewan Biomedical Research Ethics Board approved the study in November 2013. Participant recruitment began in September 2014 and data collection was completed in December 2015. Analysis is in progress and results are anticipated in 2017. CONCLUSIONS: CLBD is a widespread public health problem, particularly in rural and remote areas, which requires new innovative approaches to deliver appropriate health care. The results of this project will inform the development of evidence-informed approaches and community-based implementation strategies to improve access to PT services in primary health care settings in other rural and remote underserved areas. Findings might also provide a framework for cost-effective and patient-centered models of service delivery for the management of other chronic conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To outline professionals' experiences of participation, perceived benefits and acceptability of the interventions delivered in the ATEAM trial (Alexander technique lessons, exercise, and massage), for patients with chronic or recurrent back pain. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews was conducted with a purposeful sample of twenty professionals (general practitioners (GPs), nurses, Alexander technique teachers, and massage therapists). Data were recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically using the constant comparison method. RESULTS: Evidence of effectiveness GPs wanted an evidence base for the interventions, whilst nurses, Alexander technique teachers and massage therapists perceived patient reports of benefit as evidence. Professionals' perception of the acceptability of the intervention: professional perspectives differed, with GPs and nurses viewing the structured nature of exercise prescription and Alexander technique lessons as more beneficial and acceptable than massage in alleviating patients' back pain. Economic cost: the cost to patients pursuing Alexander technique lessons and massage was perceived to be a barrier outside the trial. Inter-professional communication: there was little communication between the professionals groups within the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Valuable insights have been gained into the perceived benefits and acceptability of exercise, Alexander technique lessons and massage as interventions for chronic back pain. Lessons in the Alexander technique with or without exercise, was perceived as more beneficial and acceptable than massage by professionals who participated and delivered the ATEAM trial interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The homeopathic drug combination Lymphdiaral Basistropfen is established in the treatment of edema and swellings. This is the first time the effectiveness and safety was investigated in the treatment of chronic low back pain. METHODS: The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. From December 2003 to May 2007 248 patients aged 18 to 75 years were screened, 228 were randomized, 221 started therapy, in 192 the progress was measured (103 verum vs. 89 placebo), 137 completed the study (72 verum vs. 65 placebo). They received 10 drops of verum or placebo solution three times daily for 105 days additionally to an inpatient complex naturopathic treatment. RESULTS: The hannover functional ability questionnaire score (primary outcome measure) tends to increase in the intention-to-treat-analysis (verum: 6.6 vs. placebo: 3.4; p = 0.11) and increases significantly in the per-protocol-analysis (verum: 9.4 vs. placebo: 4.1; p = 0.029). The treatment was well tolerated (92.9% vs. 95.4%). The incidence of adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions was similar in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: This first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial shows, that the homeopathic drug combination can improve the treatment of chronic low back pain.

AB  - Study Design: A prospective follow-up study of patients undergoing anterior spinal decompression and bone graft with cortical iliac crest bone.Objective: To describe a modified technique for harvesting cortical bone graft from the anterior iliac crest.Summary Of Background Data: Cortical bone graft from the iliac crest frequently is used in various orthopedic and spinal procedures. The resulting defect in the iliac crest has been associated with many complications.Methods: Twenty patients were included in this study. All had burst vertebral fracture requiring anterior spinal decompression and cortical bone grafting. The modified technique was used for harvesting the iliac crest bone graft in all patients.Results: All patients were satisfied with the appearance of the iliac crest. None reported chronic pain at the graft site. None had fracture of the iliac wing, and none had symptoms related to the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve or herniation of pelvic contents through the bony defect in the iliac wing.Conclusion: This modified technique is technically straightforward and cost-effective. It preserves the contour and shape of the iliac crest and avoids cosmetic deformities and chronic pain at the graft site. It creates a window in the iliac wing rather than disrupting the continuity of the iliac crest, which leaves the iliac wing structurally stronger than with currently used techniques.

AB  - This pilot study examined the feasibility and potential efficacy of a self-management program for seniors with chronic back pain and assessed for possible race/ ethnicity differences in program impact. Sixty-nine seniors (24 African Americans, 25 Hispanics, and 20 non-Hispanic Whites) enrolled in the 8-wk community-based program. Efficacy outcomes included pain-related disability as measured by the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, social activity, and functional status. Eighty percent of enrollees completed the program. Clinically important decreases in RMDQ scores were found for non-Hispanic White (adjusted change score = -3.53), African American (-3.89), and Hispanic (-8.45) participants. Improvements in all other outcomes were observed, but only for Hispanic participants. Results confirm that implementation of the protocol in urban senior centers is feasible, and the program shows potential efficacy. The race/ethnicity differences observed in the current study merit further investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore and describe how patients with recurrent low back pain perceive and respond to the recurrence of pain. DESIGN: A semi-structured interview study. SUBJECTS: Seventeen patients (10 women and 7 men) with recurrent low back pain. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were analysed using the phenomenographic method. RESULTS: Patients' perceptions of relapse of low back pain could be divided into 4 different categories: (i) an unsolved mystery, a source of uncertainty and self-accusation; (ii) an obvious part of life that has to be ignored; (iii) a reminder to keep within limits, both physically and psychologically; and (iv) an indication to change behaviour to prevent further relapse. The categories could be grouped hierarchically such that they reflect to what extent the patients showed readiness and self-efficacy in adopting self-management strategies to prevent further relapses. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that patients with relapse in low back pain could respond in different ways to the recurrence of pain and show different degree of readiness to change behavioural and movement patterns in order to prevent further relapses. The different responses might be important aspects to which physicians and allied health professionals should pay attention in the rehabilitation process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the prevalence and characteristics of breakthrough pain (BTP) in patients with chronic back pain. DESIGN: Researchers utilized a telephone survey using a pain assessment algorithm. This report represents a subset of patients from a larger survey of 228 patients with chronic pain unrelated to cancer. PARTICIPANTS: This study employed 117 subjects taking opioids for a primary diagnosis of back pain and receiving care at geographically dispersed pain treatment centers. Subjects had pain lasting at least six months and had "controlled" baseline pain. RESULTS: Eighty-seven subjects (74 percent) experienced 93 types of BTP. The median number of BTP episodes per day was two; median time to maximum intensity was 10 minutes, and median duration was 55 minutes. Onset could not be predicted for 46 percent of pains. Eighty-three percent of subjects used shorter-acting opioids for BTP. Other medications used for pain included NSAIDs, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, skeletal muscle relaxants, intrathecal local anesthetics, and transdermal local anesthetics. CONCLUSIONS: These patients with opioid-treated chronic back pain commonly experienced BTP, which often had a rapid onset and a relatively short duration and was difficult to predict. Opioids were the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy, but nonopioid analgesics and adjuvant analgesics were commonly used.

AB  - Postoperative low-back pain and spasm are the main drawbacks of chymopapain chemonucleolysis. To investigate if low-dose chymopapain could reduce this adverse reaction, without modifying the efficacy, 118 patients with persistent low-back and radicular pain due to a lumbar disc herniation underwent chemonucleolysis. 60 patients were randomly selected to receive 2 mL of standard-dose chymopapain (4,000 units) and 58 to receive 2 mL of low dose (2,000 units). The clinical outcome was assessed on study days 1, 30, and 60, and after 1 year by physicians who were unaware of the treatment, and on the basis of the patients' self evaluation. At day 60, Chemonucleolysis was rated as successful in 81% of the cases by the investigator and in 80% by the patient's self assessment. The percentage of good results was remarkably similar in the two treatment groups and this finding was confirmed after 1 year. There was some evidence that the low-dose treatment resulted in less frequent postoperative back pain but the difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, a comparable incidence of acute low-back pain and spasm was observed in the two treatment groups. Low-dose chemonucleolysis appears to be as effective as the standard dose, but the use of 2,000 units does not significantly lower the postoperative back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore beliefs and apprehensions about disease and its treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis. METHODS: 25 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 25 with spondyloarthritis participated in semi-structured interviews about their disease and its treatment. The interviews were performed by trained interviewers in participants' homes. The interviews were recorded and the main themes identified by content analysis. RESULTS: Patients differentiated between the underlying cause of the disease, which was most frequently identified as a hereditary or individual predisposition. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the most frequently cited triggering factor for disease onset was a psychological factor or life-event, whereas patients with spondyloarthritis tended to focus more on an intrinsic vulnerability to disease. Stress and overexertion were considered important triggering factors for exacerbations, and relaxation techniques were frequently cited strategies to manage exacerbations. The unpredictability of the disease course was a common source of anxiety. Beliefs about the disease and apprehensions about the future tended to evolve over the course of the disease, as did treatment expectations. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis hold a core set of beliefs and apprehensions that reflect their level of information about their disease and are not necessarily appropriate. The physician can initiate discussion of these beliefs in order to dispel misconceptions, align treatment expectations, provide reassurance to the patient and readjust disease management. Such a dialogue would help improve standards of care in these chronic and incapacitating diseases.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential interaction between treatment content and subgroups according to the Swedish version of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI-S) on the effect on sickness absence during a 10-year follow-up in a population with chronic neck pain (NP) and/or low back pain (LBP). Methods: This study is based on a randomized controlled multicentre trial with a 10-year follow-up using the MPI-S and included 214 participants. The interventions consisted of Behavioural-oriented Physiotherapy (PT), Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Behavioural Medicine Rehabilitation (BM), and a 'treatment-as-usual' control group (CG). Results: There appears to be a difference in the development of sickness absence after rehabilitation for the adaptive coper (AC) group even though the result did not reach statistical significance. AC seems to respond most favourably to the multidisciplinary programme compared to the CG. The development of sickness absence after intervention among interpersonally distressed (ID) and dysfunctional (DYS) patients were similar across all three treatment alternatives as well as CG. Conclusion: In terms of long-term follow-up of sickness absence, the multidisciplinary programme appears to be most beneficial for DYS and AC patients. In contrast, the CBT and PT interventions failed to benefit any patient group.

AB  - This study analyzes the combination of different and differing representations and care practices that social groups belonging to a mid-impoverished sector of Madrid use to alleviate chronic muscular pain, as well as the consequences that this has for both domestic and work life. I collected empirical evidence in a peripheral neighborhood of Madrid during 2004 using a number of anthropological methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and life-history interviews. The following results can be singled out from the completed investigation: in the context of social impoverishment there are macrostructural factors that are transformed into health-destructive processes that influence the development and incidence of chronic muscular illness. This requires the different social groups that are suffering from this to establish a number of care practices mainly based on the use of Western medicine as well as other medical traditions of self-care. These practices relate to economic, educational, sociocultural, and ideological factors that characterize the lives of these individuals. This essay focuses on perceptions of illness and care practices beyond the biomedical context, as it addresses those representations and practices that these impoverished social groups display in accordance with their way of life and in relation to their ailments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of this qualitative study was to explore the lived experience of spinal cord injury (SCI) as described by life story interviews with two adults who sustained SCI as children. CASE PRESENTATION: Data were collected by conducting 15 life story interviews with two individuals with SCI. Atkinson's Life Story Interview approach along with open-ended questions was utilized to capture the narrative data. Polkinghorne's narrative analysis of eventful data approach was used to configure the data elements into a story with the purpose of understanding the lived experience of SCI of these two individuals. Four themes relevant to the experience of living with a chronic condition emerged: adjustment to life with SCI, hardiness, interdependence, and post-traumatic growth. DISCUSSION: This study illustrated how the two participants' personal development and life trajectories were deeply shaped by pediatric-onset SCI. The life story interview process proved to be an effective approach to understanding the lived experience of SCI as told by two adults with pediatric-onset SCI. While the two participants represented unique contexts, their stories conveyed several cohesive, transcendent themes relevant to the experience of living with a chronic condition. Future narrative inquiry research in individuals with pediatric-onset SCI is necessary to build a representation of this population's lived experiences.

AB  - Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is a leading cause of chronic low back pain that affects millions of people every year. Yet identification of the specific IVD causing this pain is based on qualitative visual interpretation rather than objective findings. One possible approach to diagnosing pain-associated IVD could be to identify acidic IVDs, as decreased pH within an IVD has been postulated to mediate discogenic pain. We hypothesized that quantitative chemical exchange saturation transfer (qCEST) MRI could detect pH changes in IVDs, and thence be used to diagnose pathologically painful IVDs objectively and noninvasively. To test this hypothesis, a surgical model of IVD degeneration in Yucatan minipigs was used. Direct measurement of pH inside the degenerated IVDs revealed a significant drop in pH after degeneration, which correlated with a significant increase in the qCEST signal. Gene analysis of harvested degenerated IVDs revealed significant upregulation of pain-, nerve- and inflammatory-related markers after IVD degeneration. A strong positive correlation was observed between the expression of pain markers and the increase in the qCEST signal. Collectively, these findings suggest that this approach might be used to identify which IVD is causing low back pain, thereby providing valuable guidance for pain and surgical management.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the relation between occupational and nonoccupational conditions and both incident (IBLP) and chronic low back pain (CLBP), as well as depression, among women and men. Data from a 4-year follow-up of a study group consisting of 420 participants of both genders from the general Swedish population were analysed. Occupational risk indicators were predictors for both ILBP and CLBP. Depression was not found to be a predictor for either IBLP or CLBP among women, but was a predictor for CLBP among men. Among women, depression had some risk indicators in common with ILBP and appeared to be a concurrent outcome rather than a risk indicator. Low back pain in 1993 was not a predictor for depression in 1997 in either women or men. Occupational conditions are of relevance in relation to both incident and CLBP. Nonoccupational conditions were stronger predictors for CLBP than for ILBP but had some predictive value also for ILBP.

AB  - The investigator in this phenomenological study examined the lived experience of Quality of Life (QOL) in 15 Registered Nurses (RNs) with chronic back pain (CBP) participating in structured journal writing. Hermeneutic analysis of interviews and journals revealed eight themes under two domains: Making Normal (Fighting and Denying; Being Consumed: Anger and Frustration; Surviving the Three Ds: depression, devastation, and despair; and Choosing, Adapting, and Accepting) and Living with the Shadow (Losses and Limitations, Being Less than Whole, Having Intimate Knowledge, and Living Through Fatigue). The essence of the experience is Dancing with the Shadow: Re-Visioning Quality of Life. The Shadow is the constant presence of CBP in the participants' lives. The essence involves a delicate dance of control; nurses' QOL improved when they had control over the CBP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) unit modified to deliver electrical impulses at random (R) or stochastic frequency, called TENS-R, provided better pain relief than conventional TENS. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study at an urban teaching hospital. A total of 13 adult subjects with radiculopathy on electromyogram and chronic radicular pain rated pain before and after walking 100 feet with proximal (axial) placement of TENS leads with randomized settings on conventional TENS, placebo, or TENS-R and, subsequently, with distal (limb) placement of TENS leads with randomized settings, all on the same day. The pain measures used were the McGill Pain Questionnaire, parts 1 and 2, and the Visual Analog Scale. The functional measure was speed of walking. RESULTS: Four men and seven women completed the study pain scores, measured by McGill Pain Questionnaire part 2, significantly improved when the patient used TENS-R vs. conventional TENS (P = 0.006, analysis of variance). Placement of TENS electrodes on the back significantly decreased pain compared with lead placement on the legs for McGill Pain Questionnaire part 1 (P = 0.007), McGill Pain Questionnaire part 2 (P = 0.042), and the Visual Analog Scale (P = 0.026) measures. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative pain scores significantly improved when the patient used TENS-R vs. conventional TENS. Lead placement of any TENS modality over the back vs. over the leg improved all pain scores.

AB  - Purpose: To compare MRI-defined back muscle volume between AS patients and age, and spinopelvic alignment matched control patients with chronic back pain.Methods: 51 male patients with AS were enrolled. Age and spinopelvic alignment matched controls (male) were found among non-AS patients with chronic back pain. After matching procedure, fully matched controls were found in 31 of 51 AS patients (60.8%), who represent AS patients without deformity. However, matched controls were not found in 20 of 51 AS patients (39.2%), who represent AS patients with deformity. MRI parameters of back muscle (paraspinal muscle and psoas muscle) at L4/5 disc level including cross-sectional area (CSA) and fat-free cross-sectional area (FCSA) were compared between AS patients and matched controls. Covariates, including BMI, self-reported physical activity, and the presence of chronic disease, which can influence back muscle volume, were also investigated.Results: There were no statistical differences in age, body mass index, score of back pain (NRS), and spinopelvic alignment, and physical activity between matched AS patients and control patients except for duration of back pain. All MRI parameters for paraspinal muscle volume in matched AS patients (without deformity) were significantly less than those of control patients, and significantly larger than those of non-matched AS patients (with deformity). Body size adjusted MRI parameters (relative CSA and relative FCSA) of paraspinal muscle showed strong correlations with lumbar lordosis and sacral slope. Such relationship between paraspinal muscle and spinopelvic parameters remained significant even after multivariate adjustment.Conclusions: AS patients without deformity already have decreased paraspinal muscle volume compared with age and spinopelvic alignment matched non-AS patients with chronic back pain. Such decrease in paraspinal muscle volume was significantly associated with kyphotic deformity of AS patients even after multivariate adjustment. Although the result of our study supports the causal relationship between muscle degeneration and kyphotic deformity in AS patients, further study is required to prove the causality.

AB  - Low back pain continues to affect a significant proportion of the younger, working population between 35 and 45 years of age. An important study has correlated macroscopic and microscopic intervertebral disc alterations starting in the second decade of life with oxidative stress manifested by the presence of N-(carboxylmethyl)lysine. Job satisfaction remains a strong predictive factor for the identification of individuals with acute back pain who will develop chronic pain. Patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis may have an increase in their erythrocyte sedimentation rate during the first 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy without requiring surgical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging enhancement of migrated disc fragments identifies individuals who are likely to resolve sciatica without surgical intervention. As many as 25% of individuals with low back pain are symptomatic at 12 months, in contradistinction to the dictum of resolution of pain in 2 months. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants are a very effective combination for the effective treatment of acute low back pain. A majority of chiropractic manipulations are performed for inappropriate indications.

AB  - Chronic pain is experienced by 30% of individuals who suffer from pain in industrial countries. Chronic low back pain is of particular interest to the occupational health nurse. The incidence and financial cost can be documented, but the effects on an individual's life and family are not as easily recognized. This qualitative study using phenomenology describes the meaning of chronic low back pain to individuals. This study indicates that chronic low back pain dominated the lives of the individuals. The primary areas of focus were altered lifestyle and overall quality of life.

AB  - Using a phenomenologic approach, the meaning of chronic low back pain to 15 individuals was examined. Interviews were conducted and analyzed and six distinct areas were identified. The focus of this presentation is limited to altered interactions and varied psychological reactions, including a negative response toward others, a desire to maintain independence, and a belief that the pain being experienced is real. The individuals experienced social isolation, enhanced awareness of others experiencing pain, and varied psychological reactions. The presence of pain affects individuals physically, but the meaning to the individual and the impact on his or her life is more far-reaching.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the perceptions of orthopaedic clinicians about consultations for people with persistent musculoskeletal low back pain (PMLBP) in which surgery is not recommended. Surgery is not recommended for the majority of PMLBP consulting in secondary care settings. SETTING: Secondary care sector in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 24 orthopaedic team clinicians from 17 different hospitals in the UK and Ireland. Interviews explored clinicians' perceptions of the challenges in consultations where surgery is not indicated. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two meta-themes, Difficulties and Enablers, each consisting of several subthemes were identified. Difficulties included challenges around the choice of appropriate terminology and labels for PMLBP, managing patients' expectations, working with mentally vulnerable patients and explaining imaging findings. Enablers included early management of expectations, use of routine imaging, triaging, access to direct referral elsewhere, including other non-surgical practitioners in the team, training to improve communication skills and understanding of psychological issues. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight clinicians' perceived need for concordance in messages delivered across the care pathway and training of orthopaedic clinicians to deliver effective reassurance and address patients' needs in circumstances where surgery is not indicated.

AB  - Health literacy, the ability to seek, understand and utilise health information, is important for good health. Suboptimal health literacy has been associated with poorer health outcomes in many chronic conditions although this has not been studied in chronic low back pain (CLBP). We examined the health literacy of individuals with CLBP using a mixed methods approach. One-hundred and seventeen adults, comprising 61 with no history of CLBP and 56 with CLBP (28 with low and high disability, respectively, as determined by a median split in Oswestry scores) participated. Data regarding severity of pain, LBP-related disability, fear avoidance, beliefs about LBP and pain catastrophizing were collected using questionnaires. Health literacy was measured using the Short-form Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA). A sub-sample of 36 participants with CLBP also participated in in-depth interviews to qualitatively explore their beliefs about LBP and experiences in seeking, understanding and using information related to LBP. LBP-related beliefs and behaviours, rather than pain intensity and health literacy skills, were found to be important correlates of disability related to LBP. Individuals with CLBP-high disability had poorer back pain beliefs and increased fear avoidance behaviours relating to physical activity. Health literacy (S-TOFHLA) was not related to LBP beliefs and attitudes. Qualitatively, individuals with CLBP-high disability adopted a more passive coping style and had a pathoanatomic view of their disorder compared to individuals with CLBP-low disability. While all participants with CLBP had adequate health literacy scores (S-TOFHLA), qualitative data highlighted difficulties in seeking, understanding and utilising LBP information.

AB  - Study Design: Concealed allocation, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial.Objective: To assess the efficacy of an educational video in the tertiary prevention of persistent WAD symptoms following rear-end motor vehicle collisions (MVCs).Summary Of Background Data: Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) are an important and costly health problem. There is a lack of high quality evidence surrounding efficacy of treatments for WAD. Existing research supports active interventions and early return to regular activities.Methods: Consecutive patients presenting to four tertiary care emergency departments following rear-end MVCs were eligible. Following informed consent, patients were allocated, using central randomization, to receive an educational video plus usual care or usual care alone. The video provided reassurance, and advice about posture, return to regular activities, exercises, and pain-relief methods. Data were collected by telephone using standardized questionnaires. The primary outcome was presence of Persistent WAD Symptoms at 24 weeks postinjury, based on the frequency and severity of neck, shoulder, or upper back pain. The absolute difference in proportion of patients with persistent WAD symptoms and rate ratios were calculated. Changes in pain scores were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.Results: The intervention (n = 206) and control (n = 199) groups were similar at baseline (mean age 38.4 years; 64% female). Overall, the proportion of subjects with Persistent WAD Symptoms decreased from 89.1% at baseline to 33.6% at 24 weeks after injury. At 24 weeks, the proportion of subjects with persistent WAD symptoms in the intervention group was 7.9% (95% CI, -2.0, 17.8) lower than the control group. The median improvement in pain score at 24 weeks was 3 for the intervention group and 2 for the control group (P = 0.016).Conclusion: The presence of persistent WAD symptoms following simple rear-end MVCs was high in this sample. The video group demonstrated a trend toward less severe WAD symptoms. We recommend evaluating other educational interventions that could reduce WAD symptoms.

AB  - A randomized clinical trial of 30 patients with refractory lumbar disc disease with evidence of a herniation at a single intervertebral space on the myelogram is presented. Collagenase or a saline placebo was injected into the affected disc. Lack of pain reduction or lack of functional improvement was considered a therapeutic failure. Patients who failed to respond to the placebo could subsequently receive a collagenase injection. Thirty-three percent (33%) of the 15 patients who received a placebo and 80% of the 15 patients who received collagenase were rated successful 8 weeks after injection. The study demonstrates a statistically significant effectiveness of collagenase in the treatment of herniated lumbar disc disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Several conservative therapies have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP), including different forms of exercise and spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). The efficacy of less time-consuming and less costly self-care interventions, for example, home exercise, remains inconclusive in CLBP populations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the relative efficacy of supervised exercise, spinal manipulation, and home exercise for the treatment of CLBP. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: An observer-blinded and mixed-method randomized clinical trial conducted in a university research clinic in Bloomington, MN, USA. PATIENT SAMPLE: Individuals, 18 to 65 years of age, who had a primary complaint of mechanical LBP of at least 6-week duration with or without radiating pain to the lower extremity were included in this trial. OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-rated outcomes were pain, disability, general health status, medication use, global improvement, and satisfaction. Trunk muscle endurance and strength were assessed by blinded examiners, and qualitative interviews were performed at the end of the 12-week treatment phase. METHODS: This prospective randomized clinical trial examined the short- (12 weeks) and long-term (52 weeks) relative efficacy of high-dose, supervised low-tech trunk exercise, chiropractic SMT, and a short course of home exercise and self-care advice for the treatment of LBP of at least 6-week duration. The study was approved by local institutional review boards. RESULTS: A total of 301 individuals were included in this trial. For all three treatment groups, outcomes improved during the 12 weeks of treatment. Those who received supervised trunk exercise were most satisfied with care and experienced the greatest gains in trunk muscle endurance and strength, but they did not significantly differ from those receiving chiropractic spinal manipulation or home exercise in terms of pain and other patient-rated individual outcomes, in both the short- and long-term. CONCLUSIONS: For CLBP, supervised exercise was significantly better than chiropractic spinal manipulation and home exercise in terms of satisfaction with treatment and trunk muscle endurance and strength. Although the short- and long-term differences between groups in patient-rated pain, disability, improvement, general health status, and medication use consistently favored the supervised exercise group, the differences were relatively small and not statistically significant for these individual outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated that the significant others of individuals with persistent back pain may have important influences on work participation outcomes. The aim of this study was to extend previous research by including individuals who have remained in work despite persistent back pain in addition to those who had become incapacitated for work, along with their significant others. The purpose of this research was to explore whether the illness beliefs of significant others differed depending on their relative's working status, and to make some preliminary identification of how significant others may facilitate or hinder work participation for those with persistent back pain. METHODS: Interviews structured around the Illness Perception Questionnaire (chronic pain version) were conducted with back pain patients recruited from a hospital pain management clinic along with their significant others. Some patients had remained in work despite their back pain; others had ceased employment. Data were analysed using template analysis. RESULTS: There were clear differences between beliefs about, and reported responses to, back pain symptoms amongst the significant others of individuals who had remained in employment compared with the significant others of those who had ceased work. Three overarching themes emerged: perceived consequences of back pain, specific nature of employment and the impact of back pain on patient identity. CONCLUSIONS: Significant others of employed individuals with back pain focused on the extent to which activity could still be undertaken despite back pain symptoms. Individuals out of work due to persistent back pain apparently self-limited their activity and were supported in their beliefs and behaviours by their significant others. To justify incapacity due to back pain, this group had seemingly become entrenched in a position whereby it was crucial that the individual with back pain was perceived as completely disabled. We suggest that significant others are clearly important, and potentially detrimental, sources of support to individuals with back pain. The inclusion of significant others in vocational rehabilitation programmes could potentially be a valuable way of mobilising readily accessible resources in a way that supports optimal functioning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a costly healthcare problem and the leading cause of disability among adults in the United States. Primary care providers urgently need effective ways to deliver evidence-based, nonpharmacological therapies for chronic low back pain. Guidelines published by several government and national organizations have recommended nonpharmacological and nonopioid pharmacological therapies for low back pain. OBJECTIVE: The Pain eHealth Platform (PEP) pilot trial aims to test the feasibility of a highly innovative intervention that (1) uses an electronic health record (EHR) query to systematically identify a phenotype of obese, older adults with chronic low back pain who may benefit from Web-based behavioral treatments; (2) delivers highly tailored messages to eligible older adults with chronic low back pain via the patient portal; (3) links affected patients to a Web app that provides education on the efficacy of evidence-based, nonpharmacological, behavioral pain treatments; and (4) directs patients to existing Web-based health treatment tools. METHODS: Using a three-step modified Delphi method, an expert panel of primary care providers will define a low back pain phenotype for an EHR query. Using the defined low back pain phenotype, an EHR query will be created to identify patients who may benefit from the PEP. Up to 15 patients with low back pain will be interviewed to refine the tailored messaging, esthetics, and content of the patient-facing Web app within the PEP. Up to 10 primary care providers will be interviewed to better understand the facilitators and barriers to implementing the PEP, given their clinic workflow. We will assess the feasibility of the PEP in a single-arm pragmatic pilot study in which secure patient portal invitations containing a hyperlink to the PEP Web app are sent to 1000 patients. The primary outcome of the study is usability as measured by the System Usability Scale. RESULTS: Qualitative interviews with primary care providers were completed in April 2019. Qualitative interviews with patients will begin in December 2019. CONCLUSIONS: The PEP will leverage informatics and the patient portal to deliver evidence-based nonpharmacological treatment information to adults with chronic low back pain. Results from this study may help inform the development of Web-based health platforms for other pain and chronic health conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite expanded legalization and utilization of medical cannabis (MC) internationally, there is a lack of patient-centered data on how MC is used by persons living with chronic conditions in tandem with or instead of prescription medications. This study describes approaches to use of MC vis-a-vis prescription medications in the treatment of selected chronic conditions. DESIGN: Participants completed semistructured telephone interviews with open-ended questions. Content analysis of qualitative data identified themes and subthemes relating to patient approaches to using MC products. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty persons (mean age = 44.6 years) living with a range of chronic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, spinal cord injury/disease, and cancer) who had qualified for and used MC in Illinois. RESULTS: Participants described a range of approaches to using MC, including (1) as alternatives to using prescription or over-the-counter medications; (2) complementary use with prescription medications; and (3) as a means for tapering off prescription medications. Motives reported for reducing or eliminating prescription medications included concerns regarding toxicity, dependence, and tolerance, and perceptions that MC improves management of certain symptoms and has quicker action and longer lasting effects. CONCLUSIONS: MC appears to serve as both a complementary method for symptom management and treatment of medication side-effects associated with certain chronic conditions, and as an alternative method for treatment of pain, seizures, and inflammation in this population. Additional patient-centered research is needed to identify specific dosing patterns of MC products associated with symptom alleviation and produce longitudinal data assessing chronic disease outcomes with MC use.

AB  - The U.S. population aged \u003eor=65 years is estimated to grow from 35 million in 2000 to 71.5 million in 2030, and the number of those aged \u003eor=85 years is expected to increase from 5.3 million in 2006 to 21 million in 2050. Due to this demographic shift, the complexities of chronic pain management in the elderly will become increasingly important, necessitating a deeper understanding in the medical community of both the normal physiologic changes that occur with aging and the increased risks and vulnerabilities to pain that may be related to illness, comorbidities, or cognitive impairment. A number of factors complicate treating pain in the elderly. First, the cause of pain is often a condition that is typically not reversible. Second, effective treatment can be hampered by side effects of medications and complications from polypharmacy. Furthermore, depression, behavioral changes, and cognitive impairment commonly complicate therapy and make assessment more difficult. Both inappropriate prescribing and medication underuse are common in the elderly, as is the undertreatment of pain in this patient population in different care settings. The goal of this paper was to review appropriate use of nonpharmacologic, complementary, and alternative therapies for the comprehensive management of pain in older adults.

AB  - Sociologists have tended to frame medical gatekeeping as an exclusionary social practice, delineating how practitioners and clerical staff police the moral boundaries of medicine by keeping out patients who are categorised as 'bad', 'deviant', or otherwise problematic. Yet medical gatekeeping, understood more broadly, can include not only keeping patients out of particular clinical settings, but also redirecting them to alternative sources of care. In this article, I draw on qualitative analysis of audio-recorded patient-provider interactions in a United States emergency department (ED) to illustrate medical gatekeeping as a two-step process of, first, categorising certain patient complaints as unsuitable for treatment within a particular setting, and second, diverting patients to alternative sites for care. I refer to these as the restrictive and facilitative components of medical gatekeeping to denote how each relates to patients' access to care, recognising that both components of medical gatekeeping are part of a coordinated organisational strategy for managing resource scarcity. By illustrating how ED providers reveal intimate knowledge of structural vulnerabilities in diverting socioeconomically disadvantaged patients with chronic back pain to clinical sites that are better equipped to provide care, I suggest that we rethink the emphasis on restrictive practices in sociological accounts of medical gatekeeping.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether an Internet-based cognitive behavioural intervention would have an effect on the symptoms of chronic back pain. DESIGN: Experimental design with a treatment group and a control group measured before and after a treatment period. SUBJECTS: Participants who met the criteria for chronic back pain (n = 54). METHODS: All participants were screened in a live, structured interview before inclusion. The study period was 12 weeks and the treatment consisted of education, cognitive skills acquisition, behavioural rehearsal, generalization and maintenance. The main outcome of interest was the catastrophizing subscale of the Coping Strategies Questionnaire. RESULTS: There were statistically significant reductions from pre- to post-treatment in catastrophizing in the treatment group, and an improvement in quality of life for the treatment group. However, most outcome measures did not indicate a positive treatment outcome. On a scale measuring pain catastrophizing, 58% (15/26) of the treated participants showed reliable improvement, compared with 18% (5/28) of the control group. CONCLUSION: Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy can serve as a complement for individuals with chronic pain who prefer this treatment and have difficulties accessing specialist treatment facilities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Workers with chronic low back pain (LBP) mean a heavy human and social-economic burden. Their medical histories often include different treatments without attention to work-relatedness or communication with occupational health providers, leaving them passive and medicalized in (outpatient) health care. So we developed and implemented an innovative, patient-activating alternative: the multidisciplinary outpatient care (MOC) programme, including work(place) intervention and graded activity. It aims at function restore (instead of pain elimination), return to work (RTW) and coordinated communication. OBJECTIVES: To qualitatively explore how patients and health care providers perceive the programme effectiveness and which factors influence its implementation. METHODS: In-depth, semi structured interview with patients and focus groups of health care providers are used, all recorded, transformed into verbatim transcript and analysed. RESULTS: This qualitative study shows that although patients' expectations were low at the start of the program, and despite long LBP histories, including many different therapies, (primarily) directed at pain reduction, the MOC programme was successful in changing patients' goal setting from pain oriented towards function restore and RTW. The programme was therefore perceived as applicable and effective. Patient compliance was influenced by barriers - despair, supervisory and subordinate resistance at work, waiting period, medicalisation in health care - and facilitators: disciplinary motivation, protocolled communication, information supply, tailor-made exercises. For some patients the barriers were too high. Several improvement suggestions were given. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study shows that generally, patients and professionals perceived the multidisciplinary outpatient care programme as applicable and effective. After incorporating improvement suggestions this program seems promising for further, broader application and hypothesis testing. For those, negatively evaluating the programme, alternatives should be explored.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) has been used to identify people with back pain who have high levels of "fear of movement" to direct them into fear reduction interventions. However, there is considerable debate as to what construct(s) the scale measures. Somatic Focus and Activity Avoidance subscales identified in factor analytic studies remain poorly defined. Using a mixed methods design, this study sought to understand the beliefs that underlie high scores on the TSK to better understand what construct(s) it measures. METHODS: In-depth qualitative interviews with 36 adults with chronic nonspecific low back pain (average duration=7 y), scoring highly on the TSK (average score=47/68), were conducted. Following inductive analysis of transcripts, individuals were classified into groups on the basis of underlying beliefs. Associations between groups and itemized scores on the TSK and subscales were explored. Frequencies of response for each item were evaluated. FINDINGS: Two main beliefs were identified: (1) The belief that painful activity will result in damage; and (2) The belief that painful activity will increase suffering and/or functional loss. The Somatic Focus subscale was able to discriminate between the 2 belief groups lending construct validity to the subscale. Ambiguous wording of the Activity Avoidance subscale may explain limitations in discriminate ability. DISCUSSION: The TSK may be better described as a measure of the "beliefs that painful activity will result in damage and/or increased suffering and/or functional loss."

AB  - Synopsis Pain-related fear is implicated in the transition from acute to chronic low back pain and the persistence of disabling low back pain, making it a key target for physical therapy intervention. The current understanding of pain-related fear is that it is a psychopathological problem, whereby people who catastrophize about the meaning of pain become trapped in a vicious cycle of avoidance behavior, pain, and disability, as recognized in the fear-avoidance model. However, there is evidence that pain-related fear can also be seen as a common-sense response to deal with low back pain, for example, when one is told that one's back is vulnerable, degenerating, or damaged. In this instance, avoidance is a common-sense response to protect a "damaged" back. While the fear-avoidance model proposes that when someone first develops low back pain, the confrontation of normal activity in the absence of catastrophizing leads to recovery, the pathway to recovery for individuals trapped in the fear-avoidance cycle is less clear. Understanding pain-related fear from a common-sense perspective enables physical therapists to offer individuals with low back pain and high fear a pathway to recovery by altering how they make sense of their pain. Drawing on a body of published work exploring the lived experience of pain-related fear in people with low back pain, this clinical commentary illustrates how Leventhal's common-sense model may assist physical therapists to understand the broader sense-making processes involved in the fear-avoidance cycle, and how they can be altered to facilitate fear reduction by applying strategies established in the behavioral medicine literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robust outcome measures are needed to assess and monitor the impact of chronic low back pain (CLBP) on physical functioning. The Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) is a well-established measure designed to capture the impacts of back pain on everyday functioning, with a particular emphasis on physical functioning. It has documented evaluation of psychometric properties. However, there is no documented qualitative evidence to confirm the content validity of the tool, nor have changes made for electronic administration been debriefed in participants with CLBP. METHODS: In-depth, semi-structured, concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted with 23 US participants with confirmed CLBP. Interviews allowed participants to describe the impact of CLBP on their day-to-day functioning and discuss comprehension and suitability of the RMDQ. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing revealed the substantial burden associated with CLBP, highlighting 15 key areas of functional impact. These were grouped into overarching themes of mobility (walking, stairs, sitting/standing, bending/kneeling, lifting, lying down), activities (chores/housework, dressing, washing, driving, work) and other (relationships/socializing, mood, sleep, appetite), which are consistent with those evaluated within the RMDQ. All participants found the RMDQ to be relevant with most reporting that the instructions, recall period, and response options were suitable. A few suggested minor changes, however, none were consistent or necessary to support content validity. Updates to the measure for electronic administration and to clarify the response options were well received. CONCLUSION: The qualitative data from individuals with CLBP confirmed that the RMDQ has content validity and, alongside documented psychometric evidence, supports the use of the RMDQ as a reliable and valid tool to assess the impact of CLBP on physical functioning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High intercoder reliability (ICR) is required in qualitative content analysis for assuring quality when more than one coder is involved in data analysis. The literature is short of standardized procedures for ICR procedures in qualitative content analysis. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how ICR assessment can be used to improve codings in qualitative content analysis. METHODS: Key steps of the procedure are presented, drawing on data from a qualitative study on patients' perspectives on low back pain. RESULTS: First, a coding scheme was developed using a comprehensive inductive and deductive approach. Second, 10 transcripts were coded independently by two researchers, and ICR was calculated. A resulting kappa value of .67 can be regarded as satisfactory to solid. Moreover, varying agreement rates helped to identify problems in the coding scheme. Low agreement rates, for instance, indicated that respective codes were defined too broadly and would need clarification. In a third step, the results of the analysis were used to improve the coding scheme, leading to consistent and high-quality results. DISCUSSION: The quantitative approach of ICR assessment is a viable instrument for quality assurance in qualitative content analysis. Kappa values and close inspection of agreement rates help to estimate and increase quality of codings. This approach facilitates good practice in coding and enhances credibility of analysis, especially when large samples are interviewed, different coders are involved, and quantitative results are presented.

AB  - Anger may have greater effects on chronic pain severity than other negative emotions and may do so by increasing muscle tension near the site of injury (symptom-specific reactivity). For patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP), relevant muscles are lower paraspinals (LP). Ninety-four CLBP patients and 79 controls underwent anger and sadness recall interviews. EMG and cardiovascular activity were recorded. Patients exhibited greater LP tension increases during anger and slower recovery than controls. Only patients showed greater LP reactivity during anger than sadness. For both groups, trapezius reactivity during anger and sadness did not differ. LP reactivity to anger correlated with everyday pain severity for patients. Anger-induced symptom-specific LP reactivity may be linked to chronic pain aggravation among CLBP patients.

AB  - Objective: To determine the degree to which anger arousal and anger regulation (expression, inhibition) in the daily lives of people with chronic pain were related to spouse support, criticism, and hostility as perceived by patients and as reported by spouses. Method: Married couples (N = 105, 1 spouse with chronic low back pain) completed electronic daily diaries, with assessments 5 times/day for 14 days. On these diaries, patients completed items on their own anger arousal, anger expression, and inhibition, and on perceived spouse support, criticism, and hostility. Spouses reported on their responses toward patients and their negative affect. Hierarchical linear modeling tested concurrent and lagged relationships. Results: Patient-reported increases in anger arousal and anger expression were predominantly related to concurrent decreases in patient-perceived and spouse-reported spouse support, concurrent increases in patient-perceived and spouse-reported spouse criticism and hostility, and increases in spouse-reported negative affect. Relationships for anger expression remained significant with anger arousal controlled. These effects were especially strong for male patients. Spouses reported greater negative affect when patients were present than when they were not. Conclusions: Social support may facilitate adjustment to chronic pain, with declining support and overt criticism and hostility possibly adversely impacting pain and function. Results suggest that patient anger arousal and expression may be related to a negative interpersonal environment for married couples coping with chronic low back pain.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A 5-year longitudinal interview and questionnaire-based survey of back pain in adolescents. OBJECTIVES: To determine the natural history of back pain during adolescence in boys and girls and to explore the influence of sports participation and lumbar flexibility. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous data on low back pain and flexibility in adolescents have come largely from cross-sectional studies with differing definitions and age groups. A longitudinal study would offer a more detailed description of aspects of the natural history of back pain. METHODS: A cohort of 216 11-year-old children was given a structured questionnaire about back pain. Follow-up evaluation was annual for 4 more years. Lumbar sagittal mobility was measured in first and last years. Life-table analysis was the chosen statistical method. RESULTS: Annual incidence rose from 11.8% at age 12+ to 21.5% at 15+ years. Lifetime prevalence rose from 11.6% at age 11+ to 50.4% at age 15+ years. Experience of back pain was frequently forgotten. Recurrent pain was common, usually manifesting as such rather than as progression from a single episode; few children required treatment. Back pain was more common in boys than girls, especially by age 15 years. There was a positive link between sports and back pain only for boys. Severity and flexibility were not related to sex, treatment, or sport. CONCLUSIONS: Back pain in adolescents is common; it increases with age and is recurrent, but in general does not deteriorate with time. Much of the symptomatology may be considered a normal life experience, probably unrelated to adult disabling trouble.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to understand how people with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Italy experienced and managed chronic neuropathic pain (CNP), and their perspectives of Italian healthcare services. METHOD: Nine people with SCI participated. Two focus groups (three and four individuals) and one semi-structured interview were audio-recorded and transcribed. One "virtual interview" was conducted via e-mail. A qualitative thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified. First, participants experienced pain as a powerful, intrusive and, at times, inescapable force, with the potential to overwhelm the sense of self, and place limits on enjoyable experiences. Second, participants recounted a strong desire to understand CNP, and, in the absence of expert guidance, used trial-and-error methods to find ways of relieving pain. Third, healthcare practice was perceived as pharmacologically focused and lacking specialist knowledge. Practitioners were described as reluctant to explore alternative therapies or participate in collaborative, patient-centred care. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals SCI-related CNP as a deeply troubling and psychologically distressing condition impacting widely on everyday life. Specialist, collaborative, individually tailored rehabilitation approaches that attend to patients' priorities and experiences, include education about CNP, and offer opportunities to explore complementary treatments, may be welcomed by people living with this condition in Italy. Implications for Rehabilitation People living in Italy with SCI-related CNP describe inadequate and ineffective pain relief. The impact of CNP on physical, psychological and social functioning is significant but may be an issue that continues to be underestimated by health professionals. Health professionals may better support patients living in Italy with SCI-related CNP by providing long-term, individualized, collaborative and specialist support. Ongoing, patient-led discussion forums where experiences, ideas and information can be shared may be useful to persons with SCI to help them cope with their pain over the long-term.

AB  - Objectives: Appraisals and coping play important roles in musculoskeletal disorders, but how these aspects develop over time remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to examine the development of pain-related appraisals, coping and well behaviours among chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. Methods: Twenty-two outpatients (15 women, 7 men) of working age were interviewed about past and present experiences of CLBP. The interviews were analysed using Grounded theory. Results: The majority of the participants used disregarding processes in response to CLBP. The disregarding process developed from a psychological defence into a conscious coping strategy, the transition mediated by a crisis. This defence seemed to protect the participants' self-concept and reduce emotional discomfort, although it did not promote rehabilitation. The disregarding strategy was usually employed in later phases of the disorder and was consistent with active attempts at changing pain-related behaviours. Study limitation: Most of the participants had experienced CLBP for several years, thus the risk of memory bias cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the sample was composed of relatively healthy subjects, thus the findings may not apply to chronic low back patients in general. Conclusion: Acceptance of CLBP favoured rehabilitation and helped participants change pain-related behaviours.

AB  - RATIONALE: Spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) is an exemplar condition with a high prevalence of secondary complications, chronic conditions and use of multiple medications (polypharmacy). Optimizing medication self-management is important for persons with SCI/D to improve outcomes; however, there is a lack of research on how healthcare/service providers and persons with SCI/D experience medication self-management. OBJECTIVE: To explore attitudes and experiences of medication self-management from the perspectives of persons with SCI/D and providers, and to explore the extent to which the Taxonomy of Everyday Self-management Strategies (TEDSS) framework captured participants' experiences with medication self-management. METHODS: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone until data saturation was reached. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constant comparative approaches. The TEDSS framework was adapted and applied deductively. RESULTS: Fifty-one individuals participated in this study, 32 providers and 19 persons with SCI/D. Disease controlling strategies was the domain discussed in most detail by all participants. In this domain, participants discussed managing medications and treatments, monitoring/managing side effects, and controlling complications. Process strategies (problem-solving, decision-making) and resource strategies (seeking support) were the next most frequently discussed domains. Among all participant groups, there was a lack of detailed discussion of social interactions, health behaviour, and internal strategies. Medication self-management support was not extensively discussed by any group. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the complex nature of medication self-management. While persons with SCI/D and providers discussed similar components of the TEDSS framework, providers had minimal reflections on the impact of medication self-management on everyday life. This study identified the need for explicit discussions between providers and persons with SCI/D, involving all components of self-management and self-management support in order to improve medication self-management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate whether questionnaires identified all the self-reported patient outcomes raised in focus groups. DESIGN: Mixed methods research combined with qualitative analysis of focus groups. SETTINGS: Physical therapy clinic in a teaching hospital in Brazil. SUBJECTS: A total of 27 patients (aged >18 years, mean age 55.2 years) with chronic non-specific low back pain. INTERVENTIONS: Three focus groups were conducted by the same investigator and analyzed by meaning unit condensation. The results obtained from the focus groups were codified according to the International Classification of Functioning. A similar process was adopted to codify the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale and the Oswestry Disability Index according to the International Classification of Functioning. The results of both coding processes were compared. RESULTS: In the analysis, seven main concepts were identified, comprising 77 meaning units. Only three meaning units were not linked to the International Classification of Functioning. Most of the codes present in the questionnaires and focus groups represent limitations to activities. Some codes were identified in the questionnaires that were not mentioned by the focus group participants. No questionnaire assessed environmental factors or problems related to specific parts of the body, and very few assessed body function, all of which were issues raised in the focus groups. CONCLUSION: This study shows that not all fields considered important by patients to their function are being evaluated, and emotional and contextual factors should be included in clinical assessments in order to fully understand patient need.

AB  - Expectations of physiotherapy treatment of patients with persistent pain have been shown to influence treatment outcome and patient satisfaction, yet this is mostly explored and described in retrospective. The aim of the study was to explore and describe the expectations people with persistent pain have prior to physiotherapy treatment. Ten participants with persistent musculoskeletal pain from the back, neck, or shoulders were included in the study. Data were collected by interviews using a semi-structured interview guide and were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. The analysis resulted in one main category: "The multifaceted picture of expectations" and four categories: 1) Standing in the doorway: curious and uncertain; 2) Looking for respect, confirmation and knowledge; 3) Expecting treatment, regular training, and follow up; and 4) Having dreams, being realistic, or feeling resigned. The main category and the categories describe a multifaceted picture of the participants' expectations, gradually developed and eventually encompassing several aspects: good dialog and communication, the need to be confirmed as individuals, and getting an explanation for the pain. The results also show that the participants expected tailored training with frequent follow-ups and their expectations of outcome ranged from hope of the best possible results to realistic or resigned regarding pain relief and activity levels.

However, no previous randomized clinical trial has assessed the effectiveness of this form of care, nor has any study to date assessed when follow-up care begins after trial intervention and if the time to care and amount of care differed among trial treatment groups.Two hundred and thirty-five subjects who were previously randomized to either chiropractic care (flexion distraction) or physical therapy (exercise program) were followed for one year via mailed questionnaires to assess levels of pain (Visual Analog Scale) and dysfunction (Roland Morris) and via weekly structured telephone interviews regarding visitation of various health care practitioners and the practice of self-care for low back pain.Study subjects had a decrease in pain and disability after intervention regardless of which group they attended (p < 0.002), however during the year after care subjects who received chiropractic care (flexion distraction therapy) had significantly lower pain scores than subjects who received physical therapy (exercise program) (p = 0.02). The median number of weeks until care was sought from any health care provider after clinical trial intervention was approximately 16 weeks in the flexion distraction group and approximately 12 weeks in the exercise program group, demonstrating no significant difference in the timing of the initial care (p = 0.30). Subjects in the physical therapy group demonstrated on average significantly more visits to any health care provider during the year after trial care (p < 0.05). Nearly all subjects in both groups utilized some form of self-care during the year of follow-up.In this first trial on flexion distraction care, flexion distraction was found to be more effective in reducing pain for one year when compared to a form of physical therapy, and subjects previously randomized to physical therapy attended significantly more health care visits than those subjects who received chiropractic care. However, no significant group differences were noted in the timing of the first health care utilization during the one-year of follow-up.

AB  - Background: Previous clinical trials have assessed the percentage of participants who utilized further health care after a period of conservative care for low back pain, however no chiropractic clinical trial has determined the total amount of care during this time and any differences based on assigned treatment group. The objective of this clinical trial follow-up was to assess if there was a difference in the total number of office visits for low back pain over one year after a four week clinical trial of either a form of physical therapy (Exercise Program) or a form of chiropractic care (Flexion Distraction) for chronic low back pain.Methods: In this randomized clinical trial follow up study, 195 participants were followed for one year after a four-week period of either a form of chiropractic care (FD) or a form of physical therapy (EP). Weekly structured telephone interview questions regarded visitation of various health care practitioners and the practice of self-care for low back pain.Results: Participants in the physical therapy group demonstrated on average significantly more visits to any health care provider and to a general practitioner during the year after trial care (p<0.05). No group differences were noted in the number of visits to a chiropractor or physical therapist. Self-care was initiated by nearly every participant in both groups.Conclusions: During a one-year follow-up, participants previously randomized to physical therapy attended significantly more health care visits than those participants who received chiropractic care. © 2006 Cambron et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a stratified, random telephone survey of adults in North Carolina. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of chronic low back pain and the extent to which treatment is sought for this condition. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Chronic low back pain is a major problem. Previous studies often have combined acute and chronic back pain. METHODS: Telephone interviews regarding back pain were conducted with 4437 North Carolina adults during 1992. RESULTS: Chronic back pain affects 3.9% of the North Carolina population. Thirty-four percent considered themselves permanently disabled and 52% assessed their overall health as fair or poor. The median number of bed-disability days per year was three. Seventy-three percent saw a health care provider. Of those who sought care, 91% saw a medical doctor, 29% saw a physical therapist, and 25% saw a chiropractor. Use of technology was extensive: 37% received a computed tomography scan, 25% received a magnetic resonance imaging scan, and 10.4% underwent surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic back pain is common, and the level of care-seeking and costs of care among those afflicted are extremely high.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Telephone interviews were conducted with a random sample of adults in 4437 North Carolina households. The response rate was 79%. OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of low back pain and the correlates of care-seeking in a defined population were examined. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous research on low back pain has used varying definitions of the illness of low back pain, and has admixed patients with acute and chronic low back pain. Acute low back pain was examined in this study as a distinct phenomenon separate from chronic low back pain. METHODS: Respondents completed a detailed interview regarding the occurrence of and care sought for back pain in 1991. Acute back pain was defined as functionally limiting pain lasting less than 3 months. RESULTS: From this sample, 485 individuals had at least one occurrence of acute severe low back pain in 1991, representing 7.6% of the adult population. Symptoms were reported less commonly in individuals older than age 60 years (5% vs. 8.5%) and in nonwhites compared with whites (5% vs. 8.5%). Thirty-nine percent of those with back pain sought medical care; 24% sought care initially from an allopathic physician, 13% from a chiropractor, and 2% from other providers. More prolonged pain, more severe pain, and sciatica were associated with care-seeking. Gender, income, age, rural residence, and health insurance status did not correlate with the decision to seek medical care. Younger age, male gender, and nonjob-related pain did correlate with the decision to seek care from a chiropractor. CONCLUSIONS: Acute back pain is common. Care is often sought regardless of income and insurance status. Seeing a health care provider for acute back pain may not be discretionary from the perspective of the patient.

AB  - Objective: To explore the relationship between type of initial care as well as the likelihood of recurrence and consequent care seeking behavior.Research Design: Prospective observational cohort recruited from 208 randomly selected North Carolina practices. Cohort study examined the recurrence of low back pain among patients free of back pain 3 months after their index visit to a practitioner for that problem. The following four practitioner strata were examined: primary care providers, chiropractors, orthopedic surgeons, and practitioners in a group model HMO. Patients were interviewed by telephone at 6 and 22 months after the initial visit.Main Outcome Measures: Rates of disabling and non-disabling low back pain; functional status using the Roland back disability scale; and care seeking.Results: Rates of recurrence were substantial; functionally disabling recurrence rates varied between 8% and 14% between 3 to 6 months, and 20% to 35% between 6 to 22 months. Differences in rates among practitioner strata were statistically significant only between 6 to 22 months with higher recurrence rates for HMO patients. Functional status, number of bed days, and time off work were very similar among the practitioner strata. Care seeking, however, was greater among those patients who had initially seen a chiropractor for their back pain. Patients with recurrence saw the same practitioner type they had seen for the index episode 88% of the time. Satisfaction was slightly greater for patients who saw chiropractors when compared with patients seeing allopathic physicians.Conclusions: The recurrence of low back pain is common. Severe disability is rare. Patients who had sought care from chiropractors are more likely to return for recurrences than patients who had initially sought care from MDs.

AB  - Study Design: A 22-month prospective cohort study.Objectives: To describe the course of an inception cohort of patients with chronic low back pain.Summary Of Background Data: Chronic low back pain is a debilitating condition with great medical and social cost.Methods: A cohort of 1246 patients with acute low back pain who sought treatment from 208 North Carolina providers was observed. Patients who developed chronic low back pain were identified. Entry criteria were back pain of less than 10 weeks' duration, no previous care for this episode of low back pain, no previous spine surgery, not pregnant, no nonskin malignancy, and access to a telephone. The providers were of four types: primary care medical doctors, doctors of Chiropractic, orthopedic surgeons, and health maintenance organization-based primary care providers. Patients were contacted by telephone shortly after enrollment and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks, with a final interview at 22 months. Patient functional status, care-seeking, and satisfaction were evaluated.Results: Ninety-six patients had chronic, continuous symptoms for 3 months, forming the inception cohort of chronic low back pain. A valid, reliable measure of back-specific functional disability also was used. Predictors of the development of chronicity were poor baseline functional status and sciatica. A more powerful predictor of chronicity was poor functional status at 4 weeks. Two thirds of patients with chronic low back pain at 3 months had functionally disabling symptoms at 22 months, and a majority of these were employed. Satisfaction with care was low. Forty-six patients (2.6% of the entire cohort) underwent surgery, with no statistically significant difference in surgical rates among initial provider strata. Patients who underwent surgery after 3 months had a Roland disability score at 22 months of 10 (7.7, 12.3). Forty-one percent of patients with chronic low back pain see an orthopedic or neurologic surgeon. Chronic low back pain occurs in 7.7% of patients who seek care for acute low back pain, with unremitting pain for 22 months in 4.7%.Conclusion: Once established, chronic low back pain is persistent. Most patients with chronic low back pain seek little care, and a majority are employed. Future research should emphasize maintenance of employment and function.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, telephone survey of a representative sample of North Carolina households in 2006. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of these analyses were to describe health care use (providers, medications, treatments, diagnostic tests) for chronic low back pain (LBP) and relate current patterns of use to current best evidence for care of the condition. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Chronic LBP is common and expensive. Prior research on care utilization often was derived from medical claims databases, reflecting reimbursed health care use, often by one payer. METHODS: Five thousand three hundred fifty-seven households were contacted in 2006 to identify 732 noninstitutionalized adults 21 years and older with chronic LBP. Five hundred ninety individuals sought care. Patient reported health care utilization, comparison with efficacy was demonstrated by current systematic reviews. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic back pain were middle-aged (mean age 53 years), and the majority were women (62%). Provider and treatment use was common and varied. Sixty percent used narcotics in the previous month. The mean number of provider visits was 21, and over one-third had an advanced imaging procedure in the past year. Physical treatments were common, and often not supported by evidence. Only 3% had engaged in a formal spine rehabilitation program. Half of patients not taking antidepressants were positive on a 2-item depression screen. Although this study was population-based, it was conducted in only one state. CONCLUSION: Provider and treatment use for chronic LBP are both very common and varied. Current treatment patterns are consistent with overutilization of some medications and treatments, and underutilization of exercise and depression treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Active foot disease persists in a high proportion of people with psoriatic arthritis despite the availability of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to modify the course of the disease. Limited information exists on the provision of health care for foot disease in psoriatic arthritis. The objective of this study was to explore the views of health professionals on the assessment and management of people with psoriatic arthritis-related foot involvement. METHODS: Convenience sampling was used to recruit health professionals working in rheumatology outpatient clinics in Sydney, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. Three focus groups were undertaken to explore the views and experiences of health professionals on the assessment and management of foot problems in people with psoriatic arthritis. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative data was analysed using a constant comparative analytic approach to identify themes. RESULTS: A total of seventeen health professionals participated including rheumatologists, podiatrists and a physiotherapist. Key themes derived from the focus groups suggest that health professionals perceived that people with psoriatic arthritis-related foot problems experience suboptimal management from symptom onset, to diagnosis and treatment. Frustration was expressed throughout discussions relating to lack of appropriate training and expertise required for the specialised management of foot problems typically encountered with psoriatic arthritis and poor access for patients to specialist podiatry services. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insight into the perspectives of health professionals on the management of foot problems related to psoriatic arthritis. Deficiencies in the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of foot problems were revealed. To meet the foot health needs of people with psoriatic arthritis, reducing diagnostic delay, improving knowledge and awareness about the disease among people with psoriatic arthritis and health professionals, and increasing specialist podiatry service provision may be required.

AB  - Qualitative research methods that focus on the lived experience of people with health conditions are relatively underutilised in physiotherapy research. This article aims to introduce interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), a research methodology oriented toward exploring and understanding the experience of a particular phenomenon (e.g., living with spinal cord injury or chronic pain, or being the carer of someone with a particular health condition). Researchers using IPA try to find out how people make sense of their experiences and the meanings they attach to them. The findings from IPA research are highly nuanced and offer a fine grained understanding that can be used to contextualise existing quantitative research, to inform understanding of novel or underresearched topics or, in their own right, to provoke a reappraisal of what is considered known about a specified phenomenon. We advocate IPA as a useful and accessible approach to qualitative research that can be used in the clinical setting to inform physiotherapy practice and the development of services from the perspective of individuals with particular health conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (LBP) accounts for the majority of the disability and costs for LBP. However, the definition of chronicity is unclear. AIM: To elicit practitioners' definitions of chronic LBP patients, both in general and in the patients they were treating; to assess the most common characteristics of these practitioners' chronic LBP patients; and to assess the stability of chronicity in a sample of the general population. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 practitioners working in private practice, 71 LBP patients and their therapists, and 252 employees of a chain store who were assessed yearly in a prospective study. RESULTS: The therapists' definitions of chronic LBP patients generally included psychosocial aspects. Only physical symptoms and signs were stressed in the patients they were treating. These patients displayed common characteristics with reference to pain, functional problems, and contact with health care services. Duration of symptoms was not sufficient to define chronicity. In the employee population, chronicity defined according to pain duration was unstable. However, the same was true when chronicity was measured according to the criteria defined in the patient population. CONCLUSION: There is a discrepancy between theory and practice regarding the definition of chronic LBP. This discrepancy concerns not only the literature but also clinical practice itself. The term 'chronic' LBP as currently used is therefore equivocal.

AB  - AIM: Spinal instability is often disregarded as a cause of chronic low back pain and until now there has been no agreement as to its definition and on its nosologic importance or as to a conservative therapeutic protocol. The authors aim to verify whether possible symptomatological characteristics are reflected in radiological findings and, although there is no univocal opinion on the utilization of orthoses of containment for unstable segments, they also aim to verify their efficacy on pain control and neuromotor performance when employed in isolation or in association with the most reliable rehabilitation techniques. METHODS: Forty-eight patients between the ages of 30 and 50 were entered in the study, selected with special exclusion criteria and appropriately randomized to a group following kinesitherapy (KT) and orthoses (O) (O+KT group) and to a control group (orthoses [O] group); the symptomatological and instrumental characteristics were studied at time intervals 0 (t0), 3 months (t3), 6 months (t6), and 12 months (12t). RESULTS: The samples examined present homogeneous characteristics. Lumbar instability pain is related to the presence of shift and not to hypermobility, when the latter is guided by efficient neuromotor feedback. In the O+KT group, treatment achieves the two-fold results of reducing shift and increasing mobility in the absence of pain. Both groups tend to increase the utilization of a brace over time. Furthermore, in the O+KT group, a marked reduction in the use of medicine is noticed. CONCLUSIONS: Following treatment both groups report a decrease in pain even though the results of neuromotor performance prove to be better in the group following KT.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are used to capture patient perspectives in disease assessment. The objective of this study was to capture feedback about commonly used PROMs for spondyloarthritis (SpA) through semi-structured group discussions with individuals diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The goal was to identify PROM content that most resonated with patient experiences and is therefore suitable for implementation in SpA clinical practice. METHODS: Semi-structured tasks and probes were designed to elicit qualitative patient feedback on several general health and disease-specific PROMs. During a series of in-person and telephone meetings, participants with PsA or AS were asked to identify content that resonated with them and to identify items that may not have captured their personal experiences living with their disease. Both individualized and small group review and concept elicitation were captured after participant review of PROMs. RESULTS: Both PsA and AS participants identified concepts that reflected their experiences living with a chronic disease, including fatigue, isolation, depression, inter-personal relationships, and sexual intimacy. Constructs incorporated into existing PROMs, such as pain, physical function, ability to perform activities of daily living, and stiffness, were also identified as important to participants. There were a few qualitative differences in participant perceptions about what they would like to see addressed by PROMs. For example, AS participants said that they would like to see PROMs elicit feedback about their experiences with pelvic and chest pain (e.g., as a result of chest inflammation/tenderness and chest expansion). PsA participants felt that PROMs should include measures about the embarrassment and shame that they experience as well as the impact of PsA on their daily lives. CONCLUSION: Results of these qualitative assessments suggest that PROMs should be incorporated more frequently in outpatient settings to help improve the quality of decision-making conversations between patients and their healthcare providers. Participants indicated that constructs such as isolation, depression, fatigue, and relationships with others were critical to inform healthcare professionals about the patient experience of living with their disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare providers play a key role in supporting people with chronic low back pain to self-manage their condition. The study aimed at exploring how health care providers understand and conceptualize self-management and how they provide self-management support for people with chronic low back pain in Ethiopia. METHODS: Health care providers who have supported people with low back pain, including medical doctors and physiotherapists, were approached and recruited from three hospitals in Ethiopia. This study employed an interpretive descriptive approach using semi-structured interviews. FINDINGS: Twenty-four participants (7 women; 17 men) with a median age of 28 (range 24 to 42) years and a median of 9.5 years (range 1 to 11 years) of helping people with chronic low back pain were interviewed. Seven major themes related to health care providers' understanding of self-management support for people with chronic low back pain in Ethiopia emerged. The findings show that self-management was a new concept to many and health care providers' had a fragmented understanding of self-management. They used or suggested several self-management support strategies to help people with CLBP self-manage their condition without necessarily focusing on enhancing their self-efficacy skills. The participants also discussed several challenges to facilitate self-management support for people with chronic low back pain. Despite the lack of training on the concept, the providers discussed the potential of providing self-management support for people with the condition. CONCLUSIONS: Self-management was a new concept to health care providers. The providers lack the competencies to provide self-management support for people with chronic low back pain. There is a need to enhance the health care providers' self-management support competencies through training.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence and correlates of depression among Chinese peritoneal dialysis patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, from October 2007 to June 2008, 141 peritoneal dialysis patients were recruited from a local renal clinic. All participants were interviewed by the first author using the Chinese bilingual version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Axis I) to identify patients suffering from major depressive disorders and psychiatric illnesses associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected. Co-morbid medical illnesses and perceived social support were assessed by standardised questionnaires, namely: the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, and the Chinese version of Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSSC). RESULTS: The point prevalence of a current major depressive episode was 16%; another 21% had had at least 1 past episode of major depression. Low MSPSS-C score, muscle cramps, chronic back pain, joint stiffness, and receipt of Social Security Allowance were independent correlates of elevated depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression was higher in Chinese patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. Independent correlates are useful to help physicians identify patients suffering from depressive disorders in busy renal clinics.

AB  - Living well with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires people to manage disease-related symptoms in order to participate in activities of daily living. Mindfulness practice is an intervention that has been shown to reduce symptoms of chronic disease and improve accurate symptom assessment, both of which could result in improved disease management and increased wellness for people with COPD. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate an 8-week mindful meditation intervention program tailored for the COPD population and explore the use of breathing timing parameters as a possible physiological measure of meditation uptake. Results demonstrated that those randomized to the mindful meditation intervention group (N=19) had a significant increase in respiratory rate over time as compared to those randomized to the wait-list group (N=22) (P=0.045). It was also found that the mindful meditation intervention group demonstrated a significant decrease in level of mindfulness over time as compared to the wait-list group (P=0.023). When examining participants from the mindful meditation intervention who had completed six or more classes, it was found that respiratory rate did not significantly increase in comparison to the wait-list group. Furthermore, those who completed six or more classes (N=12) demonstrated significant improvement in emotional function in comparison to the wait-list group (P=0.032) even though their level of mindfulness did not improve. This study identifies that there may be a complex relationship between breathing parameters, emotion, and mindfulness in the COPD population. The results describe good feasibility and acceptability for meditation interventions in the COPD population.

AB  - Sleep disturbances are common during the aging process and can result in a reduced quality of life. Many older people who experience sleep disturbances would consider turning to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) due to the limitations of traditional pharmaceutical or psychological and behavioural treatments. Mindfulness Meditation (MM) and Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) are two common forms of mind-body based CAM. The former focuses more on mind-based practices whereas the latter emphasizes predominantly on body or movement-based practices. An etiological model of sleep disturbance (Shallcross et al., 2019) can lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the mechanisms of MM and TCC in relation to sleep disturbances. This study aims at comparing the effects of MM and TCC with Sleep Hygiene Education (SHE) control group. A three-armed randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted involving 45 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 to 82 with symptoms of sleep disturbance. Moderate effect sizes (Cohen’s d = 0.7 and 0.56) were found for the primary outcome of insomnia severity at post-intervention as comparing MM and TCC groups with SHE control group, respectively. More specific, participants in the MM group showed more amelioration on mental health status, introspective awareness, and objective measure of EEG-based brain arousal level; whereas participants in the TCC group showed better improvement on physical health status and subjective measure of hyperarousal. Findings demonstrate the unique therapeutic effects of MM and TCC on improving sleep problem in older people. The application in a Chinese context will be discussed.

AB  - Background: Recent evidence has shown that chronic back pain (CBP) can lead to functional alterations in the circuitry underlying the cognitive control of pain. Thought suppression (TS) is a common type of cognitive control of pain. Previous research has shown that TS has paradoxical effects that may increase the awareness of pain. Pain-related TS may also increase individuals' attention to pain, which may also increase pain sensation, but thus far, the relationship between pain-related TS and structural brain alterations is unknown.Methods: In this study, we investigated a group of 30 patients 6 months after lumbar disc surgery by applying voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify brain regions correlated with TS scores.Results: Since pain-related TS has been positively correlated with depression, all calculations were controlled for depression and age. VBM revealed a negative correlation between the TS score and regional grey matter volume (GMV) in the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) and the left middle temporal gyrus (L MTG), which is part of the left temporoparietal junction (L TPJ). In addition, a mediation analysis revealed a significant mediation effect of the pain-related TS on the association between GMV of the left TPJ and reported pain intensity in the last 7 days.Conclusions: These findings are consistent with previous research on the dysfunctional cognitive control of pain and may therefore provide potential insights into the neural substrates of obstructive cognitive control in chronic low back pain, with a special emphasis on pain-related TS.Significance: The link between pain-related thought suppression and brain morphology may provide a new perspective on the understanding of cognitive control of pain in chronic low back pain, which may help improve cognitive behavioural therapy.

AB  - Background: Chronic back pain is a major public health problem and the primary reason patients seek acupuncture treatment. Therefore, an objective assessment of acupuncture efficacy is critical for making informed decisions about its appropriate role for patients with this common condition. This study addresses methodological shortcomings that have plagued previous studies evaluating acupuncture for chronic low back pain.Methods and Design: A total of 640 participants (160 in each of four arms) between the ages of 18 and 70 years of age who have low back pain lasting at least 3 months will be recruited from integrated health care delivery systems in Seattle and Oakland. They will be randomized to one of two forms of Traditional Chinese Medical (TCM) acupuncture needling (individualized or standardized), a "control" group (simulated acupuncture), or to continued usual medical care. Ten treatments will be provided over 7 weeks. Study participants and the "Diagnostician" acupuncturists who evaluate participants and propose individualized treatments will be masked to the acupuncture treatment actually assigned each participant. The "Therapist" acupuncturists providing the treatments will not be masked but will have limited verbal interaction with participants. The primary outcomes, standard measures of dysfunction and bothersomeness of low back pain, will be assessed at baseline, and after 8, 26, and 52 weeks by telephone interviewers masked to treatment assignment. General health status, satisfaction with back care, days of back-related disability, and use and costs of healthcare services for back pain will also be measured. The primary analysis comparing outcomes by randomized treatment assignment will be analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline value. For both primary outcome measures, this trial will have 99% power to detect the presence of a minimal clinically significant difference among all four treatment groups and over 80% power for most pairwise comparisons. Secondary analyses will compare the proportions of participants in each group that improve by a clinically meaningful amount.Conclusion: Results of this trial will help clarify the value of acupuncture needling as a treatment for chronic low back pain.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials.gov NCT00065585.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal manipulation and acupuncture can be helpful in reducing the symptoms of musculoskeletal (MSK) pain. Both approaches are currently recommended by NICE as treatment options for patients with persistent low back pain. However, there has been no previous evaluation of a GP service using them together for MSK pain. The purpose of this study was to evaluate acceptability and outcomes for an osteopathy and acupuncture service (delivered by complementary therapy practitioners) for patients with MSK problems provided within a General Practice. METHODS: Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire before and after their course of treatment. Outcome measures included the Bournemouth Questionnaire (measuring MSK problems), EuroQoL-5D (measuring quality of life), medication use, physical activity and general well-being. Non-parametric tests were used to compare pre- and post- treatment variables. Qualitative data, regarding participants' views on the service, were collected from patients via a service survey and healthcare professionals via interviews. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 123 adults with MSK problems were referred into the service (79 female and 44 male, mean age 49 years). Complete patient questionnaire data sets (pre- and post- treatment) were available for 102 participants; 91 completed a service survey. All healthcare professionals involved in the service participated in interviews including all seven GPs and the administration manager at the practice, as well as the three acupuncture/osteopathy practitioners. Patient outcomes: comparisons between pre and post-treatment revealed a statistically significant improvement in MSK pain (p < 0.0001) and quality of life (p < 0.0001), and a statistically significant reduction in medication use (p < 0.0001). Qualitative analysis found that patients reported improvements in their MSK pain, mobility, other physical health conditions, well-being and self-management of their MSK problem.Acceptability of the service: overall patients and healthcare professionals were satisfied with the service and its provision within the Practice. Patients reported wanting increased appointment availability and flexibility, and more sessions. Complementary therapy practitioners reported finding the high number of referrals of chronic patients challenging, and wanting increased communication with GPs. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of acupuncture and osteopathy for MSK pain is achievable in General Practice. A GP surgery can quickly adapt to incorporate complementary therapy provided key principles are followed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Supported self-management, acupuncture and information can help reduce the symptoms of low back pain. These approaches are currently recommended by NICE guidance as treatment options for patients with persistent low back pain. However, there has been no previous evaluation of a service providing them together for this common problem. The purpose of this service evaluation was to report patient outcomes and experiences of the Beating Back Pain Service (BBPS), a pilot service based in a primary and community care setting, delivering acupuncture, self-management and information to patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: Patients completed a questionnaire at three time points: pre-BBPS, immediately post-BBPS and three months post-BBPS. Outcome measures included the Bournemouth Questionnaire (measuring musculoskeletal, MSK, problems), EuroQoL-5D (measuring quality of life), Pain and Self-efficacy Questionnaire, and additional questions on medication use, physical activity, understanding of pain and positive well-being. Additionally, the STarT Back (measuring risk of developing chronic pain) was collected at BBPS information sessions. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate pre- and post- variables. Questionnaires also collected qualitative data (open-text responses) regarding patient views and experiences of the BBPS, which were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: 80 (out of 108) patients who attended the initial BBPS information session agreed to participate in the service evaluation (mean age 47 years, 65% female). 65 patients attended subsequent BBPS acupuncture and/or self-management sessions and were asked to complete post-treatment questionnaires; complete datasets were available for 61 patients. There were statistically significant improvements over time for pain (p <0.0001), quality of life (p = 0.006), understanding of pain (p <0.001), physical activity (p = 0.047) and relaxation (p = 0.012). Post-hoc analysis revealed that scores improved between baseline and post-treatment, these improvements were maintained at 3-month follow-up (except relaxation). Patients receiving a combination of acupuncture and self-management sessions produced the most positive results. Patient satisfaction with the BBPS was high. CONCLUSIONS: The BBPS provided a MSK pain management service that many patients found effective and valuable. Combining self-management with acupuncture was found to be particularly effective, although further consideration is required regarding how best to engage patients in self-management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a symptom commonly presented to GPs, accounting for a significant proportion of their workload. It is also a common reason for sickness absence, and thus of national economic importance. OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study aimed to provide an understanding of how GPs understood CLBP, how they approached the consultation with CLBP patients and how they conceptualized the management of this problem. METHOD: Qualitative research techniques were employed. Twenty GPs working in North-West England were interviewed. Interviews were semi-structured and recorded on audio-tape. Transcripts of these interviews were then subjected to constant comparative qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Subjects described their difficulties in responding to and managing CLBP. They acknowledged the link between CLBP and psychological distress, and that it legitimizes long-standing illness behaviour. They were pessimistic about the chances for successful cure or palliation of CLBP. CONCLUSION: Subjects seemed to be cognisant of collusion between doctor and patient, in cases where the patient's explanatory model of back pain is not challenged. We argue that this can be accounted for by the patient operating within a physical model of pain causation, while doctors operate using a model that stresses psychosocial factors. The incommensurability of these models lies at the root of the CLBP consultation as a problem.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Qualitative research methods are recognized increasingly as valuable tools for primary care research, and add an extra dimension to quantitative work. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate the benefits and problems attending the dual role of clinician/qualitative researcher. METHODS: As part of two studies employing semi-structured interviews of GPs in a North-West conurbation, about the topics of consultations on chronic low back pain and drug misuse in primary care, respondents' views on their interaction with a GP researcher were explored. RESULTS: Access to the GP by the interviewing GP was easier when the GP researcher was known to the respondent. Such prior knowledge, however, may then influence the content of the data and the manner in which the GP researcher is perceived. During the interview itself, where respondents recognized the researcher as a clinician, interviews were broader in scope and provided richer and more personal accounts of attitudes and behaviour in clinical practice. The GP was also identified as an expert and judge, not just of clinical decision making but also about moral judgements made by GPs in their work. This will impact on the data obtained at interview and must be taken into consideration when the data are interpreted and analysed. CONCLUSION: Qualitative research techniques increasingly are advocated as appropriate for research on and in general practice. The professional identity of the researcher plays an important part in constructing the kind of data obtained in such studies, and this must be made apparent in reporting and discussions of such qualitative work.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of chronic pain care provided to vulnerable older persons. DESIGN: Observational study evaluating 11 process-of-care quality indicators using medical records and interviews with patients or proxies covering care received from July 1998 through July 1999. SETTING: Two senior managed care plans. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 372 older patients at increased risk of functional decline or death identified by interview of a random sample of community dwellers aged 65 and older enrolled in these managed-care plans. MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of quality indicators satisfied for patients with chronic pain. RESULTS: Fewer than 40% of vulnerable patients reported having been screened for pain over a 2-year period. One hundred twenty-three patients (33%) had medical record documentation of a new episode of chronic pain during a 13-month period, including 18 presentations for headache, 66 for back pain, and 68 for joint pain. Two or more history elements relevant to the presenting pain complaint were documented for 39% of patients, and at least one relevant physical examination element was documented for 68% of patients. Treatment was offered to 86% of patients, but follow-up occurred in only 66%. Eleven of 18 patients prescribed opioids reported being offered a bowel regimen, and 10% of patients prescribed noncyclooxygenase-selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications received appropriate attention to potential gastrointestinal toxicity. CONCLUSION: Chronic pain management in older vulnerable patients is inadequate. Improvement is needed in screening, clinical evaluation, follow-up, and attention to potential toxicities of therapy.

AB  - Acupuncture and meditation are promising treatment options for clinical pain. However, studies investigating the effects of these methods on experimental pain conditions are equivocal. Here, the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) and meditation on the submaximum effort tourniquet technique (SETT), a well-established, opiate-sensitive pain paradigm in experimental placebo research were studied. Ten experienced meditators (6 male subjects) and 13 nonmeditators (6 male subjects) were subjected to SETT (250 mmHG) on one baseline (SETT only) and two treatment days (additional EA contralaterally to the SETT, either at the leg on ST36 and LV3 or at the arm on LI4 and LI10 in randomized order). Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ratings (scale 0–10) were recorded every 3 min. During baseline, meditation induced significantly greater pain tolerance in meditators when compared with the control group. Both the EA conditions significantly increased pain tolerance and reduced pain ratings in controls. Furthermore, EA diminished the group difference in pain sensitivity, indicating that meditators had no additional benefit from acupuncture. The data suggest that EA as a presumable bottom-up process may be as effective as meditation in controlling experimental SETT pain. However, no combined effect of both the techniques could be observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Central sensitisation pain is a predominant mechanism in a proportion of individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain and is associated with poor outcomes. It is proposed that the pre-morbid experiences and contexts may be related to the development of central sensitisation. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to explore the pre-morbid experiences and personal characteristics of participants with central sensitisation pain from a non-specific chronic low back pain population. METHODS: This was a qualitative, exploratory study, using a concurrent nested design within a mixed methods protocol. n=9 participants were recruited purposively based on sensory profiles and trait anxiety-related personality types. Data were collected through semi structured interviews, managed using QSR NVivo 10 software and analysed using theoretical thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four themes emerged: developmental learning experiences, personal characteristics, sensitivity and trauma. Reported was lack of confidence, low esteem and a need to please others, physical hyper-sensitivities (smell, light, sound) and emotional sensitivity (anxiety) as well as physical hypo-sensitivity. Participants had also suffered emotional and/or physical trauma. Learning difficulties, sensory sensitivities and trauma are associated with autonomic stress responses, which in turn have been linked to physiological changes seen in central sensitisation pain. CONCLUSION: Central sensitisation pain developed in the context of sensory processing differences related to learning difficulties, sensitivities and trauma, and personal characteristics of low confidence and control, in a group of participants with non-specific chronic low back pain. The role of pre-existing sensory processing differences, as a component of altered central nervous system function, in relation to central sensitisation pain warrants further investigation.

AB  - Introduction: The multigenerational health considerations and negative economic impacts related to the opioid epidemic are many. Increasing numbers of opioid-related fatalities are bolstered by barriers related to access to evidence-based treatment. Ohio is ranked second in the country for number of opioid-related deaths, and for many their treatment needs remain unmet due to impaired access to effective treatment, in rural, medically underserved areas of the state. Purpose: The goal of this study was to assess opioid use disorder treatment barriers in order to increase access to evidence-based treatment, wrap around services, and harm reduction efforts to support the reintegration of persons with substance use disorder back into society and subsequently reduce opioid fatalities in a rural, medically underserved region of Ohio. Methods: As part of a larger mixed-methods study design where a community health survey was randomly distributed to residents in a rural county in Ohio, this study used qualitative methods to triangulate findings. To supplement the data received from the surveys, 20persons with a diagnosed opioid use disorder (OUD) took part in focus group sessions guided by trained researchers. The sessions were transcribed, and the data was analyzed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis method. Results: Three major themes emerged from the data: epigenetics and exposure, management of disease including re-integration into society, and disease process. The participant data created insight regarding the need to recognize OUD as a chronic condition that must be addressed with integrated components of medical, behavioral, and mental health morbidities throughout the lifespan and across generations. Conclusions: Findings from this study support the need for targeted interventions for integrated care and improved wrap around services such as transportation, sober living, and employment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traction is used to treat low-back pain (LBP), often with other treatments. OBJECTIVES: To determine traction's effectiveness, compared to reference treatments, placebo, sham traction or no treatment for LBP. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 4), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL to October 2006, references in relevant reviews and personal files. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving traction to treat acute (less than four weeks duration), sub-acute (four to 12 weeks) or chronic (more than 12 weeks) non-specific LBP with or without sciatica. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection, methodological quality assessment and data extraction were done independently by two authors. As there were insufficient data for statistical pooling, we performed a qualitative analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 RCTs (2206 patients; 1045 receiving traction). Five trials were considered high quality. For patients with mixed symptom patterns (acute, sub-acute and chronic LBP with and without sciatica) there is: strong evidence of no statistically significant difference in outcomes between traction as a single treatment and placebo, sham or no treatment; moderate evidence that traction as a single treatment is no more effective than other treatments; limited evidence of no significant difference in outcomes between a standard physical therapy program with or without continuous traction. For LBP patients with sciatica (with acute, sub-acute or chronic pain), there is conflicting evidence in several comparisons: autotraction compared to placebo, sham or no treatment; other forms of traction compared to other treatments; different forms of traction. In other comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences; the evidence is moderate for continuous or intermittent traction compared to placebo, sham or no treatment, and limited for light versus normal force traction. Authors' conclusions: IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results of the available studies involving mixed groups of acute, sub-acute and chronic patients with LBP with and without sciatica were quite consistent, indicating that continuous or intermittent traction as a single treatment for LBP is not likely effective for this group. Traction for patients with sciatica cannot be judged effective at present either, due to inconsistent results and methodological problems in most studies. We conclude that traction as a single treatment for LBP is probably not effective. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Any future research on traction for patients with LBP should distinguish between symptom pattern and duration, and should be carried out according to the highest methodological standards.

AB  - A cross-sectional population-based study was conducted to identify the prevalence of common mental disorders and verify the association with chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the self-reported number of chronic diseases. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was applied in a multi-stage random sample of 1,276 adults aged 40 and older. Socio-demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables were also obtained using a structured questionnaire. Prevalence of common mental disorders was 30.2%. Lower schooling and social class and the 46-55-year age bracket were associated with psychiatric morbidity. Each chronic illness was independently associated with common mental disorders. However, a stronger association was found between common mental disorders and the total number of self-reported chronic conditions, with a prevalence ratio of 4.67 (95%CI: 3.19-6.83) for five or more self-reported NCDs. The current study emphasizes the importance of common mental disorders in chronically ill patients, particularly in those with more total chronic conditions.

AB  - In the United States, chronic pain is often poorly treated at an exceedingly high cost. The use of the biomedical model to manage pain is frequently ineffective, and evidence suggests that the biopsychosocial (BPS) model is a better choice. A problem with the BPS model is that it has not been operationalized in terms of patient behavior. This commentary addresses that issue by suggesting that people with chronic pain and illness participate daily in four self-management health behaviors: socialize, work, exercise, and meditation, and discusses evidence that supports these recommendations. These self-management behaviors may decrease pain and thus reduce the need for pain medications and other medical interventions. Additional topics include patient adherence and health coaching.

AB  - Objectives\r\n\r\nDespite an ageing population and an increased prevalence of chronic pain, the relationship between chronic pain and the concept of successful ageing is unclear. The aim of the present research was to explore older people\u0027s views on past and present experiences of pain, and its management, and how these experiences relate to their perceptions of successful ageing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nSemi-structured interviews with six participants, aged 75 years or older, who considered themselves to have aged successfully, explored what this concept meant to them and their experiences of pain. Data analysis used methods drawn from grounded theory. The themes reported in this article are ‘understanding of pain’ and ‘perceptions of ageing’.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nNone of the participants recalled painful experiences that were not attributable to physical trauma. They believed that pain is part of life and a natural consequence of the ageing process. While some accepted this with little resistance, others felt frustration at what they considered a dismissive attitude towards older people experiencing pain from healthcare practitioners. The concept of successful ageing was previously unfamiliar to participants, and their conceptualization of ageing derived from comparing themselves with their peers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nThe findings of the present study suggest that predictable experiences of pain as one ages may contribute to an acceptance of pain as a biomedical certainty, a belief reinforced both by health professionals and society. However, one may have chronic pain and yet consider oneself to have aged successfully, and it should therefore be recognized that there is a distinction between having pain and having a problem with pain.

AB  - Learning to meditate as an older adult can be difficult given the decreased ability to inhibit distractions in the elderly, and the important role of dealing with distractions in several types of meditation practice. Designing technologically assisted meditation practices in general is an area that is only beginning to be explored, and this is especially true for these kinds of technologies for older adults. In order to better design support for meditation practices for such a population we performed a qualitative study of 9 meditators aged 55+ in order to understand their specific needs, followed by a pilot study of a device which we designed in order to address these needs. Our analysis of these interviews yielded three themes. First was that there was an initial difficulty and discouraging experience when performing focused attention exercises which comprise a significant part of a beginner’s meditation practice. Second was a difficulty understanding when you are “doing it right” and how to make sense of teachings. Third was an openness to making use of new technologies and ways of supporting their meditation practice as long as the new support does not interfere with what they considered the core parts of meditation to be. We then use these results to outline design considerations for a neurofeedback application to address these needs.

AB  - A mixed-methods approach was used to study an individually-tailored community exercise program for people with a range of chronic neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease) and abilities. The program was delivered to older adults (mean age: 62 +/- 9 years) with chronic neurological conditions across a 12-week and an 8-week term. Participants attended 88% of sessions and completed 89% of prescribed exercises in those sessions. There were no adverse events. Clinically important improvements were achieved by all evaluated participants (n = 8) in at least one testing domain (grip strength, lower-extremity strength, aerobic endurance, and balance). Interviews with participants identified key program elements as support through supervision, social connection, individualized programming, and experiential learning. Findings provide insight into elements that enable a community exercise program to meet the needs of a complex and varied group. Further study will support positive long-term outcomes for people aging with neurological conditions.

AB  - Abstract Objective  To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a training programme for peer volunteers to support older adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP) following discharge from physiotherapy. Design  Feasibility study.  Setting  Community-based.    Participants  17 adults (4 male, 13 female) with CLBP or experience of supporting someone with CLBP enrolled and 12 (2 male, 10 female) completed the volunteer training.    Intervention  Volunteers took part in a face-to-face or blended delivery peer support training programme based on the Mental Health Foundation’s “Principles into Practice” and adapted for CLBP by the study team.    Main outcome measures  Recruitment/retention rates; demographics; time \u0026 resources used to deliver training; training evaluation (questionnaire); knowledge questionnaire, and self-efficacy questionnaire.    Results  17 participants enrolled on the training programme (11 face-to-face, 6 blended delivery). 12 (71%) completed the training (73% face-to-face, 67% blended delivery). The training was positively evaluated. All but two participants passed the knowledge quiz at the end of the training, and the majority of self-efficacy scores (90%) were high.    Conclusions  It is feasible to develop, implement and evaluate a peer support training programme for the facilitation of CLBP self-management in older adults following discharge from physiotherapy. Blended delivery of training may facilitate the recruitment of greater numbers of peer support volunteers in future studies. Supported self-management of CLBP pain is widely recommended but can be difficult to achieve. Peer support might be a promising method of facilitating CLBP self-management without additional burden to health services, and should be further evaluated in a larger study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: (i) Examine the feasibility and acceptability of a peer support intervention (PALS) to facilitate self-management in community dwelling older adults with Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP), and (ii) examine the feasibility of study methods in order to inform the design of a future randomised controlled trial. DESIGN: Mixed methods feasibility and acceptability study. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: 18 older adults (aged 65 to 79) with CLBP and 6 peer support volunteers (PSVs) aged 34 to 65. INTERVENTION: Six sessions of 1 to 3hours duration, approximately 2 weeks apart, delivered in mutually convenient public places, or by telephone. Each session had a suggested topic and each participant and PSV had a PALS manual detailing aims and target outcomes for each session. OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment, retention, integrity, acceptability and feasibility of the PALS intervention, feasibility of study processes, appropriateness and usefulness of outcome measures. RESULTS: We recruited to target and retained 2/3 of participants. PALS was delivered as intended and acceptable to people with CLBP and PSVs. Most participants were satisfied with PALS and would recommend it to someone else with CLBP. Study processes worked well, but recruitment procedures need to be refined. Outcome measures were returned and were mostly complete, but further work on the most appropriate measures is required. CONCLUSIONS: PALS was feasible to deliver and acceptable to the older people and PSVs who took part in this study. We identified amendments to PALS and the study processes that, once implemented, will allow the effectiveness of PALS to be tested in a large-scale study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A new set of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of low back pain (LBP) and prevention of persistent disability entitled "Clinic on Low back pain in Interdisciplinary Practice" (CLIP) was developed in the province of Quebec, Canada. The literature shows that simply disseminating CPGs does not necessarily lead to their adoption by clinicians. To improve adherence to CPGs among healthcare professionals, the literature suggests that there is a need to identify and address the factors impeding or facilitating their use. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the barriers to and facilitators of CLIP CPG use, as perceived by physiotherapists (PTs). METHODS: A descriptive study using a qualitative method was conducted with a sample of 16 PTs from a variety of professional backgrounds. Each participant used the CPGs over a 6-week period with two patients suffering from LBP, and then participated in a semi-structured interview in which he or she was asked to identify the barriers and facilitators experienced. RESULTS: The participating PTs identified many barriers and facilitators pertaining to the guidelines themselves, the users and the environment. Four key nodes emerged from these barriers and facilitators during data analysis. It appears that the clinicians' understanding of the CPGs, the level of compatibility between their practices and the CLIP CPG recommendations, the level of CPG relevance as perceived by the clinicians, and their level of agreement with the CPGs, all affected their use of the guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: In order to increase CLIP CPG use, the implementation strategy to be developed should take into account the barriers and facilitators that were identified in this study.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this research is to understand the important components of client-centred rehabilitation from the perspective of adult clients with long-term physical disabilities.Method: Focus groups were conducted with adult clients who had completed at least one course of rehabilitation in the publicly-funded rehabilitation system in Ontario. Data were analysed using an iterative inductive approach.Results: The major theme underlying all of the participants' comments was the need for better transitions between rehabilitation programs and the community. Participants felt ill-prepared for community living and the emotional challenges of living with a long-term condition and, once discharged from rehabilitation, felt isolated and had difficulty finding out about and accessing community services.Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that client-centred rehabilitation encompasses much more than goal-setting and decision-making between individual clients and professionals. It refers to a philosophy or approach to the delivery of rehabilitation services that reflects the needs of individuals and groups of clients. This entails a shift from an acute-illness, curative model to one that acknowledges the long-term nature of the career of chronic illness or disability. Definitions of evidence that is deemed credible need to be broadened beyond expert, 'scientific' evidence to include multiple dimensions of evidence including the expertise of the client.

AB  - The study of the fascial system is of increasing interest to researchers and clinicians. The aim of this paper is to explore how physiotherapists integrate the Danis Bois Method (DBM) Fasciatherapy into their daily practice and whether or not it contributes to pain management. A questionnaire with 2 closed questions (assessing their view on the effectiveness of fasciatherapy in the reduction of physical pain and mental suffering) and 2 open-ended questions (which type(s) of pain are best treated) was sent to 446 French physiotherapists trained as DBM fasciatherapists. The DBM Fasciatherapy trained physiotherapists express a strong sense of improvement of their effectiveness on both physical pain and psychical suffering. This improvement is most noticeable on headaches, neck pain, acute low back pain, chronic low back pain, and migraines. This study gives an insight into the value of using the DBM Fasciatherapy in the management of pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physiotherapists have been urged to embrace a patient-oriented biopsychosocial (BPS) framework for the management of non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). However, recent evidence suggests that providing broader BPS interventions demonstrates small differences in pain or disability compared to usual care. Little is known about how to integrate a BPS model into physiotherapy practice and the challenges it presents. OBJECTIVE: To explore the perceptions of physiotherapists' in primary care in England adopting a BPS approach to managing NSCLBP patients. METHOD: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten physiotherapists working in primary care. A purposive sampling method was employed to seek the broadest perspectives. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts and capture the emergent themes. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: (1) physiotherapists recognised the multi-dimensional nature of NSCLBP and the need to manage the condition from a BPS perspective, (2) addressing psychological factors was viewed as challenging due to a lack of training and guidance, (3) engaging patients to self-manage their NSCLBP was seen as a key objective. CONCLUSION: Although employing a BPS approach is recognised by physiotherapists in the management of NSCLBP, this study highlights the problems of implementing evidence based guidelines recommending that psychological factors be addressed but providing limited support for this. It also supports the need to allocate more time to explore these domains in distressed individuals. Engaging patients to self-manage was seen as a key objective, which was not a straightforward process, requiring careful negotiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has long been acknowledged that nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) is associated with a complex combination of biopsychosocial (BPS) factors, and recent guidelines advocate that the management of back pain should reflect this multidimensional complexity. Cognitive functional therapy (CFT) is a behaviourally oriented intervention that targets patients' individual BPS profiles. Although the efficacy of CFT has been demonstrated in primary care, little evidence exists about the training requirements of this approach. METHODS: Qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 physiotherapists working in primary care, who had undergone a formal training programme in CFT. A purposive sampling method was employed to seek the broadest perspectives. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview transcripts and capture the emergent themes. RESULTS: Five main themes emerged: (i) the learning challenge; (ii) self-reported changes in confidence; (iii) self-reported changes in communication practice; (iv) self-reported changes in attitudes and understanding; (v) the physiotherapists felt that CFT was more effective than their usual approach for NSCLBP but identified barriers to successful implementation, which included a lack of time and difficulties in engaging patients with strong biomedical beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggested that training in CFT has the capacity to produce self-reported changes in physiotherapists' attitudes, confidence and practice. The provision of such training has implications in terms of time and costs; however, this this may be warranted, given the physiotherapists' strong allegiance to the approach compared with their usual practice.

AB  - Guidelines advocate a combined physical and psychological approach to managing non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP), referred to as psychologically informed practice (PIP). PIP is underpinned by patient-centered principles and skilled communication. Evidence suggests that a physiotherapist-focused style of communication prevails in physiotherapy. There is a recognized need for observational research to identify specific communication practices in physiotherapy interactions. This observational study explored the interactional negotiation of agenda setting following a PIP training intervention, by identifying and describing how physiotherapists solicit and respond to the agenda of concerns that patients with NSCLBP bring to primary care initial encounters. The research setting was primary care. Nineteen initial physiotherapy consultations were video-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using conversation analysis, a qualitative observational method. These data revealed a patient-focused style of communication where trained physiotherapists demonstrated a collaborative and responsive style of verbal and nonverbal communication to solicit, explore, and validate patients' concerns.

AB  - <b>Background</b>: Guidelines advocate that non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) be considered within a multi-dimensional bio-psychosocial (BPS) framework. This BPS approach advocates incorporating the patient's perspective as part of the treatment process. 'Agenda setting' has been introduced as the key to understanding patients' concerns in medical encounters; however, this has received little attention in physiotherapy. This study explored how physiotherapists solicit and respond to the agenda of concerns that patients with NSCLBP bring to initial encounters. <b>Method</b>: The research setting was primary care. Twenty initial physiotherapy consultations were video-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using conversation analysis, a qualitative observational method. Both verbal and non-verbal features of the interaction were considered. <b>Results</b>: This data highlights a spectrum of communication styles ranging from more physiotherapist-focused, where the physiotherapists did not attend to patients' concerns, to a more patient-focused style, which provided greater opportunities for patients to voice their concerns. On occasions, patients were willing to pursue their own agenda when their concern was initially overlooked. <b>Conclusion</b>: This study provides empirical evidence on communication patterns in physiotherapy practice. A more collaborative style of communication with a shared conversational agenda provided patients with the conversational space to describe their concerns more fully.

AB  - Aim To synthesize qualitative descriptions of the experience of chronic pain across conditions. Background Chronic pain is a transdiagnostic symptom in that while somatic pathology plays a role in activating pain pathways, psychological and social factors contribute to the experience of pain over time. The treatment of the underlying condition may require both biomedical intervention and biopsychosocial approaches. Design Qualitative meta-synthesis using Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research ( CERQual) developed by Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation ( GRADE) working group to evaluate the strength of the evidence. Data sources PubMed and Ovid Medline from 2000-2015. Review methods Following a systematic search strategy all papers were assessed in relation to inclusion criteria and quality. Themes were extracted from each study and a meta-synthesis conducted before completing an evaluation of confidence in the findings. Results Forty-one papers exploring the experience of chronic pain were included in the review. Five meta-themes were identified across the studies: 1) the body as obstacle; 2) invisible but real; 3) disrupted sense of self; 4) unpredictability; and 5) keeping going. There was high confidence in the evidence for three themes: 'the body as obstacle'; 'disrupted sense of self' and 'keeping going'; and moderate confidence in the evidence for 'invisible but real' and 'unpredictability'. Conclusions The findings in this review suggest there are similarities in the experience of chronic pain across a range of conditions that have implications for the development of transdiagnostic pain management strategies and interventions.

AB  - Chronic pain and depression are two of the most common health problems that health professionals encounter, yet only a handful of epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship between these conditions in the general population. In the present study we examined the prevalence and correlates of major depression in persons with chronic back pain using data from the first cycle of Canadian Community Health Survey in a sample of 118,533 household residents. The prevalence of chronic back pain was estimated at 9% of persons 12 years and older. Rates of major depression, determined by the short-form of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, were estimated at 5.9% for pain-free individuals and 19.8% for persons with chronic back pain. The rate of major depression increased in a linear fashion with greater pain severity. In logistic regression models, back pain emerged as the strongest predictor of major depression after adjusting for possible confounding factors such as demographics and medical co-morbidity. The combination of chronic back pain and major depression was associated with greater disability than either condition alone, although pain severity was found to be the strongest overall predictor of disability.

AB  - Background: Pain has been considered to be the most disabling symptom of musculoskeletal disorders. It is the cause of a large number of medical consultations and high health costs around the world. Chronic back pain affects a larger population than other types of pain, with observed prevalence of between 53% and 81%; this has economic, clinical and social repercussions for the health system. Objective: The purpose of the present article is to describe the utility and the neurobiological mechanisms of verbal suggestion as a therapeutic ally during the management of patients with musculoskeletal pain. Important discoveries: Inducing expectations by means of verbal suggestions can activate placebo or nocebo pathways when the clinical professional uses either positive or negative words respectively. When the administration of drugs and physiotherapy interventions are accompanied by words which induce positive expectations, this may improve certain clinical parameters such as pain and/or function in people suffering low back pain. Equally important, the use of positive verbal suggestion may decrease the perception of pain in patients with osteoarthritis. Conclusions: In the management of clinical musculoskeletal pain, the inclusion of verbal suggestion has the potential to induce expectations which may generate hypoalgesia through the placebo effect; however, more research is needed to determine the magnitude and clinical significance of this contribution.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop an instrument to assess attitudes and underlying beliefs about back pain, and subsequently investigate its internal consistency and underlying structures. DESIGN: The instrument was developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and researchers based on analysis of qualitative interviews with people experiencing acute and chronic back pain. Exploratory analysis was conducted using data from a population-based cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Qualitative interviews with community-based participants and subsequent postal survey. PARTICIPANTS: Instrument development informed by interviews with 12 participants with acute back pain and 11 participants with chronic back pain. Data for exploratory analysis collected from New Zealand residents and citizens aged 18 years and above. 1000 participants were randomly selected from the New Zealand Electoral Roll. 602 valid responses were received. MEASURES: The 34-item Back Pain Attitudes Questionnaire (Back-PAQ) was developed. Internal consistency was evaluated by the Cronbach alpha coefficient. Exploratory analysis investigated the structure of the data using Principal Component Analysis. RESULTS: The 34-item long form of the scale had acceptable internal consistency (alpha=0.70; 95% CI 0.66 to 0.73). Exploratory analysis identified five two-item principal components which accounted for 74% of the variance in the reduced data set: 'vulnerability of the back'; 'relationship between back pain and injury'; 'activity participation while experiencing back pain'; 'prognosis of back pain' and 'psychological influences on recovery'. Internal consistency was acceptable for the reduced 10-item scale (alpha=0.61; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.66) and the identified components (alpha between 0.50 and 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The 34-item long form of the scale may be appropriate for use in future cross-sectional studies. The 10-item short form may be appropriate for use as a screening tool, or an outcome assessment instrument. Further testing of the 10-item Back-PAQ's construct validity, reliability, responsiveness to change and predictive ability needs to be conducted.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. OBJECTIVE: Explore attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions related to low back pain (LBP) and analyze how these might influence the perceived threat associated with back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Psychological factors that contribute to the perceived threat associated with LBP play an important role in back pain development and the progression to persistent pain and disability. Improved understanding of underlying beliefs may assist clinicians to investigate and assess these factors. METHODS: Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 12 participants with acute LBP (<6-wk duration) and 11 participants with chronic LBP (>3 mo duration). Data were analyzed thematically using the framework of Interpretive Description. RESULTS: The back was viewed as being vulnerable to injury due to its design, the way in which it is used, and personal physical traits or previous injury. Consequently, participants considered that they needed to protect their back by resting, being careful with or avoiding dangerous activities, and strengthening muscles or controlling posture. Participants considered LBP to be special in its nature and impact, and they thought it difficult to understand without personal experience. The prognosis of LBP was considered uncertain by those with acute pain and poor by those with chronic pain. These beliefs combined to create a negative (mis)representation of the back. CONCLUSION: Negative assumptions about the back made by those with LBP may affect information processing during an episode of pain. This may result in attentional bias toward information indicating that the spine is vulnerable, an injury is serious, or the outcome will be poor. Approaching consultations with this understanding may assist clinicians to have a positive influence on beliefs. Level of evidence: 3.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze attitudes and beliefs about movement and physical activity in people with low back pain (LBP) and compare these beliefs between people with acute and chronic LBP. DESIGN: Qualitative inductive analysis of data collected via face-to-face semistructured interviews. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. SETTING: Participants were purposively recruited from 1 region of New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with LBP (N=23), consisting of individuals with acute LBP (<6wk; n=12) and chronic LBP (>3mo; n=11). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Themes that emerged from participant interview transcripts using analysis based on Interpretative Description. RESULTS: Participants with acute and chronic LBP made judgments about physical activity and rest using the same conceptual model. Concerns about creating more pain, tissue damage, or impairment influenced the physical activity judgments of most participants with acute and chronic LBP. These perceived risks were balanced against the perceived benefits, the most important of which were psychological or social rather than physical. Judgments made by those with acute and chronic LBP were context dependent and influenced by the nature and duration of pain, the type of physical activity, the importance of the activity, and the participant's previous experience. Participants with acute pain who had not experienced back pain previously often expressed more uncertainty, whereas those with chronic LBP appeared to have developed cognitive rules that determined physical activity decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Exploring the perceived risks, benefits, and contextual factors that influence decisions about physical activity and rest may help clinicians to understand the behavior of patients with acute and chronic LBP. Clinicians may best support their patients to engage in physical activity by providing an informed assessment of risks and an explanation about the range of potential benefits.

AB  - Objectives To establish exercise prescription by individual therapists as well as the type and content of group exercise programmes used in clinical practice for management of chronic low back pain (CLBP). Introduction Group exercise programmes are a cost-effective treatment for managing CLBP but lack individualized exercise and education specific to the patient. Those patients for whom English is not their first language may be excluded from attending these programmes. Methods One hundred and fifty-four questionnaires were sent to 15 physiotherapy departments using convenience sampling within the Greater London area including 2 in independent practice. Closed questions and free response spaces provided were used to obtain information on exercise prescription and the content of group exercise programmes. Results There was a 63% response rate. Stretching, core stability, and lumbar stabilization were the most frequently used exercise types by individual therapists. Ninety seven percent of respondents utilized group programmes. Only 47% of all respondents were able to refer non-English speaking patients to the group programmes. The most frequently used group exercise was the Back to Fitness Programme. Group programmes generally lacked individualized exercises and education given on an individual basis. None of the group programmes offered manual therapy. Conclusions An alternative group physiotherapy programme should be considered alongside current programmes consisting of an individualized multimodal exercise programme carried over from the referring therapist. This group programme would consist of individual education sessions and manual therapy if appropriate. This would allow interpreters to be arranged for patients for whom English is not their first language.

AB  - Objectives: To compare a novel group physiotherapy exercise programme with a standard programme for managing chronic low back pain (CLBP) in primary care. Introduction: Group exercise programmes used in physiotherapy practice are a cost effective treatment for managing CLBP but currently lack a combination of individualized specific exercises, one-to-one education and manual therapy. A novel group exercise programme was designed to address these limitations. Methods: The novel group exercise programme (Group A) was compared to a standard group exercise programme used in clinical practice (Group B) in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial with focus groups. Participants with CLBP were allocated to the two programme groups by block randomization. Participants in both groups attended six one-hour programme sessions over a 3-month period. Outcomes measuring function (Functional Rating Index (FRI)), pain (Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)), quality of life (EQ-5D) and satisfaction with treatment were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the programmes pre- and post-programme attendance and at 6 months. Focus groups were used to explore patients' experiences regarding their treatment in the two group programmes. Results: Eighty-one participants were randomized to the two groups (41 in Group A; 40 in Group B). Both groups showed improvements to function, quality of life, and pain post treatment. There were no significant between-group differences in any outcomes post treatment and small effect sizes were found. Quality of life deteriorated in Group B at 6 months but continued to improve in the novel group. The within group analysis revealed significantly lower FRI and NPRS scores post-programme compared to pre-programme in both groups but these improvements were greater in the novel programme. EQ-5D scores were significantly higher in the novel programme post treatment but not in Group B. The focus group interviews showed that these group programmes provide social support but participants would like further guidance post treatment. Patients prefer individualized exercises as well as one-to-one education which are components of the novel programme. Conclusion: This novel programme may provide a suitable addition to existing programmes available for managing CLBP. It is recommended that this programme be further evaluated in clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose: Little is known about physiotherapists' pain beliefs and whether they influence behavior within therapeutic encounters with patients. This qualitative study explored physiotherapists' pain beliefs with the purpose of highlighting the nature of their beliefs and the role they played within their management of chronic low back pain.Methods: Six physiotherapists were purposefully sampled along with 12 of their patients with chronic low back pain (two patients each). A qualitative exploration of physiotherapists' pain beliefs within the context of a clinical situation was carried out using semistructured interviews and observations at designated stages throughout therapeutic encounters with their patients. The data were prepared and analyzed according to a grounded theory approach.Results: The themes that emerged from the data indicated that the pain beliefs of physiotherapists in this study were determined by a number of perspectives including their beliefs regarding the development of craft knowledge needed to manage chronic low back pain, beliefs regarding the clinical characteristics of patients with chronic low back pain they considered to be "good" to treat and the challenge of patients who were "difficult" to treat, and pain beliefs within the therapeutic encounter. A tentative theory was developed which proposed that the physiotherapists' biomedically oriented pain beliefs influenced their clinical reasoning processes including the explanations given to the patients.Conclusions: The findings suggest that in order to maximize the rehabilitation potential of patients with chronic low back pain, physiotherapists need to be aware that their pain beliefs may influence their management of these patients.

AB  - Background: Comorbidity is common in osteoarthritis (OA) and is predictive of limitations in daily functioning and a poor functional prognosis in patients with OA of the knee or hip. Exercise therapy has proven effective in reducing pain and improving daily functioning in these patients and is recommended in all treatment guidelines. However, these guidelines do not advise how exercise therapy should be adapted in the presence of comorbidity. Aim: To develop and evaluate an exercise therapy protocol for patients with knee/hip OA and comorbidity. Methods: A literature search was conducted and experts were consulted regarding restrictions and contraindications to exercise therapy for OA in the presence of comorbid type II diabetes mellitus (DM) or chronic low back pain (LBP). These restrictions were classified according to the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF). Adaptations to the diagnostic phase were suggested on the basis of findings. Results: For type II DM, most restrictions to exercise therapy were found within the ICF domain of body structure and function, signifying the importance of physiological problems in DM. For chronic LBP, most restrictions to exercise therapy were found within the personal factors domain and concerned psychological characteristics and behaviour. The diagnostic phase was adapted on the basis of these findings. Conclusion: Comorbidity results in specific restrictions and contraindications to exercise therapy for knee/hip OA. This knowledge will be used to modify the treatment (exercise therapy) protocol for patients with OA and comorbidity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies into the effect of pain experience on those who have it have largely focused on the views and interpretations of researchers gained by the use of assessment tools aimed at measuring pain. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe pain, as experienced by those with chronic back pain, and to document 'insider' accounts of how pain is perceived and understood by those who have it. METHOD: Unstructured interviews using the framework approach. Subjects were sampled for age, sex, ethnicity and occupation, from new referrals with back pain to a rheumatology outpatient clinic. Eleven subjects (5 M; 6 F) agreed to be interviewed. Interviews were unstructured, but followed a topic guide. Subjects were interviewed in English (nine) or their preferred language (two). Tape-recordings of interviews were transcribed verbatim and read in depth twice to identify the topics or concepts. Data were extracted in the form of words and phrases by use of thematic content analysis. The themes were pain description and amount of pain. An independent researcher reviewed the data and confirmed or contended the analysis. RESULTS: All subjects, except one, provided descriptors of the quality of their pain. The use of simile was common to emphasize both what the pain was, and what it was not. Five subjects expressed a loss of words in trying to describe their pain. Only 13 of 29 different pain descriptors used were commensurate with those in the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Melzack, 1983). Subjects had great difficulty quantifying their pain intensity. Several explained how the pain fluctuated, thus, quantifying pain at one point in time was problematic. Only one subject offered a numerical description of pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects provided graphic and in-depth descriptions of their pain experience, but these bore little resemblance to commonly used assessment tools. The findings challenge the appropriateness of such formal instruments.

AB  - Purpose. Back-related functional limitations are largely assessed using lists of activities, each scored on a yes/no basis and the scores then summed. This provides little information about how chronic back pain (CBP) patients live with their condition. This study describes the consequences of living day-to-day with CBP and documents the 'insider' accounts of its impact on daily life. Method. Unstructured interviews, using the 'Framework' approach with topic guide, were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Subjects were sampled for age, sex, ethnicity and occupation from new referrals with back pain to a rheumatology outpatient clinic. Eleven subjects (5 male, 6 female) were interviewed either in English (n = 9) or their preferred language (n = 2). Interviews were read in-depth twice to identify the topics. Data were extracted in phrases and sentences using thematic content analysis. Results. Four themes emerged: sleep/rest, mobility, independence and leisure. All subjects reported issues about sleep and rest, nine about mobility, seven about independence and six on leisure. Most descriptions concerned loss and limitation in daily life. Strategies for coping with sleep disruption and physical limitations were described. Conclusions. Subjects provided graphic 'in-depth' descriptions of experiences living with CBP every day; expressed regret at the loss of capabilities and distress at the functional consequences of those losses. Facilitating 'adjustment' to 'loss' may be more helpful than inferring the potential for a life free of pain as a result of therapeutic endeavours.

AB  - PURPOSE: The emotional distress caused by pain is one of the most disruptive aspects of living with the condition. This study investigates how individuals experience pain and its consequences for family life and work. METHOD: Unstructured interviews, using the 'Framework' approach with topic guide, were recorded and transcribed. Patients were sampled for age, sex, ethnicity and occupation from new referrals with spinal pain (SP) to a rheumatology outpatient clinic. Eleven patients (five males and six females) were interviewed in English (n = 9) or their preferred language (n = 2). Interviews were read in depth twice to identify the topics. Data were extracted in phrases and sentences using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Emergent themes reported were relationships with: spouses and partners (n = 7), children/parents (n = 6), with other family and friends (n = 7) and work-related issues (n = 11). Patients valued support from family but expressed concerns about causing them worry. Work-related issues included physical and emotional efforts to keep working when in pain, fear of losing employment and financial problems. CONCLUSION: Patients expressed anxiety about how their pain affected other family members, regret at losing full work capacity and worry about financial consequences. The lived experience of chronic SP has ramifications that go beyond the individual, reaching into work and social relationships.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the psychometric properties and utility of the Appraisals of DisAbility Primary and Secondary Scale-Short Form (ADAPSS-sf), a measure of cognitive appraisals, among adults with pediatric-onset SCI. To examine the relation of the ADAPSS-sf to demographics, injury characteristics, and secondary health and psychosocial outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A structured telephone interview was conducted to obtain measures of ADAPSS-sf, pain, sleep, secondary health complications, and psychosocial functioning. SETTING: Community in United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals who sustained an SCI at 18 years of age or younger (N = 115) were initially interviewed at age 19 years or older and followed annually. RESULTS: Study findings support sound psychometrics of the ADAPSS-sf. The measure demonstrated strong test-retest reliability and internal consistency. There were no differences on ADAPSS-sf scores in relation to current age, gender, race, etiology, injury severity, or injury level. Individuals who sustained SCI at an older age were more likely to endorse negative appraisals of their injury. Results suggest that higher negative SCI-related appraisals were related to higher mental health difficulties. Negative SCI-related appraisals were associated with sleep difficulties, pressure injuries, pain, distress from pain, and poor overall subjective ratings of health. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the use of the ADAPSS-sf in a pediatric-onset SCI adult population by demonstrating its good internal validity, test-retest reliability, convergent and face validity, and brevity. Moreover, the current study revealed that such appraisals are associated with both psychosocial and secondary health outcomes, further supporting the ADAPSS-sf as a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is one of the most common, disabling, and expensive public health problems in the United States. Interdisciplinary pain management treatments that employ behavioral approaches have been successful in helping patients with chronic pain reduce symptoms and regain functioning. However, most patients lack access to such treatments. We are conducting a pragmatic clinical trial to test the hypothesis that patients who receive an interdisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention, the Pain Program for Active Coping and Training (PPACT), at their primary care clinic will have a greater reduction in pain impact in the year following than patients receiving usual care. METHODS/DESIGN: This is an effectiveness-implementation hybrid pragmatic clinical trial in which we randomize clusters of primary care providers and their patients with chronic pain who are on long-term opioid therapy to 1) receive an interdisciplinary behavioral intervention in conjunction with their current health care or 2) continue with current health care services. Our primary outcome is pain impact (a composite of pain intensity and pain-related interference) measured using the PEG, a validated three-item assessment. Secondary outcomes include pain-related disability, patient satisfaction, opioids dispensed and health care utilization. An economic evaluation assesses the resources and costs necessary to deliver the intervention and its cost-effectiveness compared with usual care. A formative evaluation employs mixed methods to understand the context for implementation in the participating health care systems. DISCUSSION: This trial will inform the feasibility of implementing interdisciplinary behavioral approaches to pain management in the primary care setting, potentially providing a more effective, safer, and more satisfactory alternative to opioid-based chronic pain treatment. Clinical Trials Registration Number: NCT02113592.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the notion of clinical medicine as a hermeneutical enterprise and to bridge the gap between the general perspectives of hermeneutics and the particularities of medical practice. The case of a patient with low back pain is analyzed. The discussion centers around the metaphor of "the patient as a text" and a model of five social discourses about low back pain. The problems addressed are: (1) the nature of a moral experience, (2) the variety of available texts, (3) the difference between the doctor's and patient's narratives, and (4) the patient's and doctor's responsibility regarding the existential, biographical meaning of an illness. Although many problems are left unsolved, it is argued that from a philosophical point of view the notion of medicine as a hermeneutical enterprise opens up the possibility of gaining insight in the foundations of the clinical encounter.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Endometriosis is a long term, disabling condition, and a common cause of chronic pelvic pain. Symptomatic disease is usually characterised by pelvic and abdominal pain, lower back pain, and dyspareunia, all of which may be severe and debilitating. Yet the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is frequently a number of years, and many women report negative experience within the primary care setting. This paper explores the experience of women with endometriosis in the primary care setting. STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative research design was considered appropriate to elicit the experience of endometriosis and the impact on women's lives. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 women who suffer with endometriosis. The sample was recruited via a dedicated endometriosis clinic in the English Midlands, and participants had all been diagnosed laparoscopically with endometriosis. RESULTS: Participants described diverse experiences within the primary care setting. Although some women reported a positive relationship with their general practitioner, over half had had negative experiences, which they felt had contributed to delays in them receiving a diagnosis of endometriosis. CONCLUSION: The delay in diagnosis can be reduced and perceived attitudes of general practitioners towards women presenting with endometriosis can be improved by being alert to certain symptomology, and by detailed and sensitive history taking.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the immediate analgesic effect of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) and interferential current (IFC), with different combinations of parameters, in individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHODOLOGY: 280 individuals with CLBP were included in the study, both genders, randomized in 8 groups: GI2KHz/100Hz, GI2KHz/2Hz, GI4KHz/100Hz, GI4KHz/2Hz, placebo interferential group (GIP), GT100Hz, GT2Hz, and placebo TENS group (GTP). All individuals underwent a single application of TENS or IFC for 30min. The assessments were carried out prior to the intervention, as well as immediately after, with the following outcomes: pain intensity (Numeric Pain Rating Scale-NPRS), qualitative pain characteristics (McGill Pain Questionnaire-MPQ), and pressure pain threshold (PPT) by pressure algometry (PA) in 4 points of the low back region. RESULTS: In the intergroup comparison of NPRS, all intervention groups showed greater pain reduction compared to GTP (p < 0.05). In the total MPQ score, the groups that obtained significant results (p < 0.05) when compared to GTP were GT100Hz and GT2Hz, while the groups GT100Hz and GI4KHz/100Hz were significant when compared to GIP. In the PA, GI4KHz/100Hz showed an increase in the PPT in all points compared to GTP and GI2KHz/100Hz. CONCLUSION: Both TENS and IFC presented immediate analgesic effect in CLBP, with emphasis on the interferential current of 4 KHz modulated at 100Hz.

AB  - Over a period of decades chiropractors have utilized spinal manipulation under anesthesia (SMUA) to treat chronic back and neck pain. As an advanced form of manual therapy, SMUA is reserved for the patient whose condition has proven refractory to office-based manipulation and other modes of conservative care. Historically, the protocols and guidelines put forth by chiropractic MUA proponents have served as the clinical compass for directing MUA practice. With many authors and MUA advocates having focused primarily on anticipated benefit, the published literature contains no resource dedicated to treatment precautions and contraindications. Also absent from current relevant literature is acknowledgement or guidance on the preliminary evidence that may predict poor clinical outcomes with SMUA. This review considers risk and unfavorable outcomes indicators in therapeutic decision making for spinal manipulation under anesthesia. A new risk classification system is proposed that identifies patient safety and quality of care interests for a procedure that remains without higher-level research evidence. A scale which categorizes risk and outcome potential for SMUA is offered for the chiropractic clinician, which aims to elevate the standard of care and improve patient selection through the incorporation of specific indices from existing medical literature.

AB  - Objective: To examine the information seeking behavior and health literacy of caregivers of individuals living with spinal cord injury in Switzerland and their impact on the caregiving experience.Methods: Nationwide survey of family caregivers of people with spinal cord injury (N = 717). Caregivers aged 18+ who assisted with activities of daily living were included. Self-reported information seeking behavior, including topics, preferred sources, and health literacy were assessed and analyzed.Results: Health professionals were the most trusted source of information. Among information-seekers, higher health literacy levels were shown to be associated with lower subjective caregiver burden and, in turn, with higher caregivers' satisfaction with own health.Conclusion: Caregivers use information on different topics and coming from different sources. In order for information to improve the caregiving experience, however, caregivers need health literacy skills to make sense of it.Practice Implications: Building health literacy is a promising approach to support caregivers in their activities, reduce their subjective burden, and even to improve their health. Interventions should consider involving health professionals, as the most trusted source of information, and address both health-related and more practical issues.

AB  - Study Design: This report describes a case of vertebral body osteonecrosis associated with the use of intradiscal electrothermal therapy.Objectives: To alert clinicians to a previously unreported complication, vertebral body osteonecrosis, after an intradiscal electrothermal therapy procedure.Summary Of Background Data: The intradiscal electrothermal therapy procedure is a new treatment that has been advocated in the management of chronic low back pain of discogenic origin. The intradiscal electrothermal therapy procedure uses a fluoroscopically guided thermal catheter to heat the intervertebral disc. A review of the literature regarding this procedure has not revealed osteonecrosis as a complication.Methods: The patient's work-up and postoperative course are documented, and all medical records were reviewed retrospectively.Results: The patient's pain had improved only minimally at initial follow-up after L5-S1 combined anterior and posterior spinal fusion, undertaken after intradiscal electrothermal therapy failure.Conclusions: Intradiscal electrothermal therapy has gained increasing popularity in the treatment of discogenic low back pain, in large part because of its minimally invasive nature and perceived low risk for major complications. Previous reports in the literature have not noted any major complications associated with the proper use of this device. Clinicians should be advised that intradiscal electrothermal therapy can be associated with complications, which in the current case, led to osteonecrosis of the vertebral body.

AB  - Study Design: A case report.Objectives: To report and discuss a case of contained rupture of the aneurysm of common iliac artery associated with pyogenic vertebral spondylitis, so that investigators and practitioners may avoid the diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls associated with pyogenic vertebral spondylitis and aortic disease.Summary Of Background Data: Pyogenic vertebral spondylitis is a rare disorder that may have serious consequences, including death, if it is not diagnosed promptly and treated effectively. The association of pyogenic vertebral spondylitis with infection of the aorta is a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical and medical therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a contained rupture of the aneurysm of common iliac artery case associated with pyogenic vertebral spondylitis resulting from an infection with Bacteroides fragilis,although Salmonellae infections are commonly associated with vertebral osteomyelitis and lesions of the contiguous aorta.Methods: A 60-year-old man with chronic lower back pain began to experience a severe pain and had increased difficulty in walking. An MRI scan showed an increased signal in the L4-L5 disc space and an abscess extending into the spinal canal. The presumptive diagnosis was infective spondylitis. While performing a CT-guided needle biopsy, an unexpected contained rupture of the aneurysm of common iliac artery was discovered.Results: A wide resection of all infected tissue, including the right common iliac artery and bony lesions, was performed in combination with antimicrobial therapy. A cryopreserved aortic allograft was used to reconstruct the artery, and an iliac strut graft was used to fill the debrided vertebral cavity. The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful.Conclusion: The coexistence of pyogenic vertebral spondylitis and lesions of the aorta is rare, but may be lethal if not diagnosed promptly and treated effectively. Even if a patient's condition is stable and the hematocrit is normal, it is important to consider the possibility of a contained rupture of a mycotic abdominal aneurysm in all patients with vertebral osteomyelitis who have acute episodes of unusual severe back pain. CT is sometimes more beneficial than MRI in the identification and characterization of contained rupture of aneurysms.

AB  - Background Chronic pain in later life is a worldwide problem. In younger patients, chronic pain affects life satisfaction negatively; however, it is unknown whether this outcome will extend into old age. Objective This study examines which factors determine life satisfaction in older adults who suffer from chronic pain with respect to socio-demographics, lifestyle behaviors, pain, and comorbidities. Methods This cross-sectional study recruited a random sample of people ≥65 years old living in south-eastern Sweden (N= 6611). A postal survey addressed pain aspects and health experiences. Three domains from the Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat-11) were used to capture the individual\u0027s estimations of overall satisfaction (LiSat-life), somatic health (LiSat-somhealth), and psychological health (LiSat-psychhealth). Results Respondents with chronic pain (2790, 76.2±7.4 years old) rated lower on life satisfaction than those without chronic pain, with medium effect size (ES) on LiSat-somhealth (r = 0.38, P \u003c 0.001) and small ES on the other two domains (r \u003c 0.3). Among the respondents with chronic pain, severe pain (OR 0.29-0.59) and pain spreading (OR 0.87-0.95) were inversely associated with all three domains of the LiSat-11. Current smoking, alcohol overconsumption, and obesity negatively affected one or more domains of the LiSat-11. Most comorbidities were negatively related to LiSat-somhealth, and some comorbidities affected the other two domains. For example, having tumour or cancer negatively affected both LiSat-life (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.88) and LiSat-somhealth (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.74). Anxiety or depression disorders had a negative relationship both for LiSat-life (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38-0.78) and LiSat-psychhealth (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06-0.14). Conclusion Older adults with chronic pain reported lower life satisfaction but the difference from their peers without chronic pain was trivial, except for satisfaction with somatic health. Pain management in old age needs to consider comorbidities and severe pain to improve patients\u0027 life satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between chronic pain patients' responses to self-report measures of pain intensity, and self-reported strategies when completing such measures. PARTICIPANTS: Ambulatory outpatients suffering from one of the following chronic pain conditions: painful HIV neuropathy, painful diabetic neuropathy, chronic Low-Back Pain. METHOD: As part of a previously reported study using qualitative methods, participants completed standard pain intensity questionnaires as well as a measure of pain related disturbances in activities of daily living. In the previous study, participants' responses during a focus group were then used to identify their strategies and beliefs about their approach to completing the questionnaires. Among the beliefs were: (1) difficulties averaging pain over different time periods (i.e., "what was your average pain during the last 24h" versus "what was your average pain during the last 2 weeks"); (2) difficulty in comparing pain from different etiologies; (3) difficulties in reporting sensations of pain in a manner unaffected by issues and situations secondary to the pain experience, such as difficulties in activities of daily living. In the present paper we use ANOVA (analysis of variance) and partial correlation to determine whether the qualitatively derived perceptions are reflected in the quantitative pain intensity scores. RESULTS: Participants' belief that it was difficult to "average" pain intensity over different time periods was supported. The data do not support their belief that pain intensity scores are affected by other factors: their specific pain diagnosis, and the extent to which pain interfered with their activities of daily living. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Patients tend to report different levels of pain intensity when asked to report their pain over different periods; (2) insofar as it can be said to exist, the relationship between measures of intensity and interference with activities of daily living is minimal; (3) participants tend to report similar levels of pain intensity, irrespective of etiology. IMPLICATIONS: (1) Chronic pain patients' elicited beliefs and strategies concerning how they complete pain intensity questionnaires are sometimes, but not invariably, reflected in their responses to these measures. Thus, purely qualitative methodologies alone cannot provide completely reliable information and point to the need to use a "mixed methods" approach combining both qualitative and quantitative data; (2) the lack of association between pain intensity measures and interference with activities of daily living, as well as relative insensitivity to different etiologies underlines the problem in relying on pain intensity measures as the primary means of evaluating the success of a treatment, either for pain management or in clinical research.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore medical doctors' views on what are barriers in providing rehabilitation services for persons with SCI in Mongolia. METHODS: A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted with 12 medical doctors. Participants were purposely sampled. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s report International Perspectives on Spinal Cord Injury was chosen as a guide to structure the interviews. The study used inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Five barriers in the provision of rehabilitation services were identified: low awareness and limited knowledge regarding SCI and rehabilitation issues, inadequate rehabilitation policies, deficiencies in infrastructure, deficiencies in equipment and medication, and a shortage of well-prepared rehabilitation workforce. CONCLUSIONS: Based on WHO recommendations "Rehabilitation in health systems", this study provides suggestions on how to strengthen rehabilitation services in Mongolia to better respond to the needs of the SCI population. Our findings highlight that a core issue is the lack of awareness among policymakers regarding rehabilitation and its benefits at the micro, meso and macro levels of the health system. Actions are needed at the level of health policies to ensure, for instance, adequate financing and access to the services. Also, synergies between the Ministries of Education and Health can improve the training of the workforce.Implications for rehabilitationEvidence that rehabilitation services contribute to improving health outcomes and cost-effectiveness could raise awareness among Mongolian policymakers and inform their decisions on funding schemes.Health policies in Mongolia should be reformed to remove barriers in the provision of rehabilitation services for persons with complex and chronic health conditions. Rehabilitation services need to be included into the Mongolian health insurance scheme in order to improve the quality and accessibility of rehabilitation services.Synergies between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health in Mongolia are needed to develop training standards for rehabilitation professionals.

AB  - This study explored associations between quality of life (QOL), spirituality, social integration, chronic diseases, and lifetime adversity among people aged 60 years and older in Bhutan. Adults aged 60 to 101 years (n = 337) completed face-to-face interviews. The main measure included the World Health Organization QOL questionnaire and Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire. The social relationships domain of QOL had the highest mean. Frequent back pain, memory decline, depression, mobility impairment, insomnia, and lung diseases were commonly reported and negatively related to QOL. Compared with women, men reported fewer physical and mental health problems and better QOL. Multivariate analysis revealed that cumulative health problems, psychological distress, and social connectedness contributed significantly to overall QOL. The measure of spirituality was negatively associated with QOL, which is not conclusive and suggests the need for more research especially when the influence of spiritualism is highly visible in the everyday lives of Bhutanese people. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to care for elderly people in Bhutan.

AB  - Chronic lower back pain (CLBP) is a common problem in older adults and is a cause of significant disability in this population. Multiple treatment modalities exist for the treatment of CLBP but there is not one definitive intervention that has proven superiority over all other interventions. Spinal stenosis is a common complication of CLBP in older adults and although it is commonly diagnosed there are questions as to whether it is the principal pathology. This grand rounds presentation explores the management of chronic lower back pain in an older adult. The management strategies are presented from the perspectives of a chiropractor, a physiatrist, a geriatrician and a nurse. The management strategies presented will exemplify the varied approaches but is designed to give the clinician a broader view of the management of CLBP in older adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To obtain an insider's view about disability-related pain to help rehabilitation clinicians understand the experience and to show how people with disability manage daily living and encounters with other people. DESIGN: Qualitative methods by using open-ended interviews and thematic analysis. SETTING: Rehabilitation research program. PARTICIPANTS: Nine adults with chronic physical disability and pain were recruited from study groups. The 9 included people with spinal cord injury, acquired amputation, or cerebral palsy. INTERVENTION: Interview protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Phenomenologic analysis of interviews based on codewords derived from interview topics and themes. RESULTS: Study participants described pain as a part of daily living that influenced many lifestyle decisions. They characterized pain as plural, meaning that it has multiple locations, distinctive descriptions, and different implications. They also were concerned about pain being a mystery, having unclear causes and consequences. Typically they described pain as a personal venture, with little or dissatisfying communication about pain with family, friends, or health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding pain associated with physical disability can help guide rehabilitation practitioners in their pain assessments, interventions, and related research. Our findings suggest that some people with disability-related pain may benefit from reassurance and specific planning for expected and unexpected pain episodes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify common pain descriptors used by people with physical disability-related pain and to suggest words that are likely to prompt responses in clinical interviews and assessments. DESIGN: Open-ended interviews were coded and then contrasted with responses to a pain questionnaire, obtained through mail or interview surveys. SETTING: Rehabilitation research program. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight people with physical disability-related pain in a series (n=54) of in-depth interviews and 1053 participants with disabilities who responded to mailed questionnaires or structured interviews about pain and its impact (459 with acquired lower-limb amputation, 471 with spinal cord injury, 123 with cerebral palsy). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain interview descriptions and McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). RESULTS: Different pain experiences were reflected in narrative descriptions and self-report questionnaire responses. We report the common terms, but across diagnoses use of terms does not appear to clearly differentiate distinct pain phenomenon. Narrative interviews support the use of several MPQ pain descriptors. However, discrete descriptors are recommended when assessing adults with physical disability. CONCLUSIONS: We identified pain descriptors that appear to be most useful in assessing daily life and participation experiences with physical disability-related pain. These may be clinically useful, but caution is advised when doing diagnostic workups based solely on sensory and affective pain descriptions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With physical disabilities, persons often experience secondary pain that adds to restrictions in activity and participation. We investigated pain-management strategies used by those with physical disabilities. METHOD: Qualitative phenomenological inquiry was used in multiple interviews with (N= 28) adults with physical disabilities (9 with amputation, 7 with cerebral palsy, and 12 with spinal cord injury) and subsequent thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among those with physical disabilities, a distinction is made between usual and unexpected pains. Usual pain is experienced consistently or as a consequence of not getting adequate rest, exercise, or stress-free time. Managing usual pain involves uses of prevention (e.g., exercise/fitness) and/or pragmatic actions through scheduling and pacing daily activities and taking interim retreats. Unexpected pain is experienced periodically and requires an immediate response and change of activity. To manage, persons describe making efforts to create a mind and body disassociation, activating safety nets to support function and alleviate pain, and making decisions to persevere with activity and participation. CONCLUSION: Advising those with physical disabilities to do proactive planning for both usual and unexpected pain may help them to use varied pain-management strategies to enhance function and minimize negative impacts on participation.

AB  - Purpose: Participatory ergonomics engages workers in the development of strategies to reduce workplace-related pain, offering a flexible and practical option to create individualized context-specific strategies. This paper describes the outcomes of a feasibility study using a participatory approach for self-management of low back pain in clam farmers. Methods: A within-subject time-control design with repeated baseline and post-intervention assessment was used. After refining individual and team-based strategies, stakeholder interviews, and rapid prototyping, workers selected three strategies to use for 8 weeks. Frequency and ease of use for strategies are described. Pre-post paired t-tests were used for analysis of pain-related disability, difficulty and pain with work tasks, pain-related fear, self-efficacy, and coping. Analysis of improvements exceeding published and individual variability was calculated. Results: Participants chose both team and individual strategies, most using strategies 5 days a week >50% of the time. Significant improvements in pain-related disability, pain during specific tasks, pain-related anxiety, and coping were seen after 8 weeks of implementing strategies. No changes in task difficulty, fear, self-efficacy and average resting pain were reported. Pain improvements > MDC95 were reported by 74% with 56–64% > personalized MDC95 for lifting tasks. Conclusions: Pain-related disability, work activity pain ratings and related pain anxiety and coping improved beyond individual variability in this feasibility study. Multiple strategies allowed workers to choose relevant self-management options. Introduction of work-related changes in the workplace, visual demonstration, review of team videos and reminders were helpful. Further studies of this approach are needed.

AB  - Background. There is much evidence that place and sense of place have an effect on our health and well-being. HIV/AIDS is a prime example of the type of event that can alter the relationship of self to place. The social fallout (stigma, prejudice) of this disease can (dis)place an individual but can also turn into a call to action to (re)claim place. This dissertation is about unearthing the phenomenon of place in relation to a rural woman living with HIV.Statement of the problem. The concept of place; whether it be a sense of belonging, emotional attachment, or the interaction between humans and places; has prodigious effects on the human organism. Place may be a barometer of balance in the ecology of women's lives. And yet, it is extremely difficult to pin down the elements of place. Making the connection between place, health, and well-being is the aim of this dissertation.Methodology. Using qualitative secondary analysis, a longitudinal case study of a rural woman living with HIV was conducted to discover and describe place narratives, stories, and patterns of meaning from previously collected data.Findings. Veronica's relationship with her rural landscape had two competing forces; one was refuge and the other was exclusion. She experienced place as exclusion when people learned of her HIV status and built fences to shut her out. The farm where Veronica lived was her refuge. There, she could get away from people and do what she loved most in the world, which was to work. Veronica's sense of place and personal identity were strongly tied to work ethic and productivity. But, Veronica sustained a job injury that left her with chronic debilitating back pain. This threatened her ability to live in her place as she was accustomed. The over-arching substantive conclusion of Veronica's story is that place became, simultaneously, exclusion and refuge. Veronica's sense of place was about work, and this was threatened. Yet, it was her relationship to place that instilled in her an inner rural idyll that gave her hope and longing for the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a highly prevalent condition with no definitive treatment. Professional Kinesiology Practice (PKP) is a little known complementary medicine technique using non-standard muscle testing; no previous effectiveness studies have been performed. METHODS: This is an exploratory, pragmatic single-blind, 3-arm randomised sham-controlled pilot study with waiting list control (WLC) in private practice UK (2007-2009). 70 participants scoring >=4 on the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) were randomised to real or sham PKP receiving 1 treatment weekly for 5 weeks or a WLC. WLC's were re-randomised to real or sham after 6 weeks. The main outcome was a change in RMDQ from baseline to end of 5 weeks of real or sham PKP. RESULTS: With an effect size of 0.7 real treatment was significantly different to sham (mean difference RMDQ score = -2.9, p = 0.04, 95% CI -5.8 to -0.1). Compared to WLC, real and sham groups had significant RMDQ improvements (real -9.0, p < 0.01, 95% CI -12.1 to -5.8; effect size 2.1; sham -6.1, p < 0.01, 95% CI -9.1 to -3.1; effect size 1.4). Practitioner empathy (CARE) and patient enablement (PEI) did not predict outcome; holistic health beliefs (CAMBI) did, though. The sham treatment appeared credible; patients did not guess treatment allocation. 3 patients reported minor adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: Real treatment was significantly different from sham demonstrating a moderate specific effect of PKP; both were better than WLC indicating a substantial non-specific and contextual treatment effect. A larger definitive study would be appropriate with nested qualitative work to help understand the mechanisms involved in PKP.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors employ a Whole Systems framework to explore implementation of new guidelines for back and neck pain in Oregon's Medicaid system. Whole Systems research is useful for understanding the relationship between complementary and integrative health care (CIH) and conventional health care systems in real-world clinical and practice settings. DESIGN: Preliminary results are from an observational study designed to evaluate state-wide implementation of CIH and other non-pharmacological treatments for neck and back pain among Oregon Medicaid patients. This natural experiment, even in early stages, provides insight into the challenges of integrating Whole Systems oriented therapies into Medicaid billing and treatment. METHODS: Qualitative data are drawn from: (1) semi-structured interviews with representatives of each of the 16 coordinated care organizations (CCOs) responsible for administering the Oregon's Medicaid insurance through the Oregon Health Plan (OHP); and (2) open-ended survey responses from acupuncturists in all 16 CCO areas. RESULTS: Implementation of the new policy guidelines poses logistical and epistemological challenges. Differences in worldview, inadequate reimbursement, and simple lack of awareness of CIH among medical providers are some of the factors that pose barriers to merging CIH therapies into conventional frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: In this article, we explore the potential for a Whole Systems perspective to better explain the complexity of integrating CIH and other non-pharmacological services into a state financed health care system. Oregon's expansion of services for back and neck pain presents an opportunity to explore challenges and successes in melding multiple approaches to health and pain management into a managed system such as the OHP.

AB  - A handful of recent studies have documented perceived discrimination as a correlate of poor physical and mental health status among ethnic and racial minority groups. To date, however, despite a proliferation of research on ethnic disparities in the severity and impact of a number of persistent pain conditions, there have been no reports on associations between perceived discriminationand pain-related symptoms. Using data from a national survey (the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States; MIDUS), we explore the relationships between perceived discriminatory events and the report of back pain among African-American and white men and women. As expected, African-American participants reported substantially greater perceptions of discriminationthan white participants. Moreover, in models that included a variety of physical and mental health variables, episodes of major lifetime discriminatory events were the strongest predictors of back pain report in African-Americans, and perceived day-to-day discrimination was the strongest predictor of back pain report specifically in African-American women. Among white participants, perceptions of discrimination were minimally related or unrelated to back pain. To our knowledge, these are the first data documenting an association between perceived discrimination and report of back pain; the fact that perceptions of discrimination were stronger predictors than physical health variables highlights the potential salience and adverse impact of perceived discrimination in ethnic and racialminority groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Men with chronic prostatitis are frequently seen in urological practice and are difficult to treat with standard antimicrobial medications. This pilot study was designed to take a different perspective in assessing chronic prostatitis patients with pain by evaluating them using a standard chronic pain clinic psychological approach. DESIGN: Twenty men, 27% of the referred group of patients with chronic prostatitis and pain, completed the MMPI and a structured psychological interview. Their findings were compared to age- and education-matched men seeking treatment for chronic low back pain. SETTING: Data were collected at the Pain Clinic within the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Washington Medical Center. PATIENTS: Patients were 20 men referred from a urology-based Prostatitis Clinic and 20 men referred to the Pain Clinic for chronic low back pain. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The two groups differed in the impact of their pain problem on their lives. Prostatitis patients were employed but reported that their symptoms greatly interfered with their sexual/romantic relationships. Back pain patients reported that their pain interfered primarily with work; most of these patients had long-term marital relationships, whereas few prostatitis patients did. Half of the prostatitis patients met criteria for major depression, but back pain patients were more somatically focused, depressed, and anxious. The constellation of relationship problems, disruptions in sexual functioning, levels of depression, along with failure of multiple previous medical treatments in men with chronic prostatitis indicates that continued antimicrobial therapy is unlikely to provide the "cure" these patients seek. Psychological evaluation, couples' counseling, individual counseling, and medications for depression all may play a role in a comprehensive approach to these patients. These results must be considered as preliminary and as representative of a possibly skewed sample of prostatitis patients since only those men who accepted the referral to a pain clinic psychologist for an evaluation were assessed. Clearly, they are likely to be among the patients who are most psychologically and sexually impaired by the chronic prostatitis and associated pain. A further study with less self-selection is indicated.

AB  - Background: The literature supports the effectiveness of self-management support (SMS) to improve health outcomes of patients with chronic spine pain. However, patient engagement in SMS programs is suboptimal. The objectives of this study were to: 1) assess participation in self-care (i.e. activation) among patients with spine pain, 2) identify patients' barriers and enablers to using SMS, and 3) map behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to key barriers to inform the design of a knowledge translation (KT) intervention aimed to increase the use of SMS. Methods: In summer 2016, we invited 250 patients with spine pain seeking care at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College in Ontario, Canada to complete the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) survey to assess the level of participation in self-care. We subsequently conducted individual interviews, in summer 2017, based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) in a subset of patients to identify potential challenges to using SMS. The interview guide included 20 open-ended questions and accompanying probes. Findings were deductively analysed guided by the TDF. A panel of 7 experts mapped key barriers to BCTs, designed a KT intervention, and selected the modes of delivery. Results: Two hundred and twenty-three patients completed the PAM. Approximately 24% of respondents were not actively involved in their care. Interview findings from 13 spine pain patients suggested that the potential barriers to using SMS corresponded to four TDF domains: Environmental Context and Resources; Emotion; Memory, Attention & Decision-Making; and Behavioural Regulation. The proposed theory-based KT intervention includes paper-based educational materials, webinars and videos, summarising and demonstrating the therapeutic recommendations including exercises and other lifestyle changes. In addition, the KT intervention includes Brief Action Planning, a SMS strategy based on motivational interviewing, along with a SMART plan and reminders. Conclusions: Almost one quarter of study participants were not actively engaged in their spine care. Key barriers likely to influence uptake of SMS among patients were identified and used to inform the design of a theory-based KT intervention to increase their participation level. The proposed multi-component KT intervention may be an effective strategy to optimize the quality of spine pain care and improve patients' health-outcomes.

Outcome was assessed from reported experience of pain, global change and working status at follow up. Results: The frequency of personality disorders was 16%. Patients with a 'Dramatic' personality disorder had more pain at follow up. Conclusions: The results indicate that the presence of a personality disorder might result in a worse long-term outcome after surgery for low back pain.

AB  - Health anxiety disorders (e.g., hypochondriasis) are prevalent but understudied in older adults. Existing research suggests that severe health anxiety has a late age of onset, perhaps because of comorbidity with physical health conditions that are more likely to occur with aging. Despite being under diagnosed in later life due to a lack of age-appropriate diagnostic criteria, significant positive associations with age suggest that health anxiety disorders are more prevalent in older than younger adults. Preliminary research also highlights the complexity of these disorders in older adults and the potential importance of medical morbidity as a risk factor. This review explores the complexities of health anxiety disorders in later life with a focus on understanding defining features, prevalence rates, correlates, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. We offer a theoretical model of the development of severe health anxiety among older adults to encourage further research on this important and under-studied topic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines for persistent low back pain (LBP) do not recommend the injection of therapeutic substances into the back as a treatment for LBP because of the absence of evidence for their effectiveness. This feasibility study aimed to provide a stable platform that could be used to evaluate a randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of intra-articular facet joint injections (FJIs) when added to normal care. OBJECTIVES: To explore the feasibility of running a RCT to test the hypothesis that, for people with suspected facet joint back pain, adding the option of intra-articular FJIs (local anaesthetic and corticosteroids) to best usual non-invasive care is clinically effective and cost-effective. DESIGN: The trial was a mixed design. The RCT pilot protocol development involved literature reviews and a consensus conference followed by a randomised pilot study with an embedded mixed-methods process evaluation. SETTING: Five NHS acute trusts in England. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients aged >= 18 years with moderately troublesome LBP present (> 6 months), who had failed previous conservative treatment and who had suspected facet joint pain. The study aimed to recruit 150 participants (approximately 30 per site). Participants were randomised sequentially by a remote service to FJIs combined with 'best usual care' (BUC) or BUC alone. INTERVENTIONS: All participants were to receive six sessions of a bespoke BUC rehabilitation package. Those randomised into the intervention arm were, in addition, given FJIs with local anaesthetic and steroids (at up to six injection sites). Randomisation occurred at the end of the first BUC session. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Process and clinical outcomes. Clinical outcomes included a measurement of level of pain on a scale from 0 to 10, which was collected daily and then weekly via text messaging (or through a written diary). Questionnaire follow-up was at 3 months. RESULTS: Fifty-two stakeholders attended the consensus meeting. Agreement informed several statistical questions and three design considerations: diagnosis, the process of FJI and the BUC package and informing the design for the randomised pilot study. Recruitment started on 26 June 2015 and was terminated by the funder (as a result of poor recruitment) on 11 December 2015. In total, 26 participants were randomised. Process data illuminate some of the reasons for recruitment problems but also show that trial processes after enrolment ran smoothly. No between-group analysis was carried out. All pain-related outcomes show the expected improvement between baseline and follow-up. The mean total cost of the overall treatment package (injection 419.22 and BUC 264.00) was estimated at 683.22 per participant. This is similar to a NHS tariff cost for a course of FJIs of 686.84. LIMITATIONS: Poor recruitment was a limiting factor. CONCLUSIONS: This feasibility study achieved consensus on the main challenges in a trial of FJIs for people with persistent non-specific low back pain. FUTURE WORK: Further work is needed to test recruitment from alternative clinical situations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2014-000682-50 and Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN93184143. FUNDING: This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 21, No. 30.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence from a number of primary care centres suggests that integration of chiropractic services into chronic pain management is associated with improved clinical outcomes and high patient satisfaction as well as with reductions in physician visits, specialist referrals use of advanced imaging and prescribing of analgesics. However, formal assessments of the integration of chiropractic services into primary care settings are sparse, and the impact of such integration on prescription opioid use in chronic pain management remains uncertain. To help address this knowledge gap, we will conduct a mixed methods health service evaluation of an integrated chiropractic back pain programme in an urban community health centre in Ontario, Canada. This centre provides services to vulnerable populations with high unemployment rates, multiple comorbidities and musculoskeletal disorders that are commonly managed with prescription opioids. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a sequential explanatory mixed methods design, which consists of a quantitative phase followed by a qualitative phase. In the quantitative phase, we will conduct a retrospective chart review and evaluate whether receipt of chiropractic services is associated with reduced opioid use among patients already prescribed opioid therapy for chronic pain. We will measure opioid prescriptions (ie, opioid fills, number of refills and dosages) by reviewing electronic medical records of recipients and non-recipients of chiropractic services between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2020 and use multivariable regression analysis to examine the association. In the qualitative phase, we will conduct in-depth, one-on-one interviews of patients and their general practitioners to explore perceptions of chiropractic integration and its impact on opioid use. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board at McMaster University (approval number 2021-10930). The results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and in-person or webinar presentations to community members and healthcare professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While many different types of patient education are widely used, the effect of individual patient education for low-back pain (LBP) has not yet been systematically reviewed. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether individual patient education is effective in the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and which type is most effective. SEARCH STRATEGY: A computerized literature search of MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1988 to July 2006), CINAHL (1982 to July 2006), PsycINFO (1984 to July 2006), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 2) was performed. References cited in the identified articles were screened. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies were selected if the design was a randomised controlled trial; if patients experienced LBP; if the type of intervention concerned individual patient education, and if the publication was written in English, German, or Dutch. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The methodological quality was independently assessed by two review authors. Articles that met at least 50% of the quality criteria were considered high quality. Main outcome measures were pain intensity, global measure of improvement, back pain-specific functional status, return-to-work, and generic functional status. Analysis comprised a qualitative analysis. Evidence was classified as strong, moderate, limited, conflicting or no evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 24 studies included in this review, 14 (58%) were of high quality. Individual patient education was compared with no intervention in 12 studies; with non-educational interventions in 11 studies; and with other individual educational interventions in eight studies. Results showed that for patients with subacute LBP, there is strong evidence that an individual 2.5 hour oral educational session is more effective on short-term and long-term return-to-work than no intervention. Educational interventions that were less intensive were not more effective than no intervention. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that individual education for patients with (sub)acute LBP is as effective as non-educational interventions on long-term pain and global improvement and that for chronic patients, individual education is less effective for back pain-specific function when compared to more intensive interventions. Comparison of different types of individual education did not show significant differences. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For patients with acute or subacute LBP, intensive patient education seems to be effective. For patients with chronic LBP, the effectiveness of individual education is still unclear. [References: 62]

AB  - To determine the differences between clinical effects of electroacupuncture and biofeedback therapy in addition to conventional treatment in patients with cervical myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). Randomized clinical trial. Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic of a university hospital. Fifty patients (N=50) aged 25-55 years of both sexes with chronic neck pain diagnosed with MPS (characterized by trigger points within taut bands) were randomly assigned to 2 equal groups of 25 individuals. The patients in electroacupuncture group were treated with standard acupuncture and concomitant electrical stimulation; those in biofeedback group received visual electromyography biofeedback therapy for muscle activity and relaxation. Both groups received the intervention 2 times a week for a total of 6 sessions. Basic exercise training and medicines were administered for all the patients. Pain severity based on the visual analog scale (VAS), functional status using Neck Disability Index (NDI), cervical range of motion (ROM) using and inclinometer, and pressure pain threshold (PPT) using an algometer were evaluated before and at 3 and 12 weeks after the treatment. Primary outcome was defined as 20% reduction in the 3-month neck pain and dysfunction compared to baseline, assessed through the NDI. Fifty patients (39 women, 11 men) with a mean age (years) ± SD of 39.0±5.5 and neck pain duration (weeks) of 6.0±2.2 were analyzed. All parameters, except for PPT of the lower trapezius and paravertebral muscles were improved significantly in both groups, while baseline values were controlled. The primary outcome was achieved more significantly in the acupuncture group than in the biofeedback group: 20 (80.0%) vs 10 (40.0%); rate ratio=2 with 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-3.36; number needed to treat (NNT)=2.5 with 95% CI, 1.54-6.58. Advantages of acupuncture over biofeedback were observed according to values obtained from the NDI, VAS, extension and left lateral-bending ROM, and PPT on the left upper trapezius after the last session of intervention until 3 months (P <.05). Both electroacupuncture and biofeedback therapies were found to be effective in management of MPS when integrated with conventional treatment. However, intergroup differences showed priority of acupuncture in some parameters vs biofeedback. Thus, electroacupuncture seems to be a better complementary modality for treatment of MPS in the neck and upper back area.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In October 2017, a partnership was established between the University Hospital of Toulouse and the French Chiropractic College, "Institut Franco-Europeen de Chiropraxie" (IFEC). Before 2017, chiropractors did not practice in hospitals in France. Chiropractic students and chiropractors are now integrated in an interdisciplinary medical team at University Hospital. Our study aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who received chiropractic care at the University Hospital of Toulouse, their expectations, experiences of care, and satisfaction. METHOD: A prospective case study was conducted. Patients referred for chiropractic care in the French University Hospital of Toulouse from January to December 2020 were eligible to participate. Participants provided the following data: demographics, previous chiropractic care treatments, pain location, intensity (NRS) and duration, disability (NDI, ODI), health-related quality of life (SF-12) and depressive symptomatology (PHQ-9). We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore their expectations, barriers and facilitators impacting their experience of care, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Seventeen participants were recruited and seven were interviewed. All participants had chronic pain with a median pain intensity of 05/10 (IQR 04-06) on the NRS scale. Nine of 17 participants presented with multiple pain locations. Thirteen of seventeen participants presented with low back pain and eight with neck pain. The median SF-12 health-related quality of life score was 50/100 (IQR 28.5-60.5) for physical health, and 52/100 (IQR 43-62) for mental health. The PHQ-9 median score of depressive symptomatology was 7.7/27 (IQR 2.0-12.5). Overall, participants were satisfied with their care and the collaboration between chiropractors and physicians. Participants expected a caring communication with the chiropractic team. Their experience was facilitated by their trust in their physician. Patients perceived the turnover of chiropractic students as a barrier to their satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Our participants presented with chronic musculoskeletal pain and depressive symptoms. Our study identified facilitators and barriers for patient expectation and satisfaction with chiropractic care in a hospital setting. This study provides the first data describing the collaboration between chiropractors and physicians in France in the management of musculoskeletal disorders. These findings will inform the quality improvement of our partnership, student's training and the development of future hospital-based collaborations integrating chiropractic care in a multidisciplinary team in France.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic rheumatic disease often seek relief in unconventional treatments, but many of them do not share this information with their physician. OBJECTIVE: To explore which conventional and unconventional interventions are used by patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Which of these do they continue to use and which do they give up? PATIENTS: One-hundred fifty patients (36 female, 114 male) with ankylosing spondylitis, who presented for radon thermal treatment at the Gasteiner Heilstollen Hospital (mean age 50 +/- 11 years; disease duration 24 +/- 11 years). METHOD: A previous investigation identified 75 interventions used by patients with AS to influence their disease. In a face-to-face, structured interview all these interventions (terms used by the patients) were now presented to 150 other patients with AS. They were asked to state whether they had already used (and given up) the respective intervention or whether they intend to continue using it and intend to use it in future. RESULTS: A summary of all interventions previously and still used by patients showed conventional interventions (67%) to out-number unconventional (33%) interventions. Of the 150 patients, 20 stated that they use or have used more than 15 different unconventional interventions. In addition to health resort medicine (interview at a health resort!), massage therapy, physiotherapy and physical exercise were the most commonly used of the conventional interventions. Of the unconventional interventions warm climate, sea bathing, self-applied psychotherapy, vitamin pills, repression, showering with alternating cold and warm water, and self-help groups were named most frequently. CONCLUSION: Some patients with ankylosing spondylitis use many different (33% unconventional) interventions. In the patient's view, even rather general interventions such as warm climate or sea bathing are regarded as relevant to the disease. An open doctor-patient discussion of unconventional interventions used by the patient appears reasonable. The results confirm that most patients suffering from chronic and incurable disease seek relief in unconventional therapies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease in which individuals experience a long delay to diagnosis. Prior to diagnosis, individuals report frequent use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. While popularly used, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the experiences of CAM practitioners in terms of treating individuals with AS. Addressing this knowledge gap, the present study provides a detailed exploration of how UK-based CAM practitioners treat individuals with AS. METHODS: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with eight UK-based CAM practitioners, (four males), aged 45-69 years. CAM practitioners were recruited across a range of CAM therapies and years of CAM practice experience (8-46 years). RESULTS: Thematic analysis resulted in the identification of three themes to characterize the data. Themes comprised: (i) the whole picture; (ii) alarm bells; and (iii) a common language. Themes highlighted CAM practitioner adoption of a holistic, yet individualized approach to treating individuals with AS, despite a general sense of lack of knowledge concerning AS among CAM practitioners. Notably, results indicated a desire of CAM practitioners to work more collaboratively with mainstream health providers to provide more joined-up care for individuals with AS. CONCLUSION: CAM practitioners emphasized the benefits of CAM to focus on providing effective symptom management when used in conjunction, rather than in opposition to, mainstream healthcare. Adoption of a more holistic approach to AS management by CAM practitioners may empower clients to become more aware of symptoms, thus potentially reducing delays in receiving a formal diagnosis of AS.

AB  - Background: Staphylococcus caprae (Sc) is an uncommon causative organism for human. Lumbar pyogenic spondylodiscitis (LPS) of Sc is extremely rare and only a few cases have been reported. As far as we know, there is no specific literature on the diagnosis and treatment for LPS of Sc with L5 nerve root irritation.Case Presentation: A 65-year-old male patient complained of chronic low back pain for 10 years, acute worsening with radiating pain to left lower extremity over a month. Physical examination revealed tenderness point on his low back, 3/5 dorsiflexor strength in his left 1st toe and decreased sensation of pin prick over the left lateral shank and medial dorsal foot. The individual was initially misdiagnosed with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) without further examination in outpatient, which was then found to be LPS of Sc with L5 nerve root irritation after admission to our hospital. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) of lumbar spine exhibited inflammation signal at L4-L5 level of the vertebral body and disc with hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1-WI) and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (T2-WI). The causative organism was confirmed by the culture of irrigation fluid obtained from L5 vertebrae by needle puncture. After systemic conservative treatment including using sensitive antimicrobial agents and immobilization, the rare infection was finally cured. The patient also showed a satisfactory recovery during the 36-month follow-up period.Conclusions: Confirming the diagnosis and identifying the causative organism as soon as possible is the key point for the treatment of LPS. LPS of Sc causing nerve root irritation is rare but curable with early diagnosis and proper therapy. The culture of irrigation fluid obtained from vertebrae by needle puncture may be an effective and sensitive attempt for potential infection of spine to identify the causative organism at early stage of the disease.

AB  - Objective  Standard-of-care for opioid use disorder (OUD) includes medication and counseling. However, there is an unmet need for complementary approaches to treat OUD patients coping with pain; furthermore, few studies have probed neurobiological features of pain or its management during OUD treatment. This preliminary study examines neurobiological and behavioral effects of a virtual reality-based meditative intervention in patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).  Design  Prospective, non-blinded, single-arm, 12-week intervention with standardized assessments.  Setting  Academic research laboratory affiliated with an on-site MMT clinic.  Methods  Fifteen (11 female) MMT patients completed a virtual reality, therapist-guided meditative intervention that included breathing and relaxation exercises; sessions were scheduled twice weekly. Assessments included functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of pain neuromatrix activation and connectivity (pre- and post-intervention), saliva cortisol and C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12; and self-reported pain and affective symptoms before and after each intervention session.  Results  After each intervention session (relative to pre-session), ratings of pain, opioid craving, anxiety and depression (but not anger) decreased. Saliva cortisol (but not CRP) levels decreased from pre- to post-session. From pre- to post-intervention fMRI assessments, pain task-related left postcentral gyrus (PCG) activation decreased. At baseline, PCG showed positive connectivity with other regions of the pain neuromatrix, but this pattern changed post-intervention.  Conclusions  These preliminary findings demonstrate feasibility, therapeutic promise, and brain basis of a meditative intervention for OUD patients undergoing MMT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: the objectives of the study are to develop a patient-oriented and theory-based questionnaire on the communication preferences of chronically ill patients (KOPRA questionnaire) and to carry out psychometric testing of the instrument. METHODS: following two preliminary studies (focus groups, cognitive interviews), a total of 472 patients with chronic back pain or chronic ischemic heart disease were surveyed. In the main sample (N=333), communication preferences regarding the physician were assessed; for N=89 (or N=50) patients, preferences regarding nursing staff (or therapists) were analyzed. Psychometric testing was done with respect to unidimensionality, fit to an item response theory (IRT) model, and for reliability. The questionnaire was developed and validated in German. RESULTS: In the physician version with a total of 32 items, there are four scales ("Patient participation and patient orientation", "Effective and open communication", "Emotionally supportive communication", and "Communication about personal circumstances") that are unidimensional, fulfill the demands for a 1-parameter IRT model, and are reliable (Cronbach's alpha between .80 and .92). The psychometric properties with respect to nursing staff and therapists are slightly worse. CONCLUSION: the KOPRA questionnaire has good psychometric properties. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: clinical use of the questionnaire appears useful to determine patients' communication preferences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to design and psychometrically test a patient questionnaire to capture patient communication competence in the context of patient-provider interaction (CoCo questionnaire). We also aimed to determine patient characteristics associated with competent patient behavior. METHODS: To assure content validity, we initially conducted 17 focus groups (n=97) made up of patients and providers. In the main study n=1.264 patients with chronic back pain, chronic-ischemic heart disease or breast cancer who underwent inpatient rehabilitation were surveyed at the end of rehabilitation. RESULTS: The CoCo questionnaire contains four scales (patient adherence in communication, critical and participative communication, communication about personal circumstances, active disease-related communication) and 28 items addressing competent patient behavior. We provide evidence of unidimensionality, local independence, reliability, a Rasch-Model fit, the absence of differential item functioning, and signs of construct validity. The most important correlates of communication competence are health literacy and communication self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The CoCo questionnaire has good psychometric properties in German. Future research should examine CoCo's responsiveness and analyze criterion validity by means of observation data. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The CoCo questionnaire can be recommended for use in evaluating patient communication training programs.

AB  - Low back pain is a common and costly social problem. Many of the long term outcomes of chronic low back pain (CLBP), such as those related to occupational and social function or patient and family coping, are sensitive to nursing intervention. To identify potentially productive areas for nursing intervention research, studies from 1990 to 1998 were reviewed that investigated (a) potential early indicators that acute or subchronic low back pain would result in chronic pain and disability, (b) patient perspectives on adaptation to chronic pain, and (c) the value of interventions undertaken during the acute and subchronic phases of back pain to modify long-term outcomes. Sixteen quantitative studies were identified that prospectively investigated the natural history and outcomes of low back pain. Six qualitative studies that investigated the perspectives of patients with back pain were also identified. Ten randomized clinical trials were identified that investigated interventions undertaken during the acute or subchronic stages of back pain. Clinical interventions that included advice to re-engage in activity, support to develop personalized goals, reinforcement for healthy gains and appropriate functional activities, and physical conditioning exercises tended to be successful in returning patients to work or limiting their self-reported disability and pain. Interventions that promoted communication at the work-site or modified the patient's job were also successful in promoting a faster return to work. Nonetheless, this is a nascent area of research in need of improvements related to the selection of appropriate subjects and controls, the timing and duration of interventions, and the reliability with which interventions are implemented. Furthermore, patients with back pain are most likely to benefit when nursing theories about chronic pain are linked to clinical intervention research. [References: 102]

AB  - STUDY RATIONALE: Low back pain is a common condition and one of the leading reasons for years of chronic disability. Rehabilitation has been shown to be effective on low back pain, because it is based on the complex and multifactorial mechanisms that low back pain entails. AIM: The aim of this study was to describe and interpret rehabilitation team members' experiences and perspectives regarding an integrated rehabilitation program for patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This qualitative study used the Interpretive Description methodology. Data consisted of participant observation of 28 rehabilitation team members and four semi-structured focus group interviews with 20 of the 28 participants. The COREQ checklist was used to consolidate the findings in the study. RESULTS: The results represented an insight into rehabilitation team members' experiences and perspectives regarding the implementation of an integrated rehabilitation program for patients with chronic low back pain. The significance of the rehabilitation team members' expectations was underlined as they initially had positive expectations but along the implementing of the program found their expectations challenged. The challenges they experienced were related to their professional competence, the incongruity of the two programs being compared, and to their utilization of quick fixes. CONCLUSION: This Interpretive Description study provides insight into the complexity and challenges related to implementation practice. It identifies important elements when implementing a new rehabilitation intervention in clinical practice and emphasizes the importance of expectations among rehabilitation team members in the implementation process. There should be a specific focus on the importance of involving rehabilitation team members when new interventions are to be implemented, as participation contributes to increased positivity in relation to new initiatives.

AB  - Mindfulness has been applied in several adaptations, including Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, to treat chronic conditions in older adults. Older adults may be particularly well suited for mindfulness interventions, because they bring decades of life experience to this contemplative therapy. Mindfulness is also an appealing intervention for older adults as it is inexpensive, effective over time, and easy to access. This article examines mental and physical chronic conditions proven responsive to mindfulness, including cognitive function, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, loneliness, posttraumatic stress disorder, cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson\u0027s disease, urge urinary incontinence, and chronic pain.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this qualitative study is to investigate, from patient's perspective, the aspects of the relationship between low back pain and sexual life on physical, psychological and social aspects of individual's life. In addition, this study aims to explore patients' opinions on the role of health care providers in addressing and treating low back pain-related sexual problems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 outpatients referred to physical therapy for subacute or chronic non-specific low back pain; the questions investigated the presence of sexual disability and aspects related to patient's behaviour. Two independent physical therapists, supervised by a third expert physical therapist and a clinical psychologist proficient in qualitative methodology, performed thematic content analysis to identify categories and themes. RESULTS: Patients with low back pain consider sexual disability severely limiting and correlated to pain. This study emphasized the perception of invalidity, the importance of the relationship with the partner, the emotions and gender roles in the couple, and the relevance for health care providers to take part in the clinical management. The physical therapist is believed to be a qualified figure to address this issue and specific suggestions on sexual activity could be useful. CONCLUSION: Sexual disability in patients with subacute or chronic LBP acquires an important and individual meaning that can be investigated within the therapeutic context, especially by physical therapists. Implications for Rehabilitation Sexual disability related to low back pain is considered an important and meaningful topic from the patient's perspective. This reflects the importance of the emotional relationship with the partner.Within the therapeutic context, it is important to provide information to help manage pain during sexual activity. The physical therapist is seen to be a qualified figure to address this issue.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the smallest worthwhile effects of two treatments for nonspecific low back pain (LBP). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The benefit-harm trade-off method was used to estimate the smallest worthwhile effect of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physiotherapy for LBP. Patients seeking care for chronic LBP were interviewed by telephone before treatment commenced and 4 weeks later. RESULTS: Patients need to see a median of 30% (interquartile range [IQR]: 10-40) more improvement in pain and 20% (IQR: 10-40) more improvement in disability than would occur without intervention to perceive the effect of NSAIDs are worthwhile. They would need to see 20% (IQR: 0-30) more improvement on pain and disability over natural recovery to perceive that the effect of physiotherapy was worthwhile. There was no difference in estimates of the smallest worthwhile effect elicited at baseline and 4 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: People with chronic back pain need to see larger effects on pain of NSAIDS than physiotherapy to consider the effects of these interventions worthwhile. These estimates of the smallest worthwhile effect can be used to interpret the findings of clinical trials and to design adequately powered clinical trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic pain is a multidimensional experience that is influenced by biological, psychological, social, and spiritual factors. The Meaning Making Model is a recent cognitive behavioral model that has been developed to understand how psychosocial factors influence adjustment to stressful events, such as having a chronic illness. This qualitative study aims to understand the potential utility of this model for understanding the role of meaning making in adjustment to chronic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen community-dwelling adults with chronic low back pain or chronic pain due to osteoarthritis participated in four focus groups. Participants were asked open-ended questions about their pain experience, pain-related beliefs, meaning of pain, and the perceived association between pain and their meaning in life and sense of purpose. Data were submitted to thematic analysis and the identified themes were considered in light of the Meaning Making Model. RESULTS: Three overarching themes emerged, each of which included two themes. The first overarching theme - "appraised meaning of pain" - included the themes "causal attributions" and "primary appraisals." The second - "meaning making processes" - included the themes "assimilation" and "accommodation." The third - "meanings made" - included the themes "pain as an opportunity" and "acceptance." CONCLUSION: The key themes that emerged as individuals with chronic pain discussed pain and its impact are consistent with those that would be hypothesized as important from the Meaning Making Model, providing preliminary support for the utility of this model in the context of chronic pain. People with chronic pain appear to appraise pain in terms of its cause, controllability, threat, loss, or challenge. When a discrepancy between the appraised meaning of pain and one's global meaning emerged, participants engaged in meaning making processes (accommodation and assimilation), resulting in meanings made, such as a reappraised meaning of pain, perceptions of growth, and acceptance.

AB  - A randomized between-groups design was used to evaluate massage therapy versus relaxation therapy effects on chronic low back pain. Treatment effects were evaluated for reducing pain, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances, for improving trunk range of motion (ROM) and for reducing job absenteeism and increasing job productivity. Thirty adults (M age=41 years) with low back pain with a duration of at least 6 months participated in the study. The groups did not differ on age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity or gender. Sessions were 30 min long twice a week for 5 weeks. On the first and last day of the 5-week study participants completed questionnaires and were assessed for ROM. By the end of the study, the massage therapy group, as compared to the relaxation group, reported experiencing less pain, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance. They also showed improved trunk and pain flexion performance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical guidelines are derived from best research evidence and aim to: improve quality of non-specific low back pain (nsLBP) management and identify patients at risk of suffering chronic pain. However, guideline discordant attitudes and beliefs have been identified in healthcare students and practitioners, including osteopaths. DESIGN: A qualitative approach with elements of grounded theory was used to explore underlying attitudes and beliefs of practitioners/students working in a British osteopathic education institution. All participants rejected guideline recommendations for managing nsLBP. A constant comparative method was used to code and analyse emergent themes from transcript data. SUBJECTS: Purposive sampling identified 5 clinic tutors and 7 students; all participated in semi-structured interviews. INTERPRETATION: Our central theme was a 'Precedence of Osteopathy' over medicine and other manual therapies. Three subthemes were: 1) beliefs about self; 2) perceptions of others; 3) attitudes to guidelines and research. CONCLUSION: Participants possess a strong professional identity fostered by their education. This bestows autonomy, authority and distinctness upon them. The central theme was modelled as a lens through which participants viewed research: the evidence pyramid appears inverted, explaining why participants value expert opinion above all other evidence. Guidelines and research are perceived to threaten professional identity. In contractual situations that oblige practitioners to follow guidelines management, perhaps reflecting a pragmatic response to health-care market forces, clinical practice is modified. Developing further understanding of osteopaths' attitudes and beliefs and behaviour in respect of evidence-based guidance in education is important to enhance the quality of clinical practice in osteopathy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Pain Toolkit is a self-management tool for people with persistent pain. It is available for use worldwide in multiple formats. To date, no studies have investigated the effectiveness of this intervention. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the Pain Toolkit in comparison with a simple education control for people with low back pain. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Participants who have been discharged from the North of England Regional Back Pain Pathway will be randomised using sealed, consecutively numbered opaque envelopes to receive either the Pain Toolkit and the Back Book (intervention group) or the Back Book only (control group). Both the therapist and the participant will be blind to group allocation. The primary outcome measure will be disability (Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)). Secondary outcome measures will be pain (0-10 numerical scale), healthcare use (number of healthcare professional visits) and quality of life (EuroQol-5D). Outcome measures will be completed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Data will be analysed using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values. A change of 10 points in the ODI will be considered a clinically important change. Additionally, a subsample of participants from the intervention group will undergo semistructured interviews to explore individuals' experience of the Pain Toolkit. Participants will be asked questions about the ease of use and acceptability of the Pain Toolkit and also for how long they used the Toolkit. The qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approval for the study was given by the Health Research Authority and the North East Newcastle, North Tyneside 2 Regional Ethics Committee (reference 18/NE/0144) and Teesside University (reference 176/17). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and presentation at relevant patient groups, and local, national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03791164; Pre -results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The struggle with pain often interferes with the ability of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients to pursue important life values due to psychological inflexibility. OBJECTIVE: This research examined life values, related inhibitors and facilitators relevant to personalized therapy planning. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-four CLBP patients completed the Chronic Pain Values Inventory (CPVI). Of these, 68 patients were interviewed to assess inhibitors and facilitators related to life values. Mixed-effects models quantitatively examined differences in the values, structuring content analysis served to qualitatively analyze the interviews. RESULTS: Participants rated the value "family" as being of highest importance and success. The largest discrepancy between importance and success was found for "health". Content analyses revealed a broad range of inhibitors and facilitators related to the examined life values with the highest number of inhibitors related to "work". Facilitators were also found to be of relevance to all life values, but to a lower extent than inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: The perceived importance and success of life values and their related inhibitors and facilitators may differentially affect CLBP patients. Considering such individual aspects is therefore of utmost importance to improve patient care, as they enable treatment goals and the therapeutic strategies to be adapted accordingly.

AB  - Background Spinal synovial cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop after facet joint degeneration and can give rise to radicular pain. If resistant to conservative management, surgical decompression or percutaneous steroid treatment is usually recommended. Percutaneous treatment minimizes the risk of spinal instability, but it has been uncertain whether it provides any long-term symptom relief. Moreover, it is unclear whether cyst rupture provides any added benefit. Objective To assess long-term pain relief in patients with spinal synovial cysts who were treated with percutaneous intra-articular steroid treatment without cyst rupture. Methods A population-based cohort-study was conducted of all patients with symptomatic synovial cysts who were treated with percutaneous intra-articular steroid treatment without cyst rupture between 1995 and 2014. Results Thirty-eight patients were included. All patients had variations of lower back and radicular pain. Intra-articular access was achieved in 35 (92%) patients, and there were no treatment-related complications. At short-term assessment, 30 (79%) had pain relief. During the median follow-up of 11 years, 12 (32%) patients showed sustained pain relief without the need for decompressive surgery. Conclusions Percutaneous intra-articular steroid treatment without cyst rupture is a safe treatment for symptomatic spinal synovial cysts and eliminates the need for surgery in a substantial number of patients. It can be suggested as a first line of treatment.

AB  - Methods for detecting recruitment patterns of the lumbar muscles during exercise in patients with chronic low back pain are limited. This article discusses the use of magnetic resonance imaging with Roman chair extension exercise to examine lumbar muscle usage in five normal volunteers, five chronic low back pain patients without surgery, and five chronic low back pain patients with surgery. Changes in signal intensities of psoas, multifidus, and longissimus/iliocostalis with graded exercise were measured at three lumbar disc levels. At rest, there was a difference between multifidus and longissimus/iliocostalis signal intensity in chronic low back pain subjects without surgery (P = 0.0162) and in chronic low back pain subjects with surgery (P = 0.0036), but not in normal subjects. At peak exercise, there was a difference in signal intensities between multifidus and longissimus/iliocostalis in all groups (normal volunteers, P = 0.0069; chronic low back pain patients without surgery, P = 0.0125; chronic low back pain patients with surgery, P = 0.0060). The exercise response was attenuated in chronic low back pain patients with surgery. Thus, MRI demonstrates static and dynamic differences in lumbar paraspinal musculature in chronic low back pain subjects compared to normal subjects.

AB  - SUMMARY The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the promotion of mental health and prevention of depression among older people. A systematic review of prospective controlled trials was conducted including 69 studies. The studies were divided into physical exercise, skill training, reminiscence, social activities, group support and multicomponent interventions. Data from 44 trials contributed to a meta-analysis of effectiveness. Overall, psychosocial interventions had a positive effect on quality of life and positive mental health. The pooled interventions also had a statistically significant effect on reduction in depressive symptoms. Social activities significantly improved positive mental health, life satisfaction and quality of life and reduced depressive symptoms. Based on the results of this study, duration of interventions is of importance, since interventions lasting for .3 months exhibited more positive effects compared with shorter interventions. Meaningful social activities, tailored to the older individual’s abilities and preferences should be considered in aiming to improve mental health among older people.

AB  - The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare functional limitations and comorbidity prevalence between older adult users and nonusers of chiropractic and osteopathic (DC/DO) manipulation to inform provider training. We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey data. Adults age 65 or older who responded to the survey were included. Descriptive statistics are reported for adults who used DC/DO manipulation (vs nonusers) regarding function, comorbidities, musculoskeletal complaints, and medical services. Weighted percentages were derived using SAS and compared with χ2 tests. The DC/DO users were more often female, overweight or obese, and of white race than nonusers. More DC/DO users reported arthritis (55.3% vs 47.0%, <0.01) or asthma (15.0% vs 10.0%, P <.01) than nonusers; hypertension (61.9% vs 55.5%, P =.02) and diabetes (20.3% vs 15.7%, P =.02) were more prevalent in nonusers; and other comorbidities were comparable. The DC/DO users reported more joint pain/stiffness (55.7% vs 44.8%), chronic pain (19.8% vs 14.2%), low back pain (27.8% vs 18.4%), low back with leg pain (18.8% vs 10.6%), and neck pain (24.2% vs 13.1%) than nonusers (all P <.01). Functional limitations affected two-thirds overall, but DC/DO users reported more difficulties stooping and bending; other limitations were comparable. One in 9 reported activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living limitations; nonusers were more affected. Surgery was more common among DC/DO users (26.1% vs 19.3%, <0.01); emergency room visits were comparable. Differences existed between older adult manipulation users and nonusers, especially surgical utilization, musculoskeletal complaints, and comorbidities; functional differences were modest. Our findings highlight areas for provider training and awareness regarding comorbidity burden and management needs in older patients who may simultaneously use manipulation and medical care for musculoskeletal complaints.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many pregnant women experience low back pain. Acupuncture appears to be a safe, promising intervention but evidence is needed about its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of a future large randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing the additional benefit of adding acupuncture to standard care (SC) for pregnancy-related back pain. DESIGN: Phase 1: a questionnaire survey described current care for pregnancy-related back pain. Focus groups and interviews with midwives, physiotherapists and pregnant women explored acceptability and feasibility of acupuncture and the proposed RCT. Phase 2: a single-centre pilot RCT. Participants were identified using six methods and randomised to SC, SC plus true acupuncture or SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture. PARTICIPANTS: Phase 1: 1093 physiotherapists were surveyed and 15 midwives, 21 physiotherapists and 17 pregnant women participated in five focus groups and 20 individual interviews. Phase 2: 125 women with pregnancy-related back pain participated. INTERVENTIONS: SC: a self-management booklet and onward referral for one-to-one physiotherapy (two to four sessions) for those who needed it. SC plus true acupuncture: the self-management booklet and six to eight treatments with a physiotherapist comprising true (penetrating) acupuncture, advice and exercise. SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture: the self-management booklet and six to eight treatments with a physiotherapist comprising non-penetrating acupuncture, advice and exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pilot RCT outcomes included recruitment rates, treatment fidelity, follow-up rate, patient-reported pain and function, quality of life and health-care resource use. Birth and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Staff overseeing outcome data collection were blind to treatment allocation. RESULTS: Phase 1: 629 (57.5%) physiotherapists responded to the survey, 499 were experienced in treating pregnancy-related back pain and reported 16 advice and 18 treatment options. Typical treatment comprised two to four individual sessions of advice and exercise over 6 weeks. Acupuncture was reported by 24%. Interviews highlighted the impact of back pain and paucity of effective interventions. Women and midwives strongly supported a RCT and expressed few concerns. Physiotherapists' concerns about acupuncture in pregnancy informed a training programme prior to the pilot RCT. Phase 2: We recruited 125 of 280 potentially eligible women (45%) in 6 months and randomised 41 to SC and 42 each to the SC plus true acupuncture and SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture arms. Analysis was conducted with 124 participants (41, 42 and 41, respectively) as one participant was randomised in error. Three of six recruitment methods were the most successful. In total, 10% of women (n = 4) randomised to SC alone accessed one-to-one physiotherapy and received an average of two treatments. The average number of treatments was six for both SC plus true acupuncture and SC plus non-penetrating acupuncture. Treatments were in line with protocols. Eight-week follow-up was 74%. Patient-reported outcomes (pain, function and quality of life) favoured the addition of acupuncture. There was no evidence of serious adverse events on mothers or birth and neonatal outcomes. The Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire was found to be an appropriate outcome measure for a future trial. CONCLUSIONS: A future main RCT is feasible and would be welcomed by women and clinicians. Longer-term follow-up and further follow-up efforts are recommended for a main trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN49955124.

AB  - The growing interest in mindfulness interventions for use in aging samples has been met with promising evidence of cognitive, emotional, and physiological benefits. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the impact of mindfulness training on three areas of functioning in older adults: behavioral and neural correlates of attentional performance, psychological well-being, and systemic inflammation. We have previously proposed that mindfulness training is uniquely suited as a rehabilitative tool for conferring both cognitive and emotional benefits for older adults. Specifically, mindfulness training’s promotion of focused attention may mitigate the decline of attentional control abilities across late development and allow older adults to capitalize on their preserved emotion regulation abilities. Existing evidence points to some improvements in facets of attentional control in older adults, although some studies have shown no benefits in performance. Further, there is evidence of enhancements in both psychological and physical aspects of well-being, and accompanying improvements in systemic inflammation, following mindfulness training. The scientific investigation of mindfulness training is still relatively nascent, with only a limited number of studies, particularly randomized controlled trials utilizing active comparison conditions. It will be important for future research to incorporate placebo-controlled comparison groups to clearly establish the causal role of mindfulness practices in promoting holistic health in older adults.

AB  - Altered mechanics and/or forces related to the lumbar/pelvic/hip regions may result in pelvic-girdle dysfunction and or instability, which then may contribute to the development, persistence, or reoccurrence of low back pain (LBP). This series of three case studies outlines an integrated biomechanical clinical evaluation and treatment approach utilizing manual care, education, and exercise in the treatment of patients with chronic pelvic-girdle dysfunction and/or instability.This integrated approach was used on three patients with a primary diagnosis of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction. These patients had similar patterns of altered mechanics, movement patterns, and muscle imbalances. The treatment they received was an integration of three components: 1) restoration of optimal soft tissue/joint mechanics to the thoracic/lumbar/pelvic region and lower quarters; 2) patient education in specific self-stretching/mobilization exercises, spinal/ pelvic stabilization exercises, and body mechanics training; 3) pelvic external bracing and/or prolotherapy injections (sclerosing) for those patients with hypermobile/unstable, chronic and recurring pelvic girdle dysfunction. Treatment varied from 24 to 35 visits over a 3-4 month period. The treatment outcomes demonstrated a correlation between improved patient function and pain reduction after restoring optimal mobility, functional strength, and movement patterns. These benefits lasted well beyond the course of treatment. Further research is needed to determine whether patients with chronic pelvic-girdle dysfunction and/or instability who receive this integrated approach will consistently achieve lasting pain relief and restoration of function when compared with no treatment or other treatment approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe exercise prescription in routine clinical practice for individuals with chronic back or neck pain because, although current practice guidelines promote exercise for chronic back and neck pain, little is known about exercise prescription in routine care. METHODS: We conducted a computer-assisted telephone survey of a representative sample of individuals (n = 684) with chronic back or neck pain who saw a physician, chiropractor, and/or physical therapist (PT) in the past 12 months. Individuals were asked about whether they were prescribed exercise, the amount of supervision received, and the type, duration, and frequency of the prescribed exercise. Descriptive and multivariable regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Of the 684 subjects, 48% were prescribed exercise. Of those prescribed exercise, 46% received the prescription from a PT, 29% from a physician, 21% from a chiropractor, and 4% from other. In multivariable analyses, seeing a PT or a chiropractor were the strongest predictors of exercise prescription. The likelihood of exercise prescription was increased in women, those with higher education, and those receiving worker's compensation. PTs were more likely to provide supervision and prescribe strengthening exercises compared with physicians and chiropractors, and were more likely to prescribe stretching exercises compared with physicians. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that exercise is being underutilized as a treatment for chronic back and neck pain and, to some extent, that the amount of supervision and types of exercises prescribed do not follow current practice guidelines. Exercise prescription provided by PTs appears to be most in line with current guidelines.

AB  - This study sought to identify the prevalence of chronic low back pain and its associated factors in a population of women. A cross-sectional populationbased study was conducted with 1,128 women aged 20 to 69 and living in the urban area of São Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). Chronic low back pain was assessed by the presence of prevailing pain lasting for at least three months, and the investigated factors consisted of sociodemographic, behavioral and anthropometric aspects. The prevalence of chronic low back pain was 46.5% (95%CI: 43.6-49.4). After the adjustment, factors associated with the presence of chronic low back pain were: age, physical activity and nutritional status. We observed an association with a positive linear trend between age and low back pain. Furthermore, physically inactive and obese women presented, respectively, a 31% (PR=1.31; 95%CI: 1.05-1.64; p=0.02) and 25% (PR=1.25; 95%CI: 1.09-1.42; p<0.001) higher probability of presenting low back pain than those with normal body weight. In conclusion, we identified a high prevalence of chronic low back pain in women, and the main associated factors included: advanced age, physical inactivity and obesity. El objetivo de este estudio fue identificar la prevalencia de lumbalgia crónica y sus factores asociados en mujeres. Se realizó un estudio transversal, poblacional, con 1.128 mujeres de entre 20 y 69 años de edad, residentes en la zona urbana de São Leopoldo, en el estado de Rio Grande do Sul (Brasil). Para caracterizar lumbalgia crónica se evaluó la presencia de dolor durante al menos tres meses, y los factores investigados incluyeron aspectos sociodemográficos, conductuales y antropométricos. Los resultados apuntan una prevalencia de lumbalgia crónica del 46,5% (IC95%: 43,6-49,4). Tras el ajuste, los factores asociados a la lumbalgia crónica fueron: edad, actividad física y estado nutricional. Hubo una asociación de tendencia lineal positiva entre la edad y la lumbalgia, así como una probabilidad del 31% (RP=1,31; IC95%: 1,05-1,64; p=0,02) y del 25% (RP= 1,25; IC95%: 1,09-1,42; p<0,001) mayor de dolor lumbar en mujeres físicamente inactivas y obesas en comparación con mujeres físicamente activas y con peso corporal normal. Este estudio evidenció una alta prevalencia de lumbalgia crónica en mujeres y los principales factores asociados fueron la edad avanzada, la inactividad física y la obesidad. O objetivo deste estudo foi identificar a prevalência de dor lombar crônica e seus fatores associados em uma população de mulheres. Para isso, realizou-se um estudo transversal, de base populacional, com 1.128 mulheres com idade entre 20 e 69 anos e residentes na zona urbana de São Leopoldo, Rio Grande do Sul. A dor lombar crônica foi avaliada a partir da presença de dor com duração mínima de três meses, e os fatores investigados incluíram aspectos sociodemográficos, comportamentais e antropométricos. Os resultados indicaram uma prevalência de dor lombar crônica de 46,5% (IC95%: 43,6-49,4). Após ajuste, os fatores associados à dor lombar crônica foram: idade, atividade física e estado nutricional. Observou-se uma associação com tendência linear positiva entre idade e dor lombar, assim como uma probabilidade 31% (RP=1,31; IC95%: 1,05-1,64; p=0,02) e 25% (RP=1,25; IC95%: 1,09-1,42; p<0,001) maior de mulheres fisicamente inativas e obesas terem dor lombar, quando comparadas às mulheres fisicamente ativas e com peso corporal normal, respectivamente. Assim, este estudo evidenciou uma elevada prevalência de dor lombar crônica em mulheres, identificando como principais fatores associados a sua ocorrência a idade avançada, a inatividade física e a obesidade.

AB  - Study Design: A randomized controlled multicenter study with a 2-year follow-up by an independent observer.Objectives: To determine whether fusion of the lower lumbar spine could reduce pain and diminish disability more effectively when compared with nonsurgical treatment in patients with severe chronic low back pain (CLBP).Summary Of Background Data: The reported results after fusion surgery on patients with CLBP vary considerably, and the evidence of treatment efficacy is weak in the absence of randomized controlled studies.Patients and Methods: A total of 294 patients referred to 19 spinal centers from 1992 through 1998 were randomized blindly into four treatment groups. Patients aged 25-65 years with CLBP for at least 2 years and with radiologic evidence of disc degeneration at L4-L5, L5-S1, or both were eligible to participate in the study. The surgical group (n=222) included three different fusion techniques, not analyzed separately in this study. Patients in the nonsurgical group (n=72) were treated with different kinds of physical therapy. The surgical group comprised 49.5% men, and the mean age was 43 years. The corresponding figures for the nonsurgical group were 48.6% and 44 years. The patients had suffered from low back pain for a mean of 7.8 and 8.5 years and been on sick leave due to back pain for a mean of 3.2 and 2.9 years, respectively. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain. The Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire, the Million Score and the General Function Score (GFS) were used to measure disability. The Zung Depression Scale was used to measure depressive symptoms. The overall result was assessed by the patient and by an independent observer. Records from the Swedish Social Insurance were used to evaluate work disability. Patients who changed groups were included in the analyses of significance according to the intention-to-treat principle.Results: At the 2-year follow-up 289 of 294 (98%) patients, including 25 who had changed groups, were examined. Back pain was reduced in the surgical group by 33% (64 to 43), compared with 7% (63 to 58) in the nonsurgical group (P=0.0002). Pain improved most during the first 6 months and then gradually deteriorated. Disability according to Oswestry was reduced by 25% (47 to 36) compared with 6% (48 to 46) among nonsurgical patients (P=0.015), according to Million by 28% (64 to 46) compared with 8% (66 to 60) (P=0.004), and accordingtoGFS by 31% (49 to 34) compared with 4% (48 to 46) (P=0.005). The depressive symptoms, according to Zung, were reduced by 20% (39 to 31) in the surgical group compared with 7% (39 to 36) in the nonsurgical group (P=0.123). In the surgical group 63% (122/195) rated themselves as "much better" or "better" compared with 29% (18/62) in the nonsurgical group (P<0.0001). The "net back to work rate" was significantly in favor of surgical treatment, or 36% vs. 13% (P=0.002). The early complication rate in the surgical group was 17%.Conclusion: Lumbar fusion in a well-informed and selected group of patients with severe CLBP can diminish pain and decrease disability more efficiently than commonly used nonsurgical treatment.

AB  - Study Design: A cost-effectiveness study was performed from the societal and health care perspectives.Objective: To evaluate the costs-effectiveness of lumbar fusion for chronic low back pain (CLBP) during a 2-year follow-up.Summary Of Background Data: A full economic evaluation comparing costs related to treatment effects in patients with CLBP is lacking.Patients and Methods: A total of 284 of 294 patients with CLBP for at least 2 years were randomized to either lumbar fusion or a nonsurgical control group. Costs for the health care sector (direct costs), and costs associated with production losses (indirect costs) were calculated. Societal total costs were identified as the sum of direct and indirect costs. Treatment effects were measured using patient global assessment of improvement, back pain (VAS), functional disability (Owestry), and return to work.Results: The societal total cost per patient (standard deviations) in the surgical group was significantly higher than in the nonsurgical group: Swedish kroner (SEK) 704,000 (254,000) vs. SEK 636,000 (208,000). The cost per patient for the health care sector was significantly higher for the surgical group, SEK 123,000 (60,100) vs. 65,200 (38,400) for the control group. All treatment effects were significantly better after surgery. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), illustrating the extra cost per extra effect unit gained by using fusion instead of nonsurgical treatment, were for improvement: SEK 2,600 (600-5,900), for back pain: SEK 5,200 (1,100-11,500), for Oswestry: SEK 11,300 (1,200-48,000), and for return to work: SEK 4,100 (100-21,400).Conclusion: For both the society and the health care sectors, the 2-year costs for lumbar fusion was significantly higher compared with nonsurgical treatment but all treatment effects were significantly in favor of surgery. The probability of lumbar fusion being cost-effective increased with the value put on extra effect units gained by using surgery.

AB  - Little is known about the pattern, influencing factors of peer relationships, or their interplays amongst community-dwelling older people. This qualitative study was undertaken to understand and present these issues under the guidance of existing Adams-Blieszner-Ueno integrative conceptual framework for friendship in the context of China. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 20 older adults in Chongqing, China. Interview transcripts were then analysed by performing content analysis under the guidance of existing categories of Adams-Blieszner-Ueno integrative conceptual framework for friendship and developing separate categories inductively to ensure all data was captured. The results revealed four themes-context, individual characteristics, interactive motifs and peer relationship patterns-and 16 categories. Based on the original Adams-Blieszner-Ueno integrative conceptual framework for friendship, the revised framework for peer relationships modified two dimensions (from structural context to social context, friendship patterns to peer relationship patterns) and added two categories (natural context and health status) that emerge from the data. Besides, different dimensions in the modified framework for peer relationships are explicitly interrelated and not completely independent from each other. In conclusion, this study modified the pre-existing Adams-Blieszner-Ueno integrative conceptual framework for friendship, especially identifying two additional categories, natural context and health status, to understand peer relationships amongst the Chinese community-dwelling older people through careful examination of the data. All domains concerning the modified conceptual framework of peer relationship may serve as possible targets for developing peer-involved programs and thus improving social health, well-being and successful ageing of Chinese older people.

AB  - To describe the prevalence and patterns of morbidity among adults in Germany, we collected self-reported information on 22 chronic health conditions in a nationally representative health survey among 21,262 participants (51.5% women, aged 18-100 years). Age- and sex-specific prevalences were calculated for single health conditions, disease categories, the most prevalent disease dyads and triads, and for multimorbidity defined by condition count. In both sexes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic back pain, obesity, and osteoarthritis were the most prevalent single health conditions and significantly increased with age. Cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal conditions were the two most prevalent disease categories in all age and sex groups. The most prevalent disease category dyads and triads included combinations between cardiometabolic conditions, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease, depression, sensory limitations, and cancer. The prevalence and magnitude of multimorbidity strongly increased with age in both sexes. Among German adults, the prevalence of chronic health conditions varies greatly by age and sex. In contrast, patterns of morbidity and comorbidity differ according to age, but are highly consistent between men and women. The predominant role of cardiometabolic conditions in all groups underlines the need for preventive efforts. The co-occurrence of chronic health conditions among older is highly prevalent and this calls for tailoring health care towards specific disease combinations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: General practitioners and consultants in the Republic of Ireland manage patients with chronic low back pain (LBP), but little is known about the non-clinical factors that impact on their management. AIM: To establish the non-clinical factors that impact on the management of chronic LBP by a cohort of general practitioners and consultants. METHODS: Using a multiple case study design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with general practitioners (n = 7) and consultants (n = 7). Interviews were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. RESULTS: Two main themes emerged: policy factors (the health care system, the medico-legal system), and patient factors (need for reassurance, lack of patient adherence). CONCLUSIONS: These factors operate at national and local levels. Nationally, they underscore the lack of resources, and the impact of the medico-legal system. Local issues include changing practice by reassuring patients using evidence-based biopsychosocial strategies to maximise patient care and reduce healthcare costs.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. OBJECTIVE: To critically appraise the methodology of systematic reviews of conservative therapies for chronic nonspecific low back pain and to study the relation between the methodologic quality and other characteristics of these reviews. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Systematic reviews offer a concise summary of the evidence on treatment effectiveness, but flaws in their methodology can lead to invalid conclusions with serious implications for quality of patient care. METHODS: Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psychinfo, and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed by two blinded authors using three inclusion criteria: 1) chronic nonspecific low back pain, 2) systematic review, and 3) conservative treatment intervention. Data were extracted from each review by three authors. RESULTS: The search strategy retrieved 1102 titles and abstracts; 109 met inclusion criteria. A review of the full text of these articles excluded an additional 73 articles. Data abstraction and methodologic assessment were conducted on 36 articles reviewing 19 discrete interventions. The average quality score was 4.1, ranging from 1 (low) to 7 (high). There was a trend for recent reviews to be of higher quality. Fifty-six percent of the reviews had positive conclusions, but they had lower quality scores compared with those that had negative or uncertain conclusions. There were 27 (73%) qualitative and 10 (27%) quantitative summaries of results. CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall quality of systematic reviews was satisfactory, the quality of the individual papers included in the reviews varied considerably. The reviews often provided contradictory evidence on the effectiveness of a wide range of commonly used conservative interventions for chronic nonspecific low back pain. These findings illustrate the pitfalls of systematic reviews where there are a number of low-quality trials and underscore the need for high-quality primary trials that will allow for more conclusive reviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-back pain is one of the most common and costly musculoskeletal problems in modern society. Proponents of massage therapy claim it can minimize pain and disability, and speed return to normal function. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of massage therapy for non-specific low-back pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, HealthSTAR, CINAHL and Dissertation abstracts from their beginning to May 2001 with no language restrictions. References in the included studies and in reviews of the literature were screened. Contact with content experts and massage associations was also made. SELECTION CRITERIA: The studies had to be randomized or quasi-randomized trials investigating the use of any type of massage (using the hands or a mechanical device) as a treatment for non-specific low-back pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers blinded to authors, journal and institutions selected the studies, assessed the methodological quality using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group, and extracted the data using standardized forms. The studies were analysed in a qualitative way due to heterogeneity of population, massage technique, comparison groups, timing and type of outcome measured. MAIN RESULTS: Nine publications reporting on eight randomized trials were included. Three had low and five had high methodological quality scores. One study was published in German and the rest in English. Massage was compared to an inert treatment (sham laser) in one study that showed that massage was superior, especially if given in combination with exercises and education. In the other seven studies, massage was compared to different active treatments. They showed that massage was inferior to manipulation and TENS; massage was equal to corsets and exercises; and massage was superior to relaxation therapy, acupuncture and self-care education. The beneficial effects of massage in patients with chronic low-back pain lasted at least one year after the end of the treatment. One study comparing two different techniques of massage concluded in favour of acupuncture massage over classic (Swedish) massage. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Massage might be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low-back pain, especially when combined with exercises and education. The evidence suggest that acupuncture massage is more effective than classic massage, but this need confirmation. More studies are needed to confirm these conclusions and to assess the impact of massage on return-to-work, and to measure longer term effects to determine cost-effectiveness of massage as an intervention for low-back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-back pain is one of the most common and costly musculoskeletal problems in modern society. Proponents of massage therapy claim it can minimize pain and disability, and speed return to normal function. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of massage therapy for non-specific low-back pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL from their beginning to May 2008. We also searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2006, issue 3), HealthSTAR and Dissertation abstracts up to 2006. There were no language restrictions. References in the included studies and in reviews of the literature were screened. SELECTION CRITERIA: The studies had to be randomized or quasi-randomized trials investigating the use of any type of massage (using the hands or a mechanical device) as a treatment for non-specific low-back pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias using the criteria recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group, and extracted the data using standardized forms. Both qualitative and meta-analyses were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen randomized trials were included. Eight had a high risk and five had a low risk of bias. One study was published in German and the rest in English. Massage was compared to an inert therapy (sham treatment) in two studies that showed that massage was superior for pain and function on both short and long-term follow-ups. In eight studies, massage was compared to other active treatments. They showed that massage was similar to exercises, and massage was superior to joint mobilization, relaxation therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture and self-care education. One study showed that reflexology on the feet had no effect on pain and functioning. The beneficial effects of massage in patients with chronic low-back pain lasted at least one year after the end of the treatment. Two studies compared two different techniques of massage. One concluded that acupuncture massage produces better results than classic (Swedish) massage and another concluded that Thai massage produces similar results to classic (Swedish) massage. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Massage might be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low-back pain, especially when combined with exercises and education. The evidence suggests that acupuncture massage is more effective than classic massage, but this need confirmation. More studies are needed to confirm these conclusions, to assess the impact of massage on return-to-work, and to determine cost-effectiveness of massage as an intervention for low-back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although several studies have been conducted on the lived experiences of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) in high income countries, there is no published data on such experiences in Ghana. The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of persons with SCI in the Tamale Metropolis of the Northern Region of Ghana. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design involving thirteen participants was conducted at the Tamale Metropolis-Ghana. A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit participants, using the Neurosurgical Unit of the Tamale Teaching Hospital as an outlet for recruitment of the sample. Data was gathered mainly through face-to-face in-depth interviews. The data was analyzed concurrently with data collection, using thematic content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained for the study from the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research and the research unit of the Tamale Teaching Hospital. RESULTS: The three main themes that emerged from the data during analysis were "physical effects," "psychological effects," and "social issues." Conclusion. The findings from the study suggest that SCI is a life threatening condition and that persons with SCI grapple with a myriad of physical symptoms that range from chronic pain and paralysis of lower and/or upper limbs, to bladder and bowel incontinence. These physical symptoms have significant psychological and social effects on the functioning of the affected persons.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to evaluate a possible design for a 6-week modified hatha yoga protocol to study the effects on participants with chronic low back pain. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two participants (M = 4; F = 17), between the ages of 30 and 65, with chronic low back pain (CLBP) were randomized to either an immediate yoga based intervention, or to a control group with no treatment during the observation period but received later yoga training. METHODS: A specific CLBP yoga protocol designed and modified for this population by a certified yoga instructor was administered for one hour, twice a week for 6 weeks. Primary functional outcome measures included the forward reach (FR) and sit and reach (SR) tests. All participants completed Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires. Guiding questions were used for qualitative data analysis to ascertain how yoga participants perceived the instructor, group dynamics, and the impact of yoga on their life. ANALYSIS: To account for drop outs, the data were divided into better or not categories, and analyzed using chi-square to examine differences between the groups. Qualitative data were analyzed through frequency of positive responses. RESULTS: Potentially important trends in the functional measurement scores showed improved balance and flexibility and decreased disability and depression for the yoga group but this pilot was not powered to reach statistical significance. Significant limitations included a high dropout rate in the control group and large baseline differences in the secondary measures. In addition, analysis of the qualitative data revealed the following frequency of responses (1) group intervention motivated the participants and (2) yoga fostered relaxation and new awareness/learning. CONCLUSION: A modified yoga-based intervention may benefit individuals with CLB, but a larger study is necessary to provide definitive evidence. Also, the impact on depression and disability could be considered as important outcomes for further study. Additional functional outcome measures should be explored. This pilot study supports the need for more research investigating the effect of yoga for this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (PACT) is a novel intervention that is related to improved disability and functioning in people with chronic lowback pain. This study explored physiotherapists experiences over time of the PACT training programme and intervention delivery. DESIGN: A longitudinal qualitative study using semi-structured, in-depth, individual interviews at three time points was conducted. METHODS: A phenomenological approach underpinned the methods. Interviews followed topic-guides developed a priori. Transcribed interviews were coded inductively to generate themes. Data were member checked by participants and validated by two researchers. PARTICIPANTS: Eight clinical physiotherapists from three secondary care centres in the United Kingdom (n=5 female; age, 24 to 44 years; duration of practice, 3 to 14 years) were included. RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the data. Experiential learning techniques were challenging but valued because they bridged theoretical principles and concepts with practice. Ongoing individual and group supervision was beneficial, but required tailoring and tapering. PACT delivery extended physiotherapy skills and practice, including techniques that acknowledged and addressed patient treatment expectations. With experience, participants desired greater flexibility and autonomy to tailor PACT delivery. CONCLUSIONS: PACT training and delivery were acceptable to physiotherapists. Existing skills were developed and additional, applicable approaches were provided that addressed psychosocial and behavioural aspects of chronic low back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled trial of a new type of Physiotherapy informed by Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (PACT), found that it improved functioning in people with chronic low back pain compared to usual physiotherapy care. Fidelity evaluation is necessary to understand trial processes and outcomes. This study evaluated PACT treatment fidelity including delivery, receipt, and enactment. DESIGN: A mixed-methods study nested within a randomized controlled trial was conducted. METHODS: A total of 72 (20% of total) PACT treatment audio files were independently assessed by two raters, according to a novel framework developed to measure PACT treatment content adherence, therapeutic alliance, ACT competence, and treatment enactment. Interview transcripts from 19 trial participants randomized to PACT were analysed thematically for evidence of treatment receipt and enactment. RESULTS: PACT physiotherapists delivered treatment as intended with high content adherence and satisfactory therapeutic alliance, but ACT competence was low. Qualitative findings indicated participant receipt of 11/17 and enactment of 3/17 components; 89% (n = 17) and 47% (n = 9) of participants reported treatment receipt and enactment of at least one component, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This mixed-methods study of PACT treatment demonstrated high fidelity reflecting treatment content delivery and receipt, and therapeutic alliance. There was some evidence of treatment enactment in participants with chronic low back pain. Low ACT competence could be addressed through additional support and adaptations to therapeutic processes for delivery by physiotherapists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Along with quantitative measures, pain symptoms may help inform early interventions to prevent prolonged standing induced low back pain (LBP); however, the relationship between quantitative and qualitative measures has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE: Determine the relationship between qualitative and quantitative measures of pain development during prolonged standing induced LBP development. METHODS: Thirty-five participants performed two-hours of standing. A visual analog scale (VAS) and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire were used to assess the participant's LBP every 7.5-minutes. Participants were classified as a pain developer (PD) based on VAS scores or three consecutive pain symptom reports. RESULTS: Pain symptom reports occurred 31.3 (+/-24.8) minutes earlier than the VAS reports. Eight participants (44%) were non-PDs with the VAS and PDs with the symptom method (p = 0.0047). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of participants who were not categorized as LBP developers during prolonged standing using the VAS method still report LBP symptoms. The inclusion of pain symptom reporting could provide additional information for practitioners when identifying individuals who would benefit from early interventions for standing induced LBP.

AB  - This pilot study aims to investigate whether a novel mind–body intervention, Mindfulness Based Tinnitus Stress Reduction (MBTSR), may be a beneficial treatment for chronic tinnitus. Eight tinnitus patients who had previously received Tinnitus Counseling (standard of care) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Audiology Clinic participated in the MBTSR program. The program included 8 weeks of group instruction on mindfulness practice, a 1-day retreat, supplementary readings, and home-based practice using meditation CDs. Using a pre–post intervention design, mean differences (paired t-tests) were calculated. Benefits were measured by a reduction in clinical symptoms, if present, and a tinnitus symptom perception shift. Tinnitus symptom activity and discomfort as well as psychological outcomes were assessed by self-report questionnaires. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered. Results indicate that Effect Sizes, if supported by a larger study, may be clinically significant and demonstrate a substantial decrease for items measuring perceived annoyance and perception of handicap of tinnitus. Change scores on study measures all moved in the hypothesized direction, with the exception of negligible change found for the Acting with Awareness (d = −0.05) factor of mindfulness. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an 8-week MBTSR program may be an effective intervention for treating chronic tinnitus and its comorbid symptoms, and may help reduce depression and phobic anxiety while improving social functioning and overall mental health. These promising findings warrant further investigation with a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Personal convictions in referral to pain cause misbeliefs in health professionals, which can influence patients who suffer from non-specific chronic low back pain. Likewise, health professionals' beliefs affect their advice and attitudes towards patients' treatment, becoming a possible cause of greater disability. The development of educational interventions based on the best scientific evidence in neurophysiology of pain could be a way to provide information and advice to primary care health professionals to change their cognition towards chronic non-specific low back pain. The use of Information and Communication Technologies allows the development of web sites, which might be one of the effective resources to modify misbeliefs and attitudes, in relation to the origin and meaning of non-specific chronic low back pain, of primary care professionals and that may modify their attitudes in patients' treatment. METHODS: The aim of this project is to identify misbeliefs and attitudes of primary care physicians and nurses about chronic non-specific low back pain to develop a web-based educational tool using different educational formats and gamification techniques. This study has a mixed-method sequential exploratory design. The participants are medical and nursing staff working in primary care centers in the city of Lleida, Spain. For the qualitative phase of this study, the authors will use personal semi-structured interviews. For the quantitative phase the authors will use an experimental study design. Subjects will be randomly allocated using a simple random sample technique. The intervention group will have access to the web site where they will find information related to non-specific chronic low back pain, based on the information obtained in the qualitative phase. The control group will have access to a video explaining the clinical practice guidelines on low back pain. DISCUSSION: This study has been designed to explore and modify the beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain of physicians and nurses working in primary care settings, using a web-based educational tool with different educational formats and gamification techniques. The aim of the educational intervention is to change their knowledge about the origin and meaning of pain, with the result of reducing their misbeliefs and attitudes of fear avoidance.

AB  - AIM: To identify misbeliefs about the origin and meaning of non-specific chronic low back pain and to examine attitudes towards treatment by primary health care providers. DESIGN: Generic qualitative study. METHODS: Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted between October and November 2016 with physicians and nurses from primary health care centres in Lleida. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis via Atlas.ti-8 software. RESULTS: Five themes were identified: i. beliefs about the origin and meaning of chronic low back pain, ii. psychosocial aspects of pain modulators, iii. Therapeutic exercise as a treatment for chronic low back pain, iv. biomedical attitudes of primary health care providers, and v. difficulties in the clinical approach to chronic low back pain. CONCLUSION: Primary health care providers have a unifactorial view of chronic low back pain and base their approach on the biomedical model. Professionals attribute chronic low back pain to structural alterations in the lumbar spine while psychosocial factors are only recognized as pain modulators. For professionals, therapeutic exercise represents a possible solution to chronic low back pain; however, they still do not prescribe it and continue to educate on postural hygiene and recommend limiting physical and/or occupational activities, as opposed to clinical practice guidelines. These findings suggest that to improve the adherence of primary health care providers to the biopsychosocial model, it may be necessary first to modify their misbeliefs about non-specific chronic low back pain by increasing their knowledge on pain neurophysiology.

AB  - QUESTION: What influence do physiotherapists' beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain have on their clinical management of people with chronic low back pain? DESIGN: Systematic review with data from quantitative and qualitative studies. Quantitative and qualitative studies were included if they investigated an association between physiotherapists' attitudes and beliefs about chronic low back pain and their clinical management of people with chronic low back pain. RESULTS: Five quantitative and five qualitative studies were included. Quantitative studies used measures of treatment orientation and fear avoidance to indicate physiotherapists' beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain. Quantitative studies showed that a higher biomedical orientation score (indicating a belief that pain and disability result from a specific structural impairment, and treatment is selected to address that impairment) was associated with: advice to delay return to work, advice to delay return to activity, and a belief that return to work or activity is a threat to the patient. Physiotherapists' fear avoidance scores were positively correlated with: increased certification of sick leave, advice to avoid return to work, and advice to avoid return to normal activity. Qualitative studies revealed two main themes attributed to beliefs and attitudes of physiotherapists who have a relationship to their management of chronic low back pain: treatment orientation and patient factors. CONCLUSION: Both quantitative and qualitative studies showed a relationship between treatment orientation and clinical practice. The inclusion of qualitative studies captured the influence of patient factors in clinical practice in chronic low back pain. There is a need to recognise that both beliefs and attitudes regarding treatment orientation of physiotherapists, and therapist-patient factors need to be considered when introducing new clinical practice models, so that the adoption of new clinical practice is maximised.

AB  - Pain is a common complaint in primary care, with chronic pain reported in 20% of visits to general practitioners (McCaffrey et al., 2003). Twenty percent of adults suffer from chronic pain, rising to half of those of the older age population (Cousins et al., 2004). Chronic pain, defined as “intermittent or continuous pain persisting longer than six months or beyond the regular healing time for a given injury” can impact on patients’ physical and emotional well-being (Siddall et al., 2004) and may be associated with disability disproportionate to degree of injury, as well as with depression and anxiety (Bair et al., 2003). Despite analgesics, surgeries and procedures, pain is poorly controlled by traditional Western medicine (Cousins et al., 2004, Furrow, 2001). Opioids are sometimes prescribed for chronic pain, but the undesirable side-effects of these drugs and their ability to lose their effects over time are well-documented (Gardner-Nix, 2003). Consequently, many patients have turned to alternative modalities to control their suffering. Psychological factors such as mood changes and anxiety have been shown to alter pain perception (Jensen et al., 1994; Villemure and Bushnell, 2002). A meta-analysis of psychological interventions for chronic low back pain (Hoffman et al., 2007) provided support for the efficacy of psychological interventions in reducing self-reported pain, pain-related interference, depression, and disability in sufferers of low back pain. The study also demonstrated that multidisciplinary programs that included psychological interventions were superior to other active treatment programs at improving work-related outcomes at both short and long-term follow-up. The workings of the mind in appreciating pain (Seminowicz and Davis, 2007) and even in permitting or clearing painful responses such as inflammation, nerve irritation and muscle spasm at painful body sites are especially interesting in view of studies showing no correlations between pain

AB  - Recent research has clearly demonstrated the important role that psychopathology and other psychosocial factors can play in chronic low back pain disability (CLBPD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether diagnosed psychopathology is a significant limiting factor in the successful rehabilitation of patients with CLBPD. One hundred fifty-two CLBPD patients (97 men, 55 women) were given a structured psychiatric interview for official DSM-III-R diagnosis of psychopathology upon entering an intensive 3-week functional restoration treatment program. All patients were assessed for the presence of Axis I clinical disorders and Axis II personality disorders. They were subsequently tracked for 1 year after program completion, with treatment outcome being defined as return-to-work status at this 1-year time period. Results demonstrated that, though more than 90% of patients obtained at least one Axis I diagnosis, and more than 50% obtained at least one Axis II diagnosis, neither type nor degree of psychopathology were significantly predictive of a patient's ability to successfully return to work. These prospective study results suggest that if a treatment program is structured to appropriately manage psychopathology, as is the case of an intensive functional restoration program, then psychopathology does not have to interfere with successful treatment outcome.

AB  - In an attempt to prevent acute low-back pain from becoming a chronic disability problem, an earlier study developed a statistical algorithm which accurately identified those acute low-back pain patients who were at high risk for developing such chronicity. The major goal of the present study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of employing an early intervention program with these high-risk patients in order to prevent the development of chronic disability at a 1-year follow-up. Approximately 700 acute low-back pain patients were screened for their high-risk versus low-risk status. On the basis of this screening, high-risk patients were then randomly assigned to one of two groups: a functional restoration early intervention group (n = 22), or a nonintervention group (n = 48). A group of low-risk subjects (n = 54) who did not receive any early intervention was also evaluated. All these subjects were prospectively tracked at 3-month intervals starting from the date of their initial evaluation, culminating in a 12-month follow-up. During these follow-up evaluations, pain disability and socioeconomic outcomes (such as return-to-work and healthcare utilization) were assessed. Results clearly indicated that the high-risk subjects who received early intervention displayed statistically significant fewer indices of chronic pain disability on a wide range of work, healthcare utilization, medication use, and self-report pain variables, relative to the high-risk subjects who do not receive such early intervention. In addition, the high-risk nonintervention group displayed significantly more symptoms of chronic pain disability on these variables relative to the initially low-risk subjects. Cost-comparison savings data were also evaluated. These data revealed that there were greater cost savings associated with the early intervention group versus the no early intervention group. The overall results of this study clearly demonstrate the treatment- and cost-effectiveness of an early intervention program for acute low-back pain patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The health of a carer is a key factor which can affect the well-being of the child with disabilities for whom they care. In low-income countries, many carers of children with disabilities contend with poverty, limited public services and lack assistive devices. In these situations caregiving may require more physical work than in high-income countries and so carry greater risk of physical injury or health problems. There is some evidence that poverty and limited access to health care and equipment may affect the physical health of those who care for children with disabilities. This study seeks to understand this relationship more clearly. METHODS: A mixed methods study design was used to identify the potential physical health effects of caring for a child with moderate-severe motor impairments in Kilifi, Kenya. Qualitative data from in-depth interviews were thematically analysed and triangulated with data collected during structured physiotherapy assessment. RESULTS: Carers commonly reported chronic spinal pain of moderate to severe intensity, which affected essential activities. However, carers differed in how they perceived their physical health to be affected by caregiving, also reporting positive benefits or denying detrimental effects. Carers focussed on support in two key areas; the provision of simple equipment and support for their children to physically access and attend school. CONCLUSIONS: Carers of children with moderate-severe motor impairments live with their own physical health challenges. While routine assessments lead to diagnosis of simple musculoskeletal pain syndromes, the overall health status and situation of carers may be more complex. As a consequence, the role of rehabilitation therapists may need to be expanded to effectively evaluate and support carers' health needs. The provision of equipment to improve their child's mobility, respite care or transport to enable school attendance is likely to be helpful to carers and children alike.

AB  - Developing countries are experiencing rapid population ageing. Many do not have the resources or formal structures available to support the health and wellbeing of people as they age. In other contexts, the use of peer support programmes have shown favourable outcomes in terms of reducing loneliness, increasing physical activity and managing chronic disease. Such programmes have not been previously developed or tested in African countries. We piloted a peer-to-peer support model among vulnerable community-dwelling adults in a developing country (South Africa) to examine the program’s effect on wellbeing and social engagement. A pre-post, pilot design was used to evaluate targeted outcomes, including wellbeing, social support, social interaction, mood, loneliness and physical activity. A total of 212 persons, aged 60+ years and living independently in a low-income area in Cape Town were recruited and screened for eligibility by trained assessors. Participants were assessed using the interRAI CheckUp, WHO-5 Wellbeing index, and the MOS-SS 8 instruments before and after the 5-month intervention, during which they received regular visits and phone calls from trained peer volunteers. During visits volunteers administered a wellness screening, made referrals to health and social services; built friendships with clients; encouraged social engagement; promoted healthy living; and provided emotional and informational support. Volunteer visits with clients significantly increased levels of self-reported wellbeing by 58%; improved emotional and informational support by 50%; decreased reports of reduced social interaction by 91%; reduced loneliness by 70%; improved mood scores represented as anxiety, depression, lack of interest or pleasure in activities, and withdrawal from activities of interest; and increased levels of physical activity from 49 to 66%. The intervention led to demonstrable improvement in client wellbeing. Policymakers should consider integrating peer-support models into existing health programs to better address the needs of the elderly population and promote healthy ageing in resource-poor community settings. Longer-term and more rigorous studies with a control group are needed to support these findings and to investigate the potential impact of such interventions on health outcomes longitudinally.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and compliance to a short center-based intensive rehabilitation program followed by a home-based program for chronic low back pain. METHODS: Open prospective study in patients with chronic low back pain. The program included five weekly meetings of 12 day. Followed by a home-based program consigned on a booklet. Evaluation of deficiencies (lumbar and radicular pains on an analog visual scale, Schober Mac Rae test, distance finger-ground, Shirado test, Sorensen test), disabilities (Quebec functional index), and handicap (analog visual scale) were assessed at J0, five weeks, three months and one year. Compliance was assessed quantitatively (a number of exercises, duration of the meetings, numbers meetings per week) and qualitatively (semi-quantitative ordinal scale). Patient's global opinion on the effectiveness of the program was collected on a semi-quantitative ordinal scale. RESULTS: 60 patients (20 women), aged of 45 +/- 10,4 years, were included. Duration of the symptoms was 110 +/- 123 months. At five weeks, a significant improvement of all parameters was observed. This improvement was maintained at three months. At 12 months, there was no more significant improvement. Compliance to the program was 64,4%. 40.7% of the patient did not realize their exercises correctly. The majority gave up back muscle isometric reinforcement exercises. Score of Shirado test, Quebec index and EVA handicap were significantly different in the group realizing the home-base program. At one year, 79% of the patients regarded this program as useful. CONCLUSION: Although quantitative compliance with the home-based program can be considered as satisfactory, the effectiveness of this intensive rehabilitation program of lumbar decrease after three months. This can be explained by a fast deterioration of qualitative compliance. The effectiveness of a short supervised program between 3 and 6 months associated a more powerful message of motivation must be evaluated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultra-micronized palmitoylethanolamide (um-PEA) represents an attractive option for chronic pain control in complex older patients at higher risk of adverse effects with traditional analgesics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of um-PEA versus placebo on chronic pain intensity and function in individual geriatric patients. DESIGN: We performed randomized, blinded N-of-1 trials with two 3-week um-PEA versus placebo comparisons, separated by 2-week washout periods. PARTICIPANTS: The study included outpatients aged >= 65 years with chronic, non-cancer, non-ischemic pain in the back, joints, or limbs. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to Um-PEA 600 mg or placebo twice daily. MEASUREMENTS: Pain intensity was measured using an 11-point visual numeric scale. Functional impairment was measured using a Back Pain Functional Scale. Impact of each N-of-1 trial was measured on the clinician's intention to treat and confidence. RESULTS: Ten of 11 eligible patients consented over 7 months [all female, mean age 83.2 years (SD 4.6)]. Three patients interrupted the trial: one had diarrhea (under placebo), one for low adherence, and one for intercurrent pneumonia. A small statistically significant effect in favor of um-PEA was seen at the mixed method analyses in two patients (effect size equal to 8% of the baseline pain). A statistically significant impact on function was found in one patient. After the trial, um-PEA was prescribed to four patients; in two patients the clinician changed their pre-trial intention to treat; the clinician confidence in the treatment plan either increased (5) or remained the same (2). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience confirmed that N-of-1 trials may help make personalized evidence-based decisions in complex older patients, with special feasibility considerations.

AB  - Little is known about long-term pain after a fragility fracture. In this secondary analysis, we determined that pain continues to influence many patients' lives more than 1 year after a fracture and that health care providers do not seem to adequately recognize or manage these long-term consequences. INTRODUCTION: We characterized perspectives on long-term pain among men and women who had sustained a fragility fracture. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data from 67 individuals recruited in three primary studies (47-89 years old; 55 women, 12 men). Eligible individuals from the primary studies were those who had reported pain related to their fracture beyond 6 months. Data about reported pain were re-analyzed using qualitative description as articulated by Sandelowski. RESULTS: Thirty-four individuals (47-89 years old; 4 men; 8 had sustained a vertebral fracture) reported pain related to their fracture in the primary studies. Thirty-one (91%) participants had sustained a fragility fracture at least 1 year previously (range 1-13 years). Patients described long-term pain beyond typical fracture healing times, generally unrelieved by analgesics, which affected their mobility, functional activity, independence, sleep, and energy. Health care providers were perceived to under-estimate timelines regarding the decrease of post-fracture pain and to not manage that pain. Participants reported that pain management was inadequate and that they developed their own strategies to respond to it. CONCLUSIONS: Pain continues to influence many patients' lives more than 1 year after a fragility fracture. Patient narratives could be useful to help health care providers to better recognize and manage this long-term consequence of fractures.

AB  - Mindfulness is often used as an umbrella term to characterize a large number of practices, processes, and characteristics. Critics argue that this broad definition has led to misinformation, misunderstanding, and a general lack of methodologically rigorous research. Some of the confusion surrounding mindfulness is also believed to stem from an undifferentiated use of the term mindfulness and meditation. Mindfulness and all other forms of meditation have been shown to modulate the insula which is the primary hub for interoception. Some have argued that interoception is foundational to mindfulness and may be the primary mechanism by which one benefits from the practice. However, much like the mindfulness literature, interoception remains broadly defined often without precision and with domain-specific meanings and implications. Research demonstrates that the insula and surrounding neural circuits are believed to be responsible for a number of other functions beyond interoception including attention, awareness, and all subjective experiences, much of which has been linked to the mindfulness literature. It has been assumed that mindfulness produces these neuroplasticity and functional effects. There is evidence that mindfulness and some of its benefits may be better described as increased interoception as a result of the neuroplasticity changes in the insula, and the development of the insula and surrounding neural circuits may cultivate dispositional mindfulness. The purposes of this paper are to (1) highlight that it may be more accurate to link many of the identified benefits in the mindfulness literature to interoception and its neurological correlates, and (2) propose attentional style as a means to clarify some of the confusion surrounding mindfulness, interoception, and meditation. Different meditations and require different attentional styles. Attention can be analogous to a focal point with each focal point providing a unique perspective. Given that all meditative techniques modulate the insula, each meditation can provide a unique perspective from which to investigate complex interoceptive signals that may be unavailable from other meditative traditions. It may prove more useful to anchor scientific findings in the concrete body as a means to investigate those rather than a set of abstract, broadly defined meditative techniques.

AB  - Aim. This paper is a report of a study to explore the experiences of 'almost old' women as they grow older while living with a chronic condition. Background. Little is known about the contextual effects of ageing and how it shapes and is shaped by a woman's chronic illness experience. Nurses' understanding of this phenomenon can have positive effects on how their client accesses and responds to healthcare. Method. Seven women aged between 50 and 58 years participated in this interpretive descriptive study that explored the issues of ageing with a chronic condition. Three focus groups were held between March 2003 and March 2004. Transcriptions were analyzed after each focus group. Participants were given the opportunity to respond to the findings as the analysis progressed. Findings. The experience of living with a chronic illness foreshadowed what was to come with ageing and embodied the ageing process: it was just part of their lives. Alongside this, the women now felt less out of place. Their peers were catching up and beginning to experience aspects of participants' everyday reality. The women, however, experienced double jeopardy because ageing amplified the ongoing vulnerabilities of living with a chronic condition. Conclusion. Nurses who recognize the resourcefulness and expertise of women who live with a chronic condition can effectively be co-strategists in their helping them to age well.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent musculoskeletal pain is a multi-factorial entity, influenced by biological, genetic and psychosocial factors. Psychosocial factors, such as individuals' beliefs and experiences, need to be considered in the management of such pain. While extensive research has explored beliefs of individuals with spinal pain, less is known about individuals' beliefs regarding shoulder pain. OBJECTIVES: To explore beliefs about the cause of pain in individuals with persistent rotator cuff-related pain, as well as the experiences of the effect of pain on their daily lives. DESIGN: A mixed methods design, using semi-structured interviews and validated outcome questionnaires. METHOD: Five men and five women, aged 47-68 years, with shoulder pain for at least three months were recruited. Individual semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using the general inductive approach. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Four key themes emerged. The cause of pain, 'Understanding the pain', was described in terms of anatomical factors within the context of the participants' lives. The pain impacted all areas of life, creating another theme, 'It affects everything'. Participants responded to their pain by adopting certain, 'Pain-associated behaviours' and sought information for diagnosis, general management and exercise prescription, 'Emotional responses and the future'. CONCLUSIONS: The participants with rotator cuff-related pain believed the cause of their pain to be local to the shoulder region. However, they also described various stressors in their work-, sports- and family-related lives. Rehabilitation may need to include educating the individual, expanding their understanding regarding pain mechanisms and appropriate interventions, based on individual goal-setting.

AB  - The contribution of bacterial infection to chronic low back pain and its treatment with antibiotics have generated considerable controversy in literature. If efficacious, antibiotics have the potential to transform the treatment of chronic low back pain in a significant subset of patients. Some microbiology studies of disc tissue from patients with CLBP have shown that bacteria are present, most likely due to infection, while others conclude they are absent or if found, it is due to surgical contamination. Clinical studies testing the efficacy of oral antibiotics to treat CLBP have either shown that the treatment is efficacious leading to significantly reduced pain and disability or that their effect is modest and not clinically significant. Critical review of the literature on CLBP, bacterial infection and treatment with antibiotics identified five well-designed and executed microbiology studies characterizing bacteria in disc samples that demonstrate that bacteria do infect herniated disc tissue, but that the bacterial burden is low and may be below the limits of detection in some studies. Two randomized, controlled clinical trials evaluating oral antibiotics in patients with CLBP indicate that for certain subsets of patients, the reduction in pain and disability achieved with antibiotic therapy may be significant. In patients for whom other therapies have failed, and who might otherwise progress to disc replacement or fusion surgery, antibiotic therapy may well be an attractive option to reduce the individual suffering associated with this debilitating condition. Additional clinical research is recommended to refine the selection of patients with CLBP caused or complicated by bacterial infection and most likely to respond to antibiotics, to optimize antibiotic therapy to maximize patient benefit, to minimize and manage side effects, and to address legitimate concerns about antibiotic stewardship.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the number of minutes a day of leisure time physical activity (LTPA) performed by people with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and to identify the demographic and injury-related characteristics associated with LTPA in a population-based sample of people with chronic SCI. DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women with SCI (N=695). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of minutes/day of LTPA performed at a mild intensity or greater. RESULTS: Respondents reported mean minutes +/- SD of 27.14+/-49.36 of LTPA/d; however, 50% reported no LTPA whatsoever. In a multiple regression analysis, sex, age, years postinjury, injury severity, and primary mode of mobility each emerged as a unique predictor of LTPA. Multiple correspondence analysis indicated that being a man over the age of 34 years and greater than 11 years postinjury was associated with inactivity, while being a manual wheelchair user and having motor complete paraplegia were associated with the highest level of daily LTPA. CONCLUSIONS: Daily LTPA levels are generally low in people with SCI. Women, older adults, people with less recent injuries, people with more severe injuries, and users of power wheelchairs and gait aids are general subgroups that may require special attention and resources to overcome unique barriers to LTPA. Specific subgroups may also require targeted interventions. Copyright © 2010 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine

AB  - Neuropathic pain is a complex, chronic, and disabling condition that has physical, functional, and psychosocial repercussions. Although the estimated prevalence of neuropathic pain in the general population ranges from 1.5% to 8%, neuropathic pain is frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. The aims of this study were to examine the experience of patients treated with spinal cord stimulation as a pain-relieving treatment and how this may influence the patient's ability to participate in everyday life activities. A qualitative approach based on seven telephone interviews was performed. The participants were recruited from a university hospital in Norway, and all used spinal cord stimulation as a pain-relieving treatment. Qualitative content analysis was used. Two thematic findings emerged: (1) pain relief with spinal cord stimulation as a complex and individual experience and (2) challenges in adaptations in everyday life with spinal cord stimulation. Findings indicate that spinal cord stimulation can offer pain relief that can help patients achieve a meaningful life despite chronic pain. Spinal cord stimulation also may have disadvantages that should be considered before offering this treatment. It seems evident that extended information needs about working mechanism of SCS and precautions as well as follow-up are required to meet unexpected challenges in adaptation. Here the nurse has an important role when informing and following this patient group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus regarding the effectiveness of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for chronic musculoskeletal or low back pain. A review of previous trial methodology identified problems with treatment fidelity. Qualitative research with experienced TENS users identified specific contexts for TENS use, leading to individualised outcomes. There is little information available to guide the selection of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) appropriate for TENS evaluation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the capability of previously used PROMs to capture the perceived benefits of TENS reported by secondary care Pain Clinic patients who successfully used TENS to manage chronic musculoskeletal pain. DESIGN: The World Health Organisation International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) was used to match the perceived benefits of TENS against previously used PROMS. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews conducted with nine patients (6 women) as well as three other qualitative datasets (88 patients in total) generated patient-reported benefits which were matched against previously used PROMs using the ICF. FINDINGS: There were 18 items in the final list of benefits, and none of the four functional outcome measures used in previous RCTs captured more than 8 of these 18 items. The data analysis complemented the inductive thematic analysis but could not replace it, indicating the value of both forms of analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights a low level of match between outcome measures used in previous TENS studies, and the benefits perceived by experienced TENS users. This suggests that further work is required if the patient-reported benefits of TENS are to be evaluated.

AB  - Background and objectives: There is a lack of good quality evidence regarding the effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for chronic musculoskeletal pain, including chronic low back pain. High quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been called for to establish effectiveness over and above placebo and some guidance has already been offered regarding the design of such trials. This article expands the discussion regarding the design of future TENS trials. There is qualitative evidence of the complexity of TENS as an intervention which should be considered in future TENS evaluations. This complexity includes multiple benefits reported by patients, depending on their chosen contexts of TENS use. The ideal content and delivery of support for patients to optimise TENS use also lacks consensus. There is no evidence that a TENS education package has been designed to support the complex set of behaviours and choices which experienced users suggest are required to optimise TENS benefits. Finally, clinical and research outcomes have not been contextualised and related to the specific strategies of use. Conclusions: We suggest that research is required to develop consensus about the content and delivery of training in TENS use for patients who live with pain, informed by the experience of patients, clinicians, and researchers. Once a consensus about the content of TENS training has been reached, there is then a need to develop a TENS training course (TTC) based on this content. An effective and acceptable TTC is needed to develop the knowledge and skills required to optimise TENS use, supporting patients to build confidence in using TENS in everyday life situations with the aim of reducing the impact of chronic pain on function and quality of life. Further research is required to extend the evidence base regarding appropriate, contextualised TENS patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - Objective: This study explored and analysed how patients experienced possibilities for, and barriers to, work return after participation in a multi-professional pain-rehabilitation program followed by a coached work-training program (CWT). Participants: Eleven informants (8 women/3 men) with long-term musculoskeletal pain who had participated in the CWT program for 4-21 months (mean=11) comprised the study. Methods: A qualitative emergent design was used. Data collected with interviews were analysed using the constant comparison method of grounded theory. Triangulation in researchers were used. Results: The analyses of the interviews resulted in the development of a three-category theoretical model, which was named 'a way back to work'. The main category 'Experience of a way back to work' consisted of the informants' experience during the process between unemployment and employment. The category 'Support' describes the help the informants received from various actors, and the category 'Negative response' describes negative responses from the actors involved, which was an important barrier in the process between unemployment and employment. Conclusion: Professional individualised support, participants feeling involved in their rehabilitation process, coaching at real workplaces and multi-professional team including health care personnel, were valuable during the process towards work.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim was to determine if laser acupuncture (LA) is more effective than sham laser in reducing pain and disability in adults with chronic non-specific low back pain. METHODS: The design was a double blind, two-group parallel randomised controlled trial. The active intervention was an 830 nm (infrared), 10 mW, Ga-Al-As laser diode laser for acupuncture and a sham control. The primary outcome measures were changes in pain (visual analogue scale) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index) at the end of 5-10 treatment sessions. Secondary outcomes were patient global assessment, psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and subjective wellbeing (Personal Wellbeing Index). Follow up was performed at 6 weeks and 6 months after completion of treatment. RESULTS: 100 participants were enrolled and treated in a general practice setting. Per protocol analysis of the primary outcome measures using ANOVA suggested that although there was a significant overall improvement in pain and disability after the course of treatments (p<0.01), there was no significant difference between the intervention and control group in both the primary and most secondary outcome measures. CONCLUSION: This study did not show a specific effect for LA using infrared laser at 0.2 Joules per point for chronic low back pain. The overall intervention appeared effective because of placebo and other factors. As there was some concern about baseline inequality between the groups further research using tighter inclusion criteria should attempt to replicate the result and examine if a dose response may exist.

AB  - Introduction (comprising context and problem statement): People's experience of treatment and community supports relies on tools which support person-centred planning and the integration of care. We undertook an extensive evaluation of the uptake, stakeholder use and experience of an integrated person-centred planning toolkit (My Plan) 15 months following its implementation. Description of policy context and objective: The My Plan toolkit was designed in response to national and international developments in the disability sector. It includes a series of modules which start with a "getting to know you" period (Engage Phase) when a participant is approaching discharge from hospital. It encompasses an assessment and "getting to know you better" period (Assess Phase) which might last 3 to 4 months post discharge. This culminates in the development of a plan (Plan Phase) which articulates the participants own goals, but also identifies the contribution of family, rehabilitation team and personal assistant providers. Target population: My Plan was designed for use with participants of the Lifetime Care and Support Authority, NSW Australia (icare lifetime care) who sustained catastrophic injury through motor vehicle crashes in NSW, Australia. Highlights (innovation, impact and outcomes): The evaluation of My Plan involved quantitative, qualitative information, and the corroboration of information and data obtained through multiple semi-structured interviews, surveys of all stakeholders (participants, planning facilitators, staff), and file reviews of My Plan modules. Comments on sustainability: The evaluation of the integrated person-centred planning My Plan toolkit confirmed participants and families view planning and the My Plan approach positively and the planning facilitators and Lifetime care staff consider the toolkit of value and enables a flexible approach to planning for integrated care. My Plan has changed the focus of planning away from a therapy directed planning process to a person-centred approach to goal setting and supports. A total of 853 participants were supported and completed a My Plan completed and a total of 1,381 My Plans were received by icare lifetime care. Co mments on transferability: My Plan is used with participants of all ages, injury types, locations, severities and duration post injury. Future work involves using My Plan with people catastrophically injured at work and others with chronic dust diseases such as mesothelioma through exposure at work. Conclusions (comprising key findings, discussion and lessons learned): The presentation outlines evaluation methods, key findings, trends and emerging implications for stakeholders (including participants, planning facilitators, providers and icare lifetime care). Best practice and holistic integrated care planning is illustrated through examples of plans.

AB  - The paper draws on data from a Norwegian online discussion list for back pain sufferers and from open, in-depth interviews with Norwegian back pain sufferers. In both sources, back pain sufferers express a fear that the reality of their pain is being questioned. The paper discusses how these experiences of delegitimation can be understood as a result of the back pain sufferers' inability to achieve the sick role. Many of these individuals strive and frequently fail to achieve clinical and social characteristics that make up appropriate sickness behaviour. A lack of proof that they are sick, including a lack of medical diagnosis, appropriate health care treatment, and visible disabilities, can lead to accusations, both felt and enacted, of malingering, hypochondria and/or mental illness. This in turn can lead to problems in the achievement and/or legitimisation of sick role benefits such as sick leave and medication. The sick role concept has been criticised as being inappropriate for describing the experiences of the chronically ill. The paper argues that the sick role concept still appears to reflect the expectations of health professionals, the public and the patient himself. The study does not support the view that chronic illness is related to a decreased dependency on the medical profession. Instead, doctors' inability to offer chronic back pain sufferers a clear diagnosis, explanation, and/or a course of treatment or cure appears not to liberate the patient but rather prolongs his or her dependence on the doctor.

AB  - Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) is a common condition cancer survivors experience. Mindfulness training may be one approach to address the psychosocial factors associated with CNP. The purpose of this study was to understand patients’ experiences in an 8-week online mindfulness-based program (MBP), including techniques and skills learned and applied, barriers to practice, and research experiences. Nineteen participants who were part of a randomized controlled trial consented to participate in a telephone interview or submit written responses via email post-course. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using the principles of Applied Thematic Analysis (ATA). Predominant themes identified in participant interviews included (1) common humanity, (2) convenience, (3) teacher resonance, (4) perceived relaxation and calm, (5) pain and stress management, (6) half-day session, and (7) mindful breathing. Participants also identified helpful strategies learned and implemented from the course, as well as barriers to practice, and key components of their experiences in a randomized controlled trial, including a sense of disconnection post-course and needing continued ongoing sessions, and the importance of the facilitators’ skills in creating a comfortable and supportive space. An online group-based MBP may offer a more accessible resource and form of psychosocial intervention and support for cancer survivors living with CNP. Furthermore, the need and consideration for implementing ongoing group maintenance sessions to minimize participants’ feelings of disconnect and abandonment post-course and post-study are warranted in future MBP development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a prevalent and debilitating condition that affects the health and quality of life of older adults. Older people often consult primary care physicians about back pain, with many also receiving concurrent care from complementary and alternative medicine providers, most commonly doctors of chiropractic. However, a collaborative model of treatment coordination between these two provider groups has yet to be tested. The primary aim of the Collaborative Care for Older Adults Clinical Trial is to develop and evaluate the clinical effectiveness and feasibility of a patient-centered, collaborative care model with family medicine physicians and doctors of chiropractic for the treatment of low back pain in older adults. METHODS/DESIGN: This pragmatic, pilot randomized controlled trial will enroll 120 participants, age 65 years or older with subacute or chronic low back pain lasting at least one month, from a community-based sample in the Quad-Cities, Iowa/Illinois, USA. Eligible participants are allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 12 weeks of medical care, concurrent medical and chiropractic care, or collaborative medical and chiropractic care. Primary outcomes are self-rated back pain and disability. Secondary outcomes include general and functional health status, symptom bothersomeness, expectations for treatment effectiveness and improvement, fear avoidance behaviors, depression, anxiety, satisfaction, medication use and health care utilization. Treatment safety and adverse events also are monitored. Participant -rated outcome measures are collected via self-reported questionnaires and computer-assisted telephone interviews at baseline, and at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks post-randomization. Provider-rated expectations for treatment effectiveness and participant improvement also are evaluated. Process outcomes are assessed through qualitative interviews with study participants and research clinicians, chart audits of progress notes and content analysis of clinical trial notes. DISCUSSION: This pragmatic, pilot randomized controlled trial uses a mixed method approach to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, feasibility, and participant and provider perceptions of collaborative care between medical doctors and doctors of chiropractic in the treatment of older adults with low back pain.

AB  - Comorbidity is a growing challenge and the older adult population is most at risk of developing comorbid conditions. Comorbidity is associated with increased risk of mortality, increased hospitalizations, increased doctor visits, increased prescription medications, nursing home placement, poorer mental health, and physical disability. American Indians experience some of the highest rates of chronic conditions, but to date there have been only two published studies on the subject of comorbidity in this population. With a community-based sample of 505 American Indians aged 55 years or older, this study identified the most prevalent chronic conditions, described comorbidity, and identified socio-demographic, functional limitations, and psychosocial correlates of comorbidity. Results indicated that older American Indians experience higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, back pain, and vision loss compared to national statistics of older adults. Two-thirds of the sample experienced some degree of comorbidity according to the scale used. Older age, poorer physical functioning, more depressive symptomatology, and lower personal mastery were all correlates of higher comorbidity scores. Despite medical advances increasing life expectancy, morbidity and mortality statistics suggest that the health of older American Indians lags behind the majority population. These findings highlight the importance of supporting chronic care and management services for the older American Indian population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are two general frameworks that conceptualize pain that is more intense or persistent than expected based on measurable pathologic findings: the psychological (unhelpful thoughts and emotions) and the physiological (purported nervous system dysfunction, such as central sensitization). Some clinicians believe people will be more receptive to a physiological conceptualization. Prior quantitative research demonstrated that carefully crafted psychological explanations are rated similarly to crafted physiological explanations, with relatively mixed reactions. This qualitative study was undertaken in parallel with that quantitative study to help develop effective communication and treatment strategies by identifying specific thoughts and feelings (themes) regarding the physiological and psychological conceptualizations of disproportionate pain that make people more or less comfortable considering comprehensive, biopsychosocial treatment approaches. QUESTION/PURPOSE: What themes arise in patient thoughts and feelings regarding physiological and psychological conceptualizations of pain that is more intense or persistent than expected? METHODS: We sought to understand the experience of considering pain as a biopsychosocial experience (phenomenology approach) by studying the thoughts and feelings that arise as people seeking care for arm and back pain engage with physiological and psychological conceptualizations of pain that is more intense or persistent than one would expect based on the pathology. We recruited 29 patients presenting for upper extremity or back pain specialty care at one of two urban offices, intentionally recruiting people of various ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic status, as well as type and duration of pain (purposive sampling). The 29 patients included 18 women and 11 men (16 married, 15 non-White, 20 with arm pain) with a median (interquartile range) age of 62 years (42 to 67). The interviews were conducted by a trained woman orthopaedic surgeon interviewer using a semistructured interview guide soliciting participants' thoughts and feelings about a physiological explanation (nerves in the central nervous system stuck in the on position can make pain more intense) and a psychological explanation (unhelpful thoughts and feelings of distress can make pain more intense) for pain more intense or persistent than expected. The interviews were transcribed and themes were identified as the data were collected. Based on current experimental evidence, including what is known about the physiological effects of thoughts, feelings, and context (placebo/nocebo effects), we assumed an underlying physiological basis for pain that is variably experienced and expressed (mixed postpositive/interpretive approach). Themes were identified in the interview transcripts systematically by two coders and then discussed with the entire research team to arrive at consensus. We stopped enrolling patients when the authors agreed that additional themes did not arise in five consecutive interviews. RESULTS: The following themes and interpretations were derived from the analysis: Neither the physiological nor the psychological explanation for disproportionate pain (1) avoided the stigma associated with mental health, (2) was consistently understood, (3) provided a consistent sense of control, (4) consistently provided hope, and (5) represented the stress and emotion of disproportionate or persistent pain. The physiological explanation also generated mixed reactions regarding whether or not it: (1) was a useful point of conversation, (2) was reassuring or frightening, and (3) supported physiological or psychological treatments. The psychological explanation made some people feel worse. CONCLUSION: People have mixed reactions to both physiological and psychological explanations of disproportionate pain. As such, without direction on content, communication might be most effective by focusing on relational aspects, such as emotional connection and trust. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although there is room to improve the content of strategies for explaining more pain than expected to patients, our findings extend the discoveries of others in highlighting the need for tailored relational communication strategies that prioritize feeling heard, validated, and accompanied.

AB  - One of the major challenges for general practitioners is to manage individuals with acute low back pain appropriately to reduce the risk of chronicity. A prospective study was designed to assess the actual management of acute low back pain in one primary care setting and to determine whether existing practice patterns conform to published guidelines. Twenty-four family physicians from public primary care centers of the Basque Health Service in Bizkaia, Basque Country (Spain), participated in the study. A total of 105 patients aged 18-65 years presenting with acute low back pain over a 6-month period were included. Immediately after consultation, a research assistant performed a structured clinical interview. The patients' care provided by the general practitioner was compared with the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) guidelines and guidelines issued by the Royal College of General Practitioners. The diagnostic process showed a low rate of appropriate use of history (27%), physical examination (32%), lumbar radiographs (31%), and referral to specialized care (33%). Although the therapeutic process showed a relatively high rate of appropriateness in earlier mobilization (77%) and educational advice (65%), only 23% of patients were taught about the benign course of back pain. The study revealed that management of acute low back pain in the primary care setting is far from being in conformance with published clinical guidelines.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate outcome predictors of short- and medium-term therapeutic efficacy of facet joint blocks. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with chronic lower back pain who were undergoing facet joint blocks at one (n = 29) or two (n = 13) levels were analyzed. All patients underwent MRI or CT of the lumbar spine within 5 months before the facet joint blocks. The facet joint blocks were performed under fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount (< 0.3 mL) of iodinated contrast agent, 0.5 mL of local anesthetics and 0.5 mL of steroids, were injected. The initial pain response was prospectively assessed using a visual analogue scale. Additional data, including short-term effect (> 1 week) and medium-term effect (> 3 months), were collected by a structured telephone interview. CT and MRI were reviewed with regard to the extent of facet joint abnormalities. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify outcome predictor for efficacy of facet joint blocks. RESULTS: A positive immediate effect was seen in 31 patients (74%). A positive medium-term effect was found in 14 patients (33%). Pain alleviated by motion (p = 0.035) and the absence of joint-blocking sensation (p = 0.042) predicted pain relief. However, the extent of facet joint osteoarthritis on MRI and CT was not a significant predictor for outcome (p = 0.57-0.95). CONCLUSION: Facet joint blocks appear to have a beneficial medium-term effect in one third of patients with chronic lower back pain and may therefore be a reasonable adjunct to nonoperative treatment. However, outcome appears to depend on clinical, not on morphologic, imaging findings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Due to the difficulties encountered in the treatment process of patients with chronic pain, it is of utmost importance to involve patients themselves in their rehabilitation trajectory. Patient engagement can be obtained by motivating patients to select their own treatment goals. We hypothesize that applying goal setting, as a form of patient empowerment, in potential candidates for spinal cord stimulation (SCS) may further improve the outcome of SCS. As a first step in creating patient empowerment, patients' goals that they aim to achieve with SCS will be explored. METHODS: Fifteen patients suffering from failed back/neck surgery syndrome and scheduled for SCS were interviewed in depth. All interviews were audio recorded and analyzed using in vivo coding. Afterwards, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework was used to structure the responses of patients. RESULTS: In the domain of bodily functions, all patients mentioned pain reduction, and 1 patient wanted to regain his previous sleep pattern. In the domain of activities, walking, sitting, driving a car, bending down, and picking up were the highest ranked goals. Regaining a social life was the highest ranked goal for participation. Eleven patients wanted to regain a feeling of happiness, and 5 patients wanted to focus on avoiding depression. CONCLUSION: The interviews revealed a broad spectrum of individual patients' goals, highlighting the need of individually targeted rehabilitation trajectories in the field of neuromodulation. Goal identification could entail the first step towards individualized medicine in the SCS trajectory.

AB  - Daily diary methodology was used to examine within- and between-person associations among pain appraisals, coping strategies, personal characteristics, perceived spousal responses and daily (30 days) changes in negative mood and pain for 88 women with chronic back pain. Multilevel models revealed that control appraisals and distraction and ignoring pain coping strategies were associated with same-day reductions in negative mood and pain; whereas catastrophizing appraisals and praying and hoping coping strategies were associated with an increase in negative mood or pain. With appraisals and coping controlled for, average within-day decreases in depression were associated with perceived control in one's life; increases in anxiety were associated with spousal distracting responses; and increases in pain intensity were associated with spousal punishing responses and pain interference.

AB  - <b>Introduction:</b> The objective of this study was to understand the experiences of nonpharmacologic therapy (NPT) providers implementing the Oregon Back Pain Policy (OBPP). The Medicaid OBPP expanded coverage of evidence-based NPTs for back pain and simultaneously restricted access to acute and chronic opioid therapy and some interventional approaches for chronic back pain. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This study uses a cross-sectional, observational design. The authors conducted three online focus groups with 44 credentialed NPT providers in February 2020. Qualitative data analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team with an immersion/crystallization approach. <b>Results:</b> Four themes emerged from the data. Participants reported: (1) a lack of direct communication about the policy and mixed levels of understanding of the policy, (2) belief that expanding access to NPT and restricting opioids was beneficial for patients, (3) implementation challenges that compromised access and the perceived effectiveness of care, and (4) financial challenges in accepting Medicaid referrals, due to reimbursement and administrative burden. <b>Conclusion: </b> The goal of the OBPP was to increase access to evidence-based back pain care, including new coverage of NPT services and decreased opioid prescribing for back pain. This study revealed that although many NPT providers support the goals of this policy, the policy was not communicated systematically to providers and was hampered by implementation challenges.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To make a qualitative analysis of the expectations of chronic low back pain (LBP) sufferers with regard to information gained using semi-directed Internet navigation on a sample of French LBP-related websites, and to compare the results with those of physical medicine and rehabilitation (PMR) medical doctors (MD). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-seven hospitalised chronic LBP sufferers assessed in ecological conditions a sample of seven LBP-related websites. The sites were assessed using a simplified version of a rating scale of patients' expectations. Analysis of the relative importance of the different kinds of information delivered was done using a point sharing method. RESULTS: In a comfortable environment, patients gave high scores for medical and extra-medical information, but low scores for website design. Overall quality assessment was similar for patients and MDs. The relative importance of medical and extra-medical information, and design quality, was similar for Chronic LBP patients and MDs. CONCLUSION: PMR MD seemed able to correctly evaluate the overall expectations of chronic LBP patients with regard to information, but their opinions on the different qualities of websites were different. Doctors and patients should collaborate in order to create or validate high quality websites concerned with LBP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pain numerical rating scale (NRS) is widely used in pain research and clinical settings to represent pain intensity. For an individual with chronic pain, NRS reporting requires representation of a complex subjective state as a numeral. To evaluate the process of NRS reporting, this study examined the relationship between reported pain NRS levels and imagined painful events reported by study subjects. DESIGN: A total of 149 subjects with chronic low back pain characterized by the NIH Research Task Force Recommended Minimal Dataset reported current pain NRS and provided imagined examples of painful experiences also attributing to these an NRS. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the 797 pain examples provided by the study subjects. RESULTS: Study subjects tended to be able to imagine both highly painful 10/10 events and non-painful events with relative agreement across subjects. While NRS for the pain examples tended to increase with example severity, for many types of examples there was wide dispersion around the mean pain level. Examination of pain examples indicated unexpected relationships between current pain and the intensity and nature of the imagined painful events. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the pain NRS does not provide a reliably interpretable assessment of current physical pain intensity for an individual with chronic pain at a specific moment.

AB  - We aim to answer the question: How can we develop an evidence base that will assist tailoring health interventions to individual patients? Using social theory and interview data from people living with chronic illness, we developed a new approach to analysis. Individuals were considered as emergent complex systems, adjusting and adapting within their environment and sometimes transforming. The notion of illness trajectory brought our attention to data in the interviews about the "emergent present," the current period of time when all domains of life, from across time, have expression. We summarized patterns of adjustment and adaptation within the emergent present for people living with chronic back pain, depression, and diabetes. We considered the potential of this analysis approach to inform medical decision making. Our analysis approach is the first step in developing a categorization of individuals that might be useful in tailoring health care interventions to the individual.

AB  - RATIONALE AND AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: When assessing patients, clinicians use typologies developed through their own particular clinical experience. Our aim was to develop a typology, based on the patient's perspective and not specific to one illness, with the potential to enhance person-centred clinical follow-up of those living with chronic illness. METHODS: We applied the qualitative comparative method of analysis to interview data from 37 people living with type 2 diabetes or with chronic back pain, recruited from UK General Practices. Informed by theory on time and complexity, analysis focused on the ongoing adjustments made by individuals living with chronic illness (their dynamic) in current time. Health professionals (n = 20) and people living with diabetes or living with back pain (n = 14) refined and validated the typology in five focus groups. RESULTS: We identified the following types of dynamic: past reminders, stuck and struggling, becalmed, and submerged. Among interviewees who provided data at different time points, we found some transformed from one dynamic type to another. CONCLUSION: This typology may aid personalization of treatment decisions and could be extended to other chronic illness.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A mobile application has the potential to involve people with chronic NSLBP in their rehabilitation. To refine the design of a smartphone application for people with chronic NSLBP using mixed quantitative and qualitative approaches. METHODS: We used a user-centred design approach involving people with chronic NSLBP and healthcare professionals (HCPs). We used a three-step methodology: developing consensus on the features, content, and design of the app; developing a user interface; and usability testing of the app and assessing users' experience. Transcripts of interviews of users were analyzed by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 18 people (aged 45 [23-53] years old) with chronic NSLBP, and 7 HCPs (aged 29.5 [25-55] years old) involved in NSLBP management were interviewed. The overall experience of using the smartphone eLombactif app was initially assessed. Then, with close-ended questions we evaluated users' judgements on the content, its presentation and navigation. Finally, we asked for suggestions: "application content and functionality" and "content presentation" from participants regarding the use and development of the app analyzed by a qualitative methodology. CONCLUSIONS: This study described how we refined the design of our application for people with chronic NSLBP using a qualitative and quantitative approaches. This methodology allows for deepening the knowledge of the needs and expectations of potential users by measuring their user experience.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONNon-specific low back pain (NSLBP) is a major global public health issue leading to considerable economic cost and is primarily responsible for pain and disability.Mobile application has the potential to involve people with chronic NSLBP in their rehabilitation. This study described how we refined the design of our application for people with chronic NSLBP using a qualitative and quantitative approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between work-related recovery expectations and return-to-work in patients with chronic back pain. METHODS: A prospective cohort of workers receiving time-loss benefits for back pain of at least 6 weeks' duration was studied. Workers completed a battery of measures, including a work-related recovery expectations questionnaire. Outcomes included surrogate indicators of timely return-to-work (days until suspension of time-loss benefits) and recovery (claim closure) censored at 1 year. Analysis included multivariable Cox and logistic regression. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly male (63%), with a mean age of 42 years. Positive work-related recovery expectations predicted a 26% faster suspension of time-loss benefits (95% confidence interval = 8-40%) and explained 7% of the variation in this outcome. CONCLUSION: Recovery expectations provide important information for predicting time to return-to-work, as measured through suspension of time-loss benefits (R approximately 7%) in patients with chronic back pain.

AB  - Background\r\nPatients with progressive kidney disease experience increasing physiologic and psychosocial stressors and declining health-related quality of life (HRQOL).\r\nMethods\r\nWe conducted a randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial to test whether a Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program delivered in a novel workshop-teleconference format would reduce symptoms and improve HRQOL in patients awaiting kidney transplantation. Sixty-three transplant candidates were randomized to one of two arms: i) telephone-adapted MBSR (tMBSR, an 8-week program of meditation and yoga); or ii) a telephone-based support group (tSupport). Participants completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention, and after 6-months. Anxiety, measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) post-intervention served as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included: depression, sleep quality, pain, fatigue, and HRQOL assessed by SF-12 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS).\r\nResults\r\n55 patients (age 54 ± 12 yrs) attended their assigned program (tMBSR, n = 27; tSupport, n = 28). 49% of patients had elevated anxiety at baseline. Changes in anxiety were small and did not differ by treatment group post-intervention or at follow-up. However, tMBSR significantly improved mental HRQOL at follow-up: + 6.2 points on the MCS - twice the minimum clinically important difference (95% CI: 1.66 to 10.8, P = 0.01). A large percentage of tMBSR participants (≥ 90%) practiced mindfulness and reported it helpful for stress management.\r\nConclusions\r\nNeither mindfulness training nor a support group resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in anxiety. In contrast, finding that tMBSR was more effective than tSupport for bolstering mental HRQOL during the wait for a kidney transplant is encouraging and warrants further investigation.\r\n\r\nClinicalTrials.govNCT01254214.

AB  - <b>Context:</b> People with spinal cord injury and dysfunction (SCI/D) often take multiple medications (i.e. polypharmacy) to manage secondary health complications and multiple chronic conditions. Numerous healthcare providers are often involved in clinical care, increasing the risk of fragmented care, problematic polypharmacy, and conflicting health advice. These providers can play a crucial role in assisting patients with medication self-management to improve medication adherence. <b>Design:</b> A qualitative study involving telephone interviews, following a semi-structured guide that explored healthcare providers' conceptualization of factors impacting medication adherence for persons with SCI/D. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed descriptively and interpretively using a constant comparative process with the assistance of data display matrices. Analysis was guided by an ecological model of medication adherence. <b>Setting and participants:</b> Thirty-two healthcare providers from Canada, with varying clinical expertise. <b>Intervention:</b> Not Applicable. <b>Outcome measures:</b> Not Applicable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persons with spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) often take multiple medications to treat their secondary complications and chronic conditions (multimorbidity). Multiple healthcare and service providers are often involved in care, which can result in increased risk of fragmentation of care. Optimal medication therapy management (MTM) is essential to ensure therapeutic benefit from medication regimens. However, little is known about the experiences of providers in supporting persons with SCI/D with MTM. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted to explore healthcare and service providers' experiences with MTM for persons with SCI/D. Participants were recruited through clinical organizations and researchers' personal contacts. Participants were purposefully selected for diversity in profession and were required to be English speaking and to have provided care to at least one person with SCI/D. The qualitative interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide. Data display matrices were used in a constant comparative process for descriptive and interpretive analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-two interviews were conducted from April to December 2018. Each profession had distinct views on their roles in facilitating MTM for persons with SCI/D, which aligned with their respective scopes of practice. Shared provider tasks included tailoring medications, providing education, and exploring medication alternatives. Most participants felt that the care they provided for persons with SCI/D was similar to the care that they provided to other patients, with some differences relating to the physical limitations and medical complexity associated with SCI/D. Five factors were identified that impacted participants' abilities to provide MTM for persons with SCI/D: patient self-management skills, provider knowledge and confidence, provider-patient relationships, interprofessional collaboration, and provider funding models including the use of technology-supported consultations. CONCLUSION: While participants described commonalities in the barriers and enablers associated with providing MTM to persons with SCI/D and other populations, there were unique considerations identified. These SCI/D-specific considerations resulted in recommendations for improvements in MTM for this population. Future research should include perspectives from persons with SCI/D.

AB  - Limits on health care resources mean that resource allocation decisions should be guided by considerations of cost in relation to benefits. A method of economic evaluation, (cost-utility analysis) was used to evaluate the costs and benefits of a physiotherapy outpatient department. The quality of life of 56 patients was measured before and after physiotherapy intervention and the costs of the treatment compared with the benefits gained. Within the limitations of the study, physiotherapy was found to be good value for money compared with other health care interventions, with treatment for chronic conditions such as back pain, neck pain and osteoarthritis representing better value for money than treatment for acute conditions such as strains and sprains and fractures.

AB  - Formal youth mentoring is an effective intervention strategy for healthy development during adolescence. Modest and varied effects across programs, however, demonstrate a need to identify factors that can reliably improve outcomes for mentored youth. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to test the relative impact of embedding mentee-mentor matches in small groups on youth outcomes and to examine whether this effect was mediated by the quality of the program setting and mentoring relationship quality. Participants included 676 adolescents (Mage = 14.21, range = 11–18; 41.6% female) enrolled in Campus Connections, a site-based youth mentoring program. Most measured outcomes in both conditions (i.e., mentoring groups and a control condition in which pairs were not embedded in a group) were significantly better at post-intervention as compared to pre-intervention. The hypothesis that mentoring groups would have stronger impact, however, was not supported. The results imply that organizing mentor-mentee matches in small groups offer no advantage or disadvantage and that youth may be able to garner benefit from both structures.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate long-term clinical and economical effects of a light mobilization program on the duration of sick leave for patients with subacute low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Twelve-month follow-up results from a previous study showed that early intervention with examination at a spine clinic, giving the patients information, reassurance, and encouragement to engage in physical activity as normal as possible had significant effect in reducing sick leave. At 12-month follow-up, 68.4% in the intervention group were off sick leave, as compared with 56.4% in the control group. Patients in this study were followed-up for a period of 3 years to investigate possible long-term effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-seven patients placed on a sick list for 8 to 12 weeks for low back pain were randomized into two groups: an intervention group (n = 237) and a control group (n = 220). The intervention group was examined at a spine clinic and given information and advice to stay active. The control group was not examined at the clinic but was treated within the primary health care. RESULTS: Over the 3 years of observation, the intervention group had significantly fewer days of sickness compensation (average 125.7 d/person) than the control group (169.6 d/person). This difference is mainly caused by a more rapid return to work during the first year. There was no significant difference for the second or third year. In particular, there is no increased risk for reoccurrence of illness from early return to work. At 6-month follow-up, patients in the intervention group were less likely to use bed rest and more likely to use stretching and walking to cope with their back pain compared with the control group. This effect diminished. At 12-month follow-up, the only significant difference between the groups was in the use of stretching. Economic returns of the intervention were calculated in terms of increases in the net present value of production for the society because of the reduction in number of days on sick leave. Net benefits accumulated over 3 years of treating the 237 patients in the intervention group amount to approximately 2,822 dollars per person. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with subacute low back pain, a brief and simple early intervention with examination, information, reassurance, and encouragement to engage in physical activity as normal as possible had economic gains for the society. The effect occurred during the first year after intervention. There were no significant long-term effects of the intervention. The initial gain obtained during the first year does not lead to any increased costs or increased risks for reoccurrence of illness over the next 2 years.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate sex differences in predicting chronicity of low-back pain after acute trauma using cross-sectional areas of paraspinal (multifidus and erector spinae) and psoas muscles. Design: Between January 2 00 6 and December 2010, a total of 54 patients were interviewed at least 6 mos after the trauma event. The subjects were classified into chronic low-back pain group and improved low-back pain group according to the presence of low-back pain for more than 6 mos. The cross-sectional area of the multifidus, erector spinae, and psoas muscles was measured at the level of the lower margin of the L3 and L5 vertebrae using magnetic resonance imaging. Results: The cross-sectional area of the multifidus and erector spinae muscles at L5 in the chronic low-back pain group was significantly smaller than that of the improved low-back pain group (P < 0.05) in the men. There were no significant differences in the other parameters between the groups in the men. There were no significant differences in any parameters in the women. Conclusions: In the men, the cross-sectional area of the multifidus and erector spinae muscles at the lower lumbar level can be considered to be prognostic factors for the chronic low-back pain after acute trauma. The authors thus suggest that strengthening of lumbar paraspinal muscles could be helpful for preventing chronicity of low-back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient engagement in decisions regarding their health care may lead to improved outcomes and improved adherence to treatment plans. While there are several options for involving patients in their health care, goal setting is a readily accessible method for physical therapists to increase the involvement of patients in health care decisions. Physical therapy goals are often generated by health care providers based on subjective information or standardized, fixed-item, patient-reported outcome measures. However, these outcome measures may not fully reveal the activity and participation limitations of individual patients. Goal attainment scaling (GAS) is a patient-centered approach that allows patients to set meaningful goals. While GAS has been shown to be reliable, valid, and sensitive to change in various populations, there is limited evidence in the United States on utilizing GAS in physical therapy for patients with chronic low back pain (LBP). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol for a study to (1) develop a way to apply GAS procedures for physical therapists treating patients with chronic LBP in the United States and (2) test the feasibility of applying GAS procedures for chronic LBP in an outpatient physical therapy setting. METHODS: This study used a mixed methods design with 2 phases: qualitative and quantitative. The qualitative phase of the study employed focus groups of patients with chronic LBP to identify an inventory of goals that were important and measurable. A series of prompts was developed from this inventory to assist physical therapists in collaboratively establishing goals with patients in a clinical setting. The quantitative phase of the study pilot-tested the inventory developed in the qualitative phase in patients with chronic LBP to determine feasibility, reliability, validity, and responsiveness. We also plan to compare how well GAS reveals change over time relative to traditional, fixed-item, patient-reported measures. RESULTS: Phase 1 data collection was completed in June 2020, while data collection for phase 2 was performed between March 2021 and December 2021. We anticipate that this study will demonstrate that GAS can be implemented successfully by outpatient physical therapists, and that it will demonstrate clinically important changes in patients with chronic LBP. CONCLUSIONS: GAS represents an opportunity for patient-centered care in the physical therapy management of chronic LBP. While GAS is not new, it has never been studied in real-world physical therapy for chronic LBP in a clinical setting. Due to unique time and productivity constraints, for GAS to be successfully implemented in this environment, we must demonstrate that clinicians can be trained efficiently and reliably, that GAS can be implemented in a clinical setting in under 15 minutes, and that GAS is able to detect clinically meaningful changes in patient outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of tai chi exercise on persistent low back pain. METHODS: We performed a randomized controlled trial in a general community setting in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Participants consisted of 160 volunteers between ages 18 and 70 years with persistent nonspecific low back pain. The tai chi group (n = 80) consisted of 18 40-minute sessions over a 10-week period delivered in a group format by a qualified instructor. The waitlist control group continued with their usual health care. Bothersomeness of back symptoms was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included pain intensity and pain-related disability. Data were collected at pre- and postintervention and analyzed by intent-to-treat. RESULTS: Tai chi exercise reduced bothersomeness of back symptoms by 1.7 points on a 0-10 scale, reduced pain intensity by 1.3 points on a 0-10 scale, and improved self-report disability by 2.6 points on the 0-24 Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scale. The followup rate was >90% for all outcomes. These results were considered a worthwhile treatment effect by researchers and participants. CONCLUSION: This is the first pragmatic randomized controlled trial of tai chi exercise for people with low back pain. It showed that a 10-week tai chi program improved pain and disability outcomes and can be considered a safe and effective intervention for those experiencing long-term low back pain symptoms.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine current physiotherapy practice for managing chronic low back pain (LBP). Method: We administered a cross-sectional survey to all physiotherapists working in Eastern Health (EH) Regional Health Authority, Newfoundland and Labrador, by email. To ascertain how physiotherapists assessed and treated patients with LBP, the survey included multiple-choice and open-ended questions, along with case vignettes. We explored the respondents' confidence about implementing all aspects of guideline-based care, as well as their use of treatment outcome measures. Results: A total of 76 physiotherapists responded to the survey (84% response rate); 56 (74%) reported that they treated patients with LBP as part of their regular practice. More than half had managed LBP for more than 10 years. The most frequently used treatments were self-management advice, followed by home and supervised exercise. The majority of respondents lacked confidence about implementing cognitive–behavioural treatment techniques. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale was the most commonly used outcome measure; disability outcome measures were not frequently used. Conclusions: The majority of LBP management in EH aligns with guideline recommendations. Increased uptake of guidelines recommending assessment and management of LBP using a bio-psychosocial approach will require training and support. Objectif : déterminer les pratiques de physiothérapie actuelles pour traiter les douleurs lombaires chroniques. Méthodologie : les chercheurs ont distribué un sondage transversal par courriel à tous les physiothérapeutes de l'Autorité régionale de la santé de l'Est (SE) de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador. Pour déterminer la manière dont les physiothérapeutes évaluent et traitent les patients ayant des douleurs lombaires, le sondage incluait des questions à choix multiples, des questions ouvertes et des scénarios de cas. Les chercheurs ont exploré la confiance des répondants envers l'adoption de tous les aspects des soins reposant sur des directives, de même qu'envers les mesures de résultat des traitements. Résultats : au total, 76 physiothérapeutes ont répondu au sondage, pour un taux de réponse de 84 %; 56 (74 %) ont déclaré traiter des patients ayant des douleurs lombaires dans le cadre de leur pratique régulière. Plus de la moitié traitaient des douleurs lombaires depuis plus de dix ans. Les traitements les plus utilisés étaient des conseils d'autogestion, suivis par des exercices à domicile et des exercices supervisés. La majorité des répondants n'avaient pas assez confiance pour adopter des techniques de thérapie cognitivo-comportementale. L'échelle numérique d'évaluation de la douleur était la mesure de résultat la plus utilisée, tandis que les mesures de résultats des incapacités étaient peu utilisées. Conclusion : à la SE, le traitement de la majorité des douleurs lombaires est conforme aux directives. Pour accroître les mises à jour des directives recommandant d'évaluer et de traiter les douleurs lombaires au moyen d'une approche biopsychosociale, il faudra une formation et un soutien.

AB  - Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a potentially debilitating chronic condition that necessitates a biopsychosocial approach for successful long-term management. However, the psychosocial consequences of AS are not well understood. In this study patients (N = 68) reported impacts of AS across a wide range of life domains; negative impacts included physical effects of AS, changes in mood or personality, effects on social life and relationships with friends and family, low self-esteem, stigma and worry about the future; positive impacts included increased exercise, feelings of achievement and empathy, stronger relationships, slower pace of life and a more positive perspective. Implications for treatment are discussed. Copyright © 2009 SAGE Publications Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical outcomes of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) therapy in patients with a Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) is mostly done by standardized pain and quality of life measurements instruments and hardly account for personal feelings and needs as a basis for a patient-centred approach and shared decision making. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to explore perspectives on personal health and quality of life (QoL) in FBSS patients concerning their physical-, psychological and spiritual well-being prior to receiving an SCS system. METHODS: We performed face-to-face, semi-structured, in-depth interviews to obtain descriptive and detailed data on personal health, guided by the Web diagram of Positive Health (Huber et al.) and a topic list. The following main topics were assessed qualitatively: 1) Bodily functioning, 2) Mental function and perception 3) Spiritual dimension, 4) Quality of life, 5) Social and societal participation and 6) Daily functioning. RESULTS: Seventeen FBSS patients (eight male, nine female) were included from April-November 2019 at the department of pain medicine in the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in the Netherlands. Median age 49 years; range 28 to 67 years, and patients underwent between one and five lumbar surgical operations. The duration of their chronic pain was between four and 22 years. After analyzing the interviews, three themes emerged: 1) dealing with chronic pain, 2) the current situation regarding aspects of positive health, and 3) future perspectives on health and quality of life. These themes arose from eleven categories and a hundred ninety codes. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study explored FBSS patients 'views on their health and the ability to adapt to daily life having complex chronic pain, and showed that patients experienced shortcomings in daily life within the six dimensions of the Web diagram of Positive Health before the SCS implant.

AB  - Background: This case series describes, for the first time, to the author's knowledge, a novel treatment for coccydynia. Tarsal tunnel block with lignocaine only brought relief of chronic coccydynia lasting more than 6 months in three patients. The author adopts the theory that the myelin sheath of the posterior tibial nerve will convey the lipid-soluble lignocaine upward toward the dorsal root ganglia and the nerve roots of the lumbar spine through the uninterrupted myelin sheath, which is itself mainly formed of lipids. The author thinks that most coccyx pain is actually a radiating pain from the lumbar spine, which is not always apparent on magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine. Certainly, the author acknowledges that large-scale studies need to be done to prove the efficacy of this new technique and to prove that the myelin sheath can convey the lignocaine chemical upward.Case Presentation: Three Arab patients presented with chronic coccydynia of more than 6 months' duration in whom conservative management had failed to control their symptoms. They had no past medical history of significance and no history of trauma. The results of physical examination of all of the patients were normal apart from tenderness on palpation of the coccyx. They all received local coccyx injection with steroids on two occasions, which failed to relieve their pain. One patient underwent manipulation under anesthesia, and one underwent coccygectomy with no pain relief. Magnetic resonance imaging results were reported to be normal in two of them, whereas the other one had a prolapsed disc at the L4/L5 level. The three patients described pain relief 30 minutes after tarsal tunnel block with lignocaine only lasting more than 6 months. All patients had heel anesthesia 15 minutes after the tarsal tunnel injection, which lasted only 1 hour.Conclusions: Tarsal tunnel block with lignocaine can relieve coccyx pain for a long time. Tarsal tunnel block can be done to achieve heel anesthesia before injection of lignocaine into the plantar fascia in patients with plantar fasciitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common and often difficult to treat condition in the primary care setting. Research involving in-depth exploration on the views and experiences faced by primary care doctors in managing patients with CLBP in Malaysia is limited. OBJECTIVE: To explore the primary care practitioners' views and experiences in managing patients with CLBP. STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative approach was employed using focus group discussions (FGD) at an academic primary care clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Twenty-three primary care doctors were purposively selected. Data were collected through audio-recorded interviews, which were transcribed verbatim and checked for accuracy. Data saturation was reached by the third FGD. An additional FGD was included to ensure completeness. A thematic approach using the one sheet of paper (OSOP) method was used to analyse the data. RESULTS: Participants view managing patients with CLBP as challenging. This is mainly due to the difficulty in balancing the doctors' expectations with the patients' perceived expectations during consultation. Barriers identified include lack of awareness and conflicting views regarding the usefulness of the local clinical practice guideline (CPG) in clinical practice. Other barriers include time constraints and perceived lack of support from multidisciplinary teams in managing these patients. CONCLUSION: Managing patients with CLBP is still a challenge for Malaysian primary care doctors. Any intervention should target identified barriers to improve the management of patients with CLBP.

AB  - Purpose: The formal processes of clinical guideline development have produced many examples of 'best practices' in health care delivery. Several have emerged on the topic of back pain. This article strives to summarize and place in context an effort by the New Zealand Guidelines Group on the use and impact of psychosocial 'Yellow Flags' on health care practices managing acute and chronic low back pain. Methodology: A qualitative review of literature in textbooks and refereed literature on psychosocial risk factors for chronicity and prolonged disability in the care of low back pain and on the effect of guidelines and practice aids in the implementation of guidelines. Critical review of the New Zealand Guidelines Group product, Guide to Assessing Psychosocial Yellow Flags in Acute Low Back Pain: Risk Factors for Long-Term Disability and Work Loss, was performed. Summary: Important clinical management strategies for assessing potential risk of chronicity and long-term disability are offered for implementation into clinical decision-making processes. Once identified, patients who are at risk can be monitored according to management strategies to decrease probability of chronicity, enhance return to functional and work status, and positively affect patient pain behaviors. This article also provides some guidance for the practitioner to better manage the acute back pain patient to prevent chronicity and/or prolonged disability. Implicit in this guidance are measures to effect change in patients' and providers' attitudes and behaviors for dealing with a very common patient complaint.

AB  - PURPOSE: To elucidate life lived with recurrent, spine-related pain and to explore the development from work to disability pension. METHOD: A qualitative design at individual level was chosen. Nineteen people--five on disability pension, four physicians and ten rehabilitation officials--were interviewed. Data were analysed using grounded theory. RESULTS: A process of 'coming to terms with pain' with four phases was identified. During the phases pain had a deteriorating course and was combined with other medical problems. Together with changes on the labour market these factors caused the persons to leave their employment and also hindered reorientation on the labour market. Committed as they were to social norms, the persons found adjustment to a place outside the labour market difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest how recurrent back and neck pain can develop, interact with medical, individual, work-related and structural factors and result in incapacity to work. To avoid this incapacity pain has to be followed and the other factors considered in the design and timing of rehabilitation.

AB  - This study is evaluated what patients with rheumatic disease perceive as important in their medical encounters. We interviewed two groups of patients: one with a well-defined inflammatory condition (rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or ankylosing spondylitis) (n = 12) and one with non-inflammatory widespread chronic pain such as fibromyalgia (n = 14). Both groups focused on their relationship to their doctor. Two central themes emerged as of importance: 'to be seen' and 'to be believed'. However, these themes had different connotations for the two groups. For the patients with inflammatory conditions, 'to be seen' implied being seen as an individual and not as a mere diagnosis, and 'to be believed' as far as pain and suffering were concerned. For patients with non-inflammatory chronic pain 'to be seen' and 'to be believed' primarily implied being able to obtain a useful somatic diagnosis. Practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to enhance the understanding of the process that physical therapists undertake when creating and disseminating exercise programs for older adults with chronic backpain. METHODS: Constructivist grounded theory methodology was used as an accessible mode of researching pragmatic clinical practices. Physical therapists from outpatient, ambulatory care clinic settings participated in in-depth, individual interviews (n = 9) and in-clinic observations (n = 5). Data collection and analysis were iterative processes. Codes were generated based on recurrent themes, and constant comparative analysis was used to compare data. Analysis and data collection were concluded when theoretical sufficiency was reached. RESULTS: Physical therapist participants described the process of creating and implementing exercise plans as involving listening to the patient's story, determining function, physical therapy care, supported integration, and, ultimately, returning back to living and life with chronic back pain. Participants worked through the 5 phases at different rates, often recurrently, when treating older adults with chronic back pain. The phases are positioned within a shared alliance between physical therapy provider and patient, with a transfer of responsibility occurring throughout treatment and follow-up sessions, progressing toward patient independence. This transfer of responsibility served as the core category for the process herein. CONCLUSIONS: This research highlights the importance of listening to patients' stories when engaging in physical therapy care. Focusing on function, providing education and exercise as components of care, and supporting integration of exercise into everyday life are considerations for providing care for older adults with chronic back pain in physical therapist practice and, ultimately, for returning tolife. IMPACT: With aging populations and with the increasing prevalence of chronic conditions, this research offers insight into a process for physical therapists to enact exercise engagement for improved health and quality of life for older adults with chronic backpain.

AB  - Patients are experts on their own lives and the ways in which an illness, injury, or disability affects their health, activity, and quality of life. With its longstanding foundations in participatory action research, patient engagement has been gaining momentum across health care and related research. This momentum is supported by investments from several key research and federal policy-related organizations, including the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, and Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Occupational therapy practitioners are uniquely positioned to champion patient collaborations. In this article, we discuss ways in which patient perspectives can be embraced in occupational therapy research, and we share insights from a research planning collaborative with adolescents and young adults that was led by occupational therapy researchers.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To test the ability of an educational pamphlet to improve recovery in terms of pain, work status, and health care utilization after occupational low back injury. BACKGROUND: Low back pain and disability persist as occupational health problems of epidemic proportions. Because interventions based on biomechanical models have had limited impact, recent educational approaches to preventing back problems have stressed psychosocial recovery issues. METHODS: A pamphlet was developed by compiling activity resumption, self-care, and attitudinal advice from recent publications. The pamphlet was sent at random to half of all consenting workers reporting back pain within 11 days of occupational injury between 7/96 and 6/97. Three and 6 months later, back pain, work status, health care use, and pamphlet impact outcomes were assessed through structured telephone interviews. RESULTS: Of the 726 eligible workers, 486 consented to participate. Consenters and nonconsenters and intervention and control groups were similar in initial demographic variables. The pamphlet had no statistically significant impact at the 0.05 significance level on pain severity or reduction, health care visits, or work absence. Of the 229 pamphlet recipients, 129 thought it had provided useful information, but only 25 thought it had helped them return to work more quickly. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, a pamphlet stressing psychosocial recovery issues did not prevent or reduce postinjury pain, health care use, or work absence.

AB  - <b>Objective</b>: Many older adults cope with various chronic physical health conditions, and in some cases, with mental health and/or cognitive difficulties. Mindfulness-based interventions offer an evidence-based, mind-body complementary treatment approach for a wide range of comorbidities, yet most investigations were conducted with young or middle-aged adults. The purpose of this review was to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of two leading mindfulness-based interventions conducted with older adults. <b>Methods</b>: Our search of five databases identified seven RCT investigations of either Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) conducted exclusively with older adults. <b>Results</b>: Results generally supported the use of MBSR for chronic low back pain, chronic insomnia, improved sleep quality, enhanced positive affect, reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, and improved memory and executive functioning. In a sample of older adults exhibiting elevated anxiety in the absence of elevated depression, MBCT effectively reduced symptoms of anxiety. <b>Conclusions</b>: This review highlights the feasibility and possible benefits of MBSR and MBCT for older adults. Additional large scale RCTs conducted with older adults coping with the range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive challenges older adults commonly face still are needed. <b>Clinical Implications</b>: MBSR may be a promising intervention for older adults experiencing a variety of health concerns and possibly even cognitive decline. MBCT may reduce geriatric anxiety, although its effects on geriatric depression were not measured.

AB  - PURPOSE: This article presents an in-depth, idiographic study examining the lived experience of chronic pain following spinal cord injury (SCI). Neuropathic pain (NP) occurs in a large majority of the SCI population and is particularly intractable to treatment. It can be both psychologically and physically debilitating. This study examines how the experience of NP is mediated by its meaning to the sufferer. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight people with SCI and chronic NP, attending outpatient clinics at a specialist SCI Centre in the UK. Verbatim transcripts were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis to further understand the experience. RESULTS: Analysis suggested that NP has powerful consequences upon the sufferer's physical, psychological and social well-being, in line with a biopsychosocial understanding of pain. Three super-ordinate themes were identified: a perceived gap between treatments received and participants' views of what they wanted and needed; a fight for life control and acceptance; and feeling understood by others with SCI, but isolated from the non-understanding able-bodied. CONCLUSIONS: The results are discussed in terms of the possible application of acceptance-based therapy to NP and the potential for the alleviation of the debilitating consequences of NP. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Chronic NP after SCI is often described as worse than the injury itself, often impacting upon the sufferers physical and psychological health. The experiences of persons with SCI-specific NP highlight the impact of pain on their physical, psychological and social health. This indicates that healthcare professionals should incorporate a biopsychosocial approach for managing pain post-SCI. Routine clinical follow-up of SCI patients with chronic NP, as well as comprehensive pain management treatment programmes, could address the three themes evidenced in the current study, by moving routine intervention with NP away from pain relief, towards pain management. Continued education for patients, friends, family members and healthcare professionals may be beneficial in promoting understanding and awareness of NP and its consequences following SCI.

AB  - Five hundred and three patients with RA were questioned about the symptom of back pain. Chronic back pain, lasting more than 3 months, occurred in 33 per cent of the group. A group of 100 back pain patients were studied in more detail using a structured questionnaire, clinical examination and radiology. Ninety-four of these patients had low back pain. Particular clinical patterns (such as that of the facet syndrome) were sought but no clear characteristics were found. Fifty-two lumbar spine X-rays were available from the RA population and these were compared to 52 age and sex matched X-rays from outpatients with chronic mechanical low back pain. Significant differences between these groups radiologically were a higher frequency of osteoporosis and a higher frequency of disc narrowing without associated osteophytes in the RA population. This study differs from previous reports which found other characteristic radiological features of RA of the lumbar spine (spondylolisthesis, facet erosions, and vertebral fracture), a discrepancy possibly resulting from the use of a control group having low back pain.

AB  - Mindfulness is a way of managing chronic pain and its consequences as it fosters anaccepting approach to pain that can be beneficial in several aspects of life affected bypain. This study sought to examine whether an online mindfulness training programcould reduce the experience of pain, increase acceptance of pain, and increase qualityof life in a group of individuals suffering from chronic pain. The study was arandomized controlled trial with a partly active control group. Initially 52 participantswere randomized to the intervention group and 55 to the control group. The drop outrates were high, 21 participants from the intervention group and 40 participants fromthe control group completed post measurement. Increased levels of mindfulness,reduced pain related distress, and heightened pain acceptance, as well as increasedquality of life, was observed in the intervention group. A strong tendency towards aperceived reduction of pain intensity was also evident in the intervention group. Asthe mindfulness program had positive effects on the overall experience of pain it mayserve as a cost‐effective and useful method of dealing with chronic pain.

AB  - Clinical guidelines discourage prescribing opioids for chronic pain, but give minimal advice about how to discuss opioid tapering with patients. We conducted focus groups and interviews involving 21 adults with chronic back or neck pain in different stages of opioid tapering. Transcripts were qualitatively analyzed to characterize patients' tapering experiences, build a conceptual model of these experiences, and identify strategies for promoting productive discussions of opioid tapering. Analyses revealed 3 major themes. First, owing to dynamic changes in patients' social relationships, emotional state, and health status, patients' pain and their perceived need for opioids fluctuate daily; this finding may conflict with recommendations to taper by a certain amount each month. Second, tapering requires substantial patient effort across multiple domains of patients' everyday lives; patients discuss this effort superficially, if at all, with clinicians. Third, patients use a variety of strategies to manage the tapering process (eg, keeping an opioid stash, timing opioid consumption based on planned activities). Recommendations for promoting productive tapering discussions include understanding the social and emotional dynamics likely to impact patients' tapering, addressing patient fears, focusing on patients' best interests, providing anticipatory guidance about tapering, and developing an individualized tapering plan that can be adjusted based on patient response. Perspective: This study used interview and focus group data to characterize patients' experiences with opioid tapering and identify communication strategies that are likely to foster productive, patient-centered discussions of opioid tapering. Findings will inform further research on tapering and help primary care clinicians to address this important, often challenging topic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the usage and accessibility problems faced by the disabled (whether in pain or not) users of assistive devices (conventional wheelchairs), identify physical barriers that limit their mobility, and recognize the socio-cultural practices excluding them from the design process of such devices. Another main purpose of this paper is to improve the ergonomic criteria that influence the design and manufacture of assistive devices. Materials and method: STUDY POPULATION: 15 patients with any of the following diagnoses: ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, or amputees using wheelchairs in Mexico and Colombia. DESIGN: Qualitative study. Thematic analysis with a theoretical industrial design approach to employing usability testing for ergonomic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 6 issues associated with usability problems from the patient's standpoint: barriers for use of wheelchairs (usability and acceptability), creative adaptations, potential use of technical devices, independence, body perception and assistive devices, and architectural barriers. The ergonomic and usability requirements and the resulting level of independence vary across wheelchair users with chronic pain and those whose disability does not involve pain. The latter are more independent in their movements and decisions. CONCLUSIONS: User input is essential in the design of assistive devices. The proposal of "design from and for the user" must rely on both engineering and medical perspective on the ergonomy as well as the user interpretation of the environment and the experience of the disease. Thus we can arrive at a "user-centered design".

AB  - Background: Due to the recurrent nature of low back pain (LBP), the traditional concepts of cure and recovery are challenged, and investigating the course rather than status at fixed time-points may help us understand prognosis as well as treatment effect. However, methods of frequent measuring still need development and validation. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the agreement between continuous, quantitative self-assessment (weekly SMS) of the course of LBP over a one-year period and qualitatively derived retrospective patient self-appraisal of the same time-period. Methods: Participants were 32 subjects with LBP from primary care. The quantitative measures consisted of weekly SMS questions for one-year about pain intensity, days with LBP, and activity limitations for that week. For each subject, the weekly responses were graphed and categorized into categories based on intensity, variation and overall change patterns. Qualitative measures were based on semi-structured telephone interviews one-year after a consultation for LBP, where two coders independently categorized the self-appraisal of LBP course into the same predefined categories as the SMS-based trajectories. Furthermore, patients' perceived overall recovery was related to variation patterns from SMS track. Results: There was perfect agreement for 48% in the pain intensity domain, 53% in the variation domain and 63% in the change pattern domain. Most of the discordant cases were classified in neighboring categories with the majority relating to fluctuating patterns. The self-perceived overall recovery status seemed to be reflected quite well by the quantitative measures of pain intensity and days with pain in this study. Conclusion: This study shows that a real time quantitative measure (weekly SMS) and the patient's retrospective appraisal do not fundamentally differ in their reflection of the one-year course of LBP.As a first investigation into this area, these results are promising, as longitudinal quantitatively derived trajectories of LBP seem to reflect the lived experience of the patient to a large degree. Furthermore, the patient's ability to retrospectively recall their one-year course of LBP appears to be quite good. Future studies should focus on refining the categories of trajectories.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: to review and update the evidence for different forms of manual therapy (MT) for patients with different stages of non-specific low back pain (LBP). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane-Register-of-Controlled-Trials, PEDro, EMBASE. METHOD: A systematic review of MT with a literature search covering the period of January 2000 to April 2013 was conducted by two independent reviewers according to Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. A total of 360 studies were evaluated using qualitative criteria. Two stages of LBP were categorized; combined acute-subacute and chronic. Further sub-classification was made according to MT intervention: MT1 (manipulation); MT2 (mobilization and soft-tissue-techniques); and MT3 (MT1 combined with MT2). In each sub-category, MT could be combined or not with exercise or usual medical care (UMC). Consequently, quantitative evaluation criteria were applied to 56 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and hence 23 low-risk of bias RCTs were identified for review. Only studies providing new updated information (11/23 RCTs) are presented here. RESULTS: Acute-subacute LBP: STRONG-evidence in favour of MT1 when compared to sham for pain, function and health improvements in the short-term (1-3 months). MODERATE-evidence to support MT1 and MT3 combined with UMC in comparison to UMC alone for pain, function and health improvements in the short-term. Chronic LBP: MODERATE to STRONG-evidence in favour of MT1 in comparison to sham for pain, function and overall-health in the short-term. MODERATE-evidence in favour of MT3 combined with exercise or UMC in comparison to exercise and back-school was established for pain, function and quality-of-life in the short and long-term. LIMITED-evidence in favour of MT2 combined with exercise and UMC in comparison to UMC alone for pain and function from short to long-term. LIMITED-evidence of no effect for MT1 with extension-exercise compared to extension-exercise alone for pain in the short to long-term. CONCLUSION: This systematic review updates the evidence for MT with exercise or UMC for different stages of LBP and provides recommendations for future studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of people with neurological conditions who take the chronic disease self-management (CDSM) programme. The CDSM programme is used to teach skills to manage chronic conditions, and prevent secondary conditions. Few studies have explored the use of the CDSM programme with people with neurological conditions, in spite of the long standing and sometimes unpredictable nature of those conditions. METHOD: This qualitative study explored the experience of people with stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury (SCI) who participated in the CDSM programme. We completed individual interviews using a semi-structured interview guide with 22 individuals with stroke, MS and SCI. RESULTS: Five categories emerged from the interview discussions including: (1) pre-programme influences; (2) group; (3) factors affecting learning opportunities; (4) workshop content and (5) outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide insights regarding the optimal way to present the CDSM programme to people with neurological conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sciatica is a common condition worldwide that is characterized by radiating leg pain and regularly caused by a herniated disc with nerve root compression. Sciatica patients with persisting leg pain after six to eight weeks were found to have similar clinical outcomes and associated costs after prolonged conservative treatment or surgery at one year follow-up. Guidelines recommend that the team of professionals involved in sciatica care and patients jointly decide about treatment options, so-called interprofessional shared decision making (SDM). However, there are strong indications that SDM for sciatica patients is not integrated in daily practice. We designed a study aiming to explore the barriers and facilitators associated with the everyday embedding of SDM for sciatica patients. All related relevant professionals and patients are involved to develop a tailored strategy to implement SDM for sciatica patients. METHODS: The study consists of two phases: identification of barriers and facilitators and development of an implementation strategy. First, barriers and facilitators are explored using semi-structured interviews among eight professionals of each (para)medical discipline involved in sciatica care (general practitioners, physical therapists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and orthopedic surgeons). In addition, three focus groups will be conducted among patients. Second, the identified barriers and facilitators will be ranked using a questionnaire among a representative Dutch sample of 200 GPs, 200 physical therapists, 200 neurologists, all 124 neurosurgeons, 200 orthopedic surgeons, and 100 patients. A tailored team-based implementation strategy will be developed based on the results of the first phase using the principles of intervention mapping and an expert panel. DISCUSSION: Little is known about effective strategies to increase the uptake of SDM. Most implementation strategies only target a single discipline, whereas multiple disciplines are involved in SDM among sciatica patients. The results of this study can be used as an example for implementing SDM in other patient groups receiving multidisciplinary complex care (e.g., elderly) and can be generalized to other countries with similar context, thereby contributing to a worldwide increase of SDM in preference sensitive choices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The adult lifetime incidence for low back pain is 75% to 85% in the United States. Investigating appropriate care has proven difficult, since, in general, acute pain subsides spontaneously and chronic pain is resistant to intervention. Subacute back pain has been rarely studied. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative efficacy of chiropractic adjustments with muscle relaxants and placebo/sham for subacute low back pain. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind clinical trial. METHODS: Subjects (N = 192) experiencing low back pain of 2 to 6 weeks' duration were randomly allocated to 3 groups with interventions applied over 2 weeks. Interventions were either chiropractic adjustments with placebo medicine, muscle relaxants with sham adjustments, or placebo medicine with sham adjustments. Visual Analog Scale for Pain, Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, and Modified Zung Depression Scale were assessed at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. Schober's flexibility test, acetaminophen usage, and Global Impression of Severity Scale (GIS), a physician's clinical impression used as a secondary outcome, were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks. RESULTS: Baseline values, except GIS, were similar for all groups. When all subjects completing the protocol were combined (N = 146), the data revealed pain, disability, depression, and GIS decreased significantly (P <.0001); lumbar flexibility did not change. Statistical differences across groups were seen for pain, a primary outcome, (chiropractic group improved more than control group) and GIS (chiropractic group improved more than other groups). No significant differences were seen for disability, depression, flexibility, or acetaminophen usage across groups. CONCLUSION: Chiropractic was more beneficial than placebo in reducing pain and more beneficial than either placebo or muscle relaxants in reducing GIS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research suggests female and black patients receive less optimal treatment for their chronic pain compared with male and white patients. Provider-related factors are hypothesized to contribute to unequal treatment, but these factors have not been examined extensively. This mixed methods investigation examined the influence of patients' demographic characteristics on providers' treatment decisions and providers' awareness of these influences on their treatment decisions. METHODS: Twenty medical trainees made treatment decisions (opioid, antidepressant, physical therapy) for 16 virtual patients with chronic low back pain; patient sex and race were manipulated across patients. Participants then indicated from a provided list the factors that influenced their treatment decisions, including patient demographics. Finally, individual interviews were conducted to discuss the role of patient demographics on providers' clinical decisions. RESULTS: Individual regression analyses indicated that 30% of participants were reliably influenced by patient sex and 15% by patient race when making their decisions (P < 0.05 or P < 0.10). Group analyses indicated that white patients received higher antidepressant recommendations, on average, than black patients (P < 0.05). Half of the medical trainees demonstrated awareness of the influence of demographic characteristics on their decision making. Participants , regardless of whether they were influenced by patients' demographics, discussed themes related to patient sex and race; however, participants' discussion of patient demographics in the interviews did not always align with their online study results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest there is a considerable variability in the extent to which medical trainees are influenced by patient demographics and their awareness of these decision making influences.

AB  - Chronic pain is prevalent in elderly populations. The goals of this study were 1) to understand the results of a randomized clinical trial - Qigong and Exercise Therapy for Elderly Patients with Chronic Neck Pain (QIBANE) - that showed no difference between qigong, exercise therapy, and no-treatment on quality of life, and 2) to understand how elderly individuals with chronic pain experience interventions of qigong and exercise therapy. A qualitative interview study was conducted with 20 QIBANE participants. Interviews asked about motivation for and expectations of trial participation, experiences with the exercise classes (qigong or exercise therapy), and changes in pain experience. Interviews were transcribed, entered into the software program ATLAS.ti, and coded thematically by two coders. Content analysis was performed. All interviewees reflected positively on their QIBANE experience and described their participation in QIBANE as helpful. However, what was discussed in both groups when they talked about "positive experiences" in the study differed between the two groups. For example, themes that emerged in the exercise-therapy group related to difficulties associated with aging and staying physically active. In the interviews with qigong group members, emergent themes related to qigong as a method that improved bodily experiences and influenced daily activities. The effects that exercise therapy and qigong have on an elderly population cannot be captured by health-related quality-of-life measurements, such as the Short Form (36) Health Survey. Broader concepts of quality of life that include the concepts of self-efficacy and positive affect may be more appropriate. The results presented in this study suggest that for this population group, the approach of patient-centered outcomes is especially pertinent in order to design meaningful intervention studies in the elderly. This means that research questions, interventions, and outcome measurements need to take into account the special situation of elderly people.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of culture-sensitive patient information material compared with standard translated material. DESIGN: Multicentre, double-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 37 primary care practices. PARTICIPANTS: 435 adult primary care patients with a migration background with unipolar depressive disorder or non-specific chronic low back pain were randomised. Patients who were unable to read in the language of their respective migration background were excluded. Sufficient data were obtained from 203 women and 106 men. The largest group was of Russian origin (202 patients), followed by those of Turkish (52), Polish (30) and Italian (25) origin. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention group: provision of culture-sensitive adapted material. CONTROL GROUP: provision of standard translated material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: patient-rated usefulness (USE) assessed immediately after patients received the material. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: patient-rated usefulness after 8 weeks and 6 months, symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), back pain (Back Pain Core Set) and quality of life (WHO-5) assessed at all time points. RESULTS: Usefulness was found to be significantly higher (t=1.708, one-sided p=0.04) in the intervention group (USE-score=65.08, SE=1.43), compared with the control group (61.43, SE=1.63), immediately after patients received the material, in the intention-to-treat analysis, with a mean difference of 3.65 (one-sided 95% lower confidence limit=0.13). No significant differences were found for usefulness at follow-up (p=0.16, p=0.71). No significant effect was found for symptom severity in depression (p=0.95, p=0.66, p=0.58), back pain (p=0.40, p=0.45, p=0.32) or quality of life (p=0.76, p=0.86, p=0.21), either immediately after receiving the material, or at follow-up (8 weeks; 6 months). Patients with a lower level of dominant society immersion benefited substantially and significantly more from the intervention than patients with a high level of immersion (p=0.005). CONCLUSION: Cultural adaptation of patient information material provides benefits over high quality translations. Clinicians are encouraged to use culture-sensitive material in their consultations, particularly with low-acculturated patients.

AB  - Background: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are common complaints among workers who work in intensive manual labor including informal workers. Workers who have worked with prolonged improper posture have clearly decreased their physical fitness and increased the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence of muscular discomfort and to assess the physical fitness of informal garment female workers. Material and Method: The subjects were 1,674 informal garment female workers in Udon Thani Province. Data were collected by using a structured questionnaire including complaints of muscular discomfort. Physical fitness tests were done by using standard tools for testing back-leg strength, flexibility and hand grip strength. Results: The highest complaint of muscular discomfort during the last month was located at the low back (41.75%), followed by the shoulders (41.21%). Considering the severity as severe discomfort, the highest prevalence was found at the low back (61.47%), followed by neck (61.23%). Those two areas were also presented as the highest frequency of discomfort for every day pain. In general, the majority of workers had physical fitness at fair level and low back strength significantly correlated with muscular discomfort. Conclusion: The significant findings among informal garment workers were muscular discomfort predominantly located on the low back and the factor of low back strength correlated with that muscular discomfort. The suggestion is there should be a supporting surveillance program for prevention of chronic low back pain by a prospective cohort study as well as maintaining the physical fitness by an exercise program for these informal garment workers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe recruitment and enrollment experiences of 2 low back pain (LBP) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DESIGN: Descriptive report. SETTING: Chiropractic research center in the midwest United States that is not a fee-for-service clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Both trials enrolled participants with subacute or chronic LBP without neurologic signs who had not received spinal manipulative care during the previous month. For study 1 we screened 1940 potential participants to enroll 192 participants (89 women and 103 men), mean age 40.0 +/- 9.4 years (range, 21-54 years). For study 2 we screened 1849 potential participants to enroll 240 participants (105 women and 135 men) at least 55 years old (mean, 63.1 +/- 6.7 years). INTERVENTIONS: Study 1 randomly assigned participants to 2 weeks of 2 different chiropractic techniques or a wait list control group. Study 2 randomly assigned participants to 6 weeks of 2 different chiropractic techniques or medical care consisting of 3 provider visits for medications. OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment source costs and yield, and baseline characteristics of enrolled versus nonparticipants were recorded. RESULTS: We conducted 3789 telephone screens for both trials to enroll 432 (11%) participants, at a cost in excess of $156,000 for recruitment efforts. The cost per call for all callers averaged $41, ranging from $4 to $300 based on recruitment method; for enrolled participants, the cost per call was $361, ranging from $33 to $750. Direct mail efforts accounted for 62% of all callers, 57% for enrolled participants, and had the second lowest cost per call for recruitment efforts. CONCLUSIONS: It is important that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) research can be successfully conducted at CAM institutions. However, the costs associated with recruitment efforts for studies conducted at CAM institutions may be higher than expected and many self-identified participants are users of the CAM therapy. Therefore, strategies for efficient recruitment methods and targeting nonusers of CAM therapies should be developed early for CAM trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chiropractic care is used by many older patients for low back pain (LBP), but there are no published results of randomized trials examining spinal manipulation (SM) for older adults. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of 2 biomechanically distinct forms of SM and minimal conservative medical care (MCMC) for participants at least 55 years old with subacute or chronic nonradicular LBP. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome variable was low back-related disability assessed with the 24-item Roland Morris Disability questionnaire at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Participants were randomly allocated to 6 weeks of care including 12 visits of either high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA)-SM, low-velocity, variable-amplitude (LVVA)-SM, or 3 visits of MCMC. RESULTS: Two hundred forty participants (105 women and 135 men) ages 63.1 +/- 6.7 years without significant comorbidities. Adjusted mean Roland Morris Disability change scores (95% confidence intervals) from baseline to the end of active care were 2.9 (2.2, 3.6) and 2.7 (2.0, 3.3) in the LVVA-SM and HVLA-SM groups, respectively, and 1.6 (0.5, 2.8) in the MCMC group. There were no significant differences between LVVA-SM and HVLA-SM at any of the end points. The LVVA-SM group had significant improvements in mean functional status ranging from 1.3 to 2.2 points over the MCMC group. There were no serious adverse events associated with any of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Biomechanically distinct forms of SM did not lead to different outcomes in older LBP patients and both SM procedures were associated with small yet clinically important changes in functional status by the end of treatment for this relatively healthy older population. Participants who received either form of SM had improvements on average in functional status ranging from 1 to 2.2 over those who received MCMC. From an evidence-based care perspective, patient preference and clinical experience should drive how clinicians and patients make the SM procedure decision for this patient population.

AB  - <b>Background</b>: Physiotherapists may use a diverse range of educational approaches during the treatment of people with chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, little is known about how physiotherapists clinically reason their use of education in practice. <b>Purpose</b>: The aim of this study was to develop insight into physiotherapists' clinical reasoning when using education for the treatment of people with CLBP. <b>Methods</b>: This qualitative study used a constructivist grounded theory inspired methodology. A purposive sample of five musculoskeletal physiotherapists from the United Kingdom were recruited via social media. Data were collected through audio recorded semi-structured interviews, field notes and memos, and were coded and analyzed using a constant comparative method. <b>Findings</b>: A concept of 'personalizing education' underpinned by three main categories termed 'exploring the person's world', 'making sense of the person's world' and 'tailoring education', has been constructed to explain the participating physiotherapists' clinical reasoning. <b>Conclusion</b>: The findings highlight how communication and interaction underpin the clinical reasoning process for using education with people who have CLBP. Participating physiotherapists explored and made sense of a person's world before tailoring their educational approach for the individual. Physiotherapists can use this paper to reflect on their practice to inform their own clinical reasoning.

AB  - Chronic back pain is a global phenomenon and a common reason why patients seek help from health professionals. Person-centered interprofessional working is acknowledged as the main strategy for chronic back pain management; however, the complexity of chronic pain can present significant challenges for teams. Although methods used by interprofessional teams to collaborate have been previously explored, how they work together to deliver person-centered chronic back pain care has received limited attention. The aim of this study was to explore person-centered care from the perspectives of people with chronic back pain and the interprofessional teams who cared for them. A grounded theory methodology was used to capture the interprofessional team's perspectives of person-centered working. A purposive sample of four chronic back pain management teams participated in semi-structured face-to-face interviews and focus groups. Data were thematically analyzed using a constant comparative method. Three categories emerged, collective efficacy, negotiated space and team maturity, which illustrated the attributes of interprofessional teams that influenced person-centered working. The findings suggest that collective efficacy matures over time within a negotiated coalesced space and re-enforces the need for teams to stick together to ensure effective person-centered care.

AB  - Chronic insomnia is a major public health problem affecting approximately 10% of adults. Use of meditation and yoga to develop mindful awareness (‘mindfulness training’) may be an effective approach to treat chronic insomnia, with sleep outcomes comparable to nightly use of prescription sedatives, but more durable and with minimal or no side effects. The purpose of this study was to understand mindfulness training as experienced by patients with chronic insomnia, and suggest procedures that may be useful in optimizing sleep benefits. Adults (N = 18) who completed an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program as part of a randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia were invited to participate in post-trial focus groups. Two groups were held. Participants (n = 9) described how their sleep routine, thoughts and emotions were affected by MBSR and about utility (or not) of various mindfulness techniques. Groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. Four themes were identified: the impact of mindfulness on sleep and motivation to adopt a healthy sleep lifestyle; benefits of mindfulness on aspects of life beyond sleep; challenges and successes in adopting mindfulness-based practices; and the importance of group sharing and support. Participants said they were not sleeping more, but sleeping better, waking more refreshed, feeling less distressed about insomnia, and better able to cope when it occurred. Some participants experienced the course as a call to action, and for them, practicing meditation and following sleep hygiene guidelines became priorities. Motivation to sustain behavioral changes was reinforced by feeling physically better and more emotionally stable, and seeing others in the MBSR class improve. The body scan was identified as an effective tool to enable falling asleep faster. Participants described needing to continue practicing mindfulness to maintain benefits. First-person accounts are consistent with published trial results of positive impacts of MBSR on sleep measured by sleep diary, actigraphy, and self-report sleep scales. Findings indicate that mindfulness training in a group format, combined with sleep hygiene education, is important for effective application of MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia.

AB  - Despite enormous growth in the use of consumer self-tracking devices, the data that many patients collect about their condition is seldom integrated into conversations that take place in the clinic. In this paper we explore the potential roles that self-tracking data could play during clinical interactions between patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (a chronic rheumatic disease) and their clinicians. We develop a model of the data-centric activities that currently take place within the rheumatology clinic, using field observations, and to discuss how self-tracking data may contribute to each of these activities. We also interview two consultant rheumatologists regarding the opportunities and challenges that the use of selftracking data may bring. We propose four different roles for self-tracking data in the clinic and discuss possible directions for designing to support these roles.

AB  - The differences in quality of life and school absence were studied in one hundred adolescents from the open population who had reported chronic headache or chronic, physically unexplained, pain at other locations. The adolescents kept a 3-week diary about their pain and completed a quality of life questionnaire. Of all chronic pain sufferers in this study, it was the adolescents with headache who showed the least frequent pain, but they reported the poorest quality of life and the largest school absence due to their pain. Adolescents with headache or adolescents with back pain showed the highest negative correlations between pain parameters and quality of life. Headache sufferers showed highly negative relationships between pain parameters and most quality of life domains (median r = -0.46), and only in headache sufferers did this involve both intensity and frequency of pain. Qualitative studies are needed to reveal the background to these differences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a persistent disabling condition with rising significant healthcare, social and economic costs. Current research supports the use of exercise-based treatment approaches that encourage people with CLBP to assume a physically active role in their recovery. While international clinical guidelines and systematic reviews for CLBP support supervised group exercise as an attractive first-line option for treating large numbers of CLBP patients at low cost, barriers to their delivery include space and time restrictions in healthcare settings and poor patient attendance. The European Clinical Guidelines have identified the need for research in the use of brief/minimal contact self-activation interventions that encourage participation in physical activity for CLBP. Walking may be an ideally suited form of individualized exercise prescription as it is easy to do, requires no special skills or facilities, and is achievable by virtually all ages with little risk of injury, but its effectiveness for LBP is unproven. METHODS AND DESIGN: This study will be an assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial that will investigate the difference in clinical effectiveness and costs of an individualized walking programme and a supervised general exercise programme compared to usual physiotherapy, which will act as the control group, in people with chronic low back pain. A sample of 246 patients will be recruited in Dublin, Ireland through acute general hospital outpatient physiotherapy departments that provide treatment for people with CLBP. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the three groups in a concealed manner. The main outcomes will be functional disability, pain, quality of life, fear avoidance, back beliefs, physical activity, satisfaction and costs, which will be evaluated at baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 months [follow-up by pre-paid postage]. Qualitative telephone interviews and focus groups will be embedded in the research design to obtain feedback about participants' experiences of the interventions and trial participation, and to inform interpretation of the quantitative data. Planned analysis will be by intention to treat (quantitative data) and thematic analysis (qualitative data) DISCUSSION: The trial will evaluate the effectiveness of a walking programme and a supervised general exercise programme compared to usual physiotherapy in people with CLBP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current controlled trial ISRCTN17592092.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance is becoming increasingly recognised as a clinically important symptom in people with chronic low back pain (CLBP, low back pain >12 weeks), associated with physical inactivity and depression. Current research and international clinical guidelines recommend people with CLBP assume a physically active role in their recovery to prevent chronicity, but the high prevalence of sleep disturbance in this population may be unknowingly limiting their ability to participate in exercise-based rehabilitation programmes and contributing to poor outcomes. There is currently no knowledge concerning the effectiveness of physiotherapy on sleep disturbance in people with chronic low back pain and no evidence of the feasibility of conducting randomized controlled trials that comprehensively evaluate sleep as an outcome measure in this population. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will evaluate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT), exploring the effects of three forms of physiotherapy (supervised general exercise programme, individualized walking programme and usual physiotherapy, which will serve as the control group) on sleep quality in people with chronic low back pain. A presenting sample of 60 consenting patients will be recruited in the physiotherapy department of Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, and randomly allocated to one of the three groups in a concealed manner. The main outcomes will be sleep quality (self-report and objective measurement), and self-reported functional disability, pain, quality of life, fear avoidance, anxiety and depression, physical activity, and patient satisfaction. Outcome will be evaluated at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. Qualitative telephone interviews will be embedded in the research design to obtain feedback from a sample of participants' about their experiences of sleep monitoring, trial participation and interventions, and to inform the design of a fully powered future RCT. Planned analysis will explore trends in the data, effect sizes and clinically important effects (quantitative data), and thematic analysis (qualitative data). DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial exploring the effects of three forms of physiotherapy (supervised general exercise programme, individualized walking programme and usual physiotherapy, which will serve as the control group) on sleep quality in people with chronic low back pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current controlled trial ISRCTN54009836.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Medical Research Council framework provides a useful general approach to designing and evaluating complex interventions, but does not provide detailed guidance on how to do this and there is little evidence of how this framework is applied in practice. This study describes the use of intervention mapping (IM) in the design of a theory-driven, group-based complex intervention to support self-management (SM) of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) in Ireland's primary care health system. METHODS: The six steps of the IM protocol were systematically applied to develop the self-management of osteoarthritis and low back pain through activity and skills (SOLAS) intervention through adaptation of the Facilitating Activity and Self-management in Arthritis (FASA) intervention. A needs assessment including literature reviews, interviews with patients and physiotherapists and resource evaluation was completed to identify the programme goals, determinants of SM behaviour, consolidated definition of SM and required adaptations to FASA to meet health service and patient needs and the evidence. The resultant SOLAS intervention behavioural outcomes, performance and change objectives were specified and practical application methods selected, followed by organised programme, adoption, implementation and evaluation plans underpinned by behaviour change theory. RESULTS: The SOLAS intervention consists of six weekly sessions of 90-min education and exercise designed to increase participants' physical activity level and use of evidence-based SM strategies (i.e. pain self-management, pain coping, healthy eating for weight management and specific exercise) through targeting of individual determinants of SM behaviour (knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, fear, catastrophizing, motivation, behavioural regulation), delivered by a trained physiotherapist to groups of up to eight individuals using a needs supportive interpersonal style based on self-determination theory. Strategies to support SOLAS intervention adoption and implementation included a consensus building workshop with physiotherapy stakeholders, development of a physiotherapist training programme and a pilot trial with physiotherapist and patient feedback. CONCLUSIONS: The SOLAS intervention is currently being evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial. IM is a time-intensive collaborative process, but the range of methods and resultant high level of transparency is invaluable and allows replication by future complex intervention and trial developers.

AB  - AIMS: Chronic knee, hip and back pain is extremely prevalent. Management guidelines emphasise maintaining physical activity and healthy weight to reduce pain and improve physical and mental wellbeing. Unfortunately, few people receive support to make lifestyle changes. We evaluated whether a health trainer-led 'joint pain advice' (JPA) service delivering person-centred lifestyle coaching was feasible, acceptable and effective for people with knee, hip and back pain. METHODS: Feasibility of delivering a JPA service was assessed by documenting whether the health trainers could deliver JPA and its uptake. Nine health trainers delivered JPA. Participants were offered up to four appointments. At each appointment, health trainers gave people information about their condition, co-developed care plans, suggested self-management strategies and used behavioural change techniques (motivational interviewing, goal-setting and action planning) to increase physical activity and reduce body weight. Pain, function, physical activity and body mass index (BMI) were collected at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months. Focus groups captured people's opinions of the service's effectiveness, acceptability and usefulness. RESULTS: Of the 105 people who enquired about JPA, 85 (81%) used the service, after which their physical activity and function improved, and pain, use of analgesia and BMI decreased. They felt more knowledgeable and better motivated to adopt and maintain healthier behaviours. They attributed these improvements to the JPA service, because of its better consultations and collaborative holistic approach. Only a minority attended all four appointments because they felt they received sufficient advice from the initial appointments. The health trainers gained knowledge and skills to support clients with musculoskeletal conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Using a holistic, patient-centred approach, health trainers can deliver lifestyle advice to people with chronic knee, hip or back pain safely, effectively and efficiently. The service was popular with recipients and health trainers, and helped people adopt healthier lifestyles that lead to reduced pain and other clinical improvements.

AB  - Study Design: Observational study conducted within a randomized clinical trial.Objectives: The objective of this study is to estimate the effects of patient satisfaction on subsequent changes in pain and disability among low back pain patients randomized to chiropractic or medical care in a managed-care practice setting.Summary Of Background Data: Recent studies of low back pain treatments have shown chiropractic patients to be more satisfied with their care than medical patients. However, little is known about the relation between patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.Methods: A total of 681 low back pain patients presenting to three southern California healthcare clinics and screened for serious spinal pathology and contraindications were randomized to medical care with and without physical therapy, and chiropractic care with and without physical modalities, and followed for 18 months. Satisfaction with back care was measured on a 40-point scale and observed at 4 weeks following randomization. The primary outcome variables, observed between 6 weeks and 18 months of follow-up, are average and most severe low back pain intensity in the past week, assessed with 0 to 10 numerical rating scales, low back-related disability, assessed with the 24-item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and remission from clinically meaningful pain and disability. Perceived change in low back symptoms was a secondary outcome.Results: Greater satisfaction increased the odds of remission from clinically meaningful pain and disability at 6 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [OR] for 10-point increase in satisfaction = 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.99, 2.68), but not at 6, 12, or 18 months (6 months: adjusted OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.73, 1.52; 12 months: adjusted OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.67, 1.32; 18 months: adjusted OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 0.76, 1.50). Perception of improvement was greater among highly satisfied than less satisfied patients throughout the 18-month follow-up period. The estimated effects of satisfaction on clinical outcomes were similar for medical and chiropractic patients.Conclusions: Patient satisfaction may confer small short-term clinical benefits for low back pain patients. Long-term perceived improvement may reflect, in part, perceived past improvement as measured by satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate patients' views about two common outcome measures used for back pain: Numerical Rating Scales for pain and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. SUBJECTS: Thirty-six working adults who had previously sought primary care for back pain and who could speak and read English. METHOD: Eight focus groups were conducted to explore participants' views about the 11-point Numerical Rating Scales and the 24-item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Each group was led by a facilitator and an interview topic guide was used. Audio recordings of focus groups were transcribed verbatim. Framework analysis was used to chart participants' views and an interpretive analysis performed to explain the findings. RESULTS: Participants reported that neither the Roland-Morris nor the Numerical Rating Scales captured the complex personal experience of pain or relevant changes in their condition. The time-frame of assessment was identified as particularly problematic and the Roland-Morris did not capture relevant functional domains. CONCLUSION: This study provides empirical data that working adults with persistent back pain consider these clinical outcome measures largely inadequate. These measures currently used for back pain may contribute to misleading conclusions about treatment efficacy and patient recovery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To propose standardized, patient-centered measures of recovery from nonspecific low back pain (LBP) in research, underpinned by an empirically derived concept of recovery and informed by expert opinion. DESIGN: Synthesis of literature reviews and expert panel opinion. SETTING: Primary care centers for the management of nonspecific LBP. PARTICIPANTS: Persons with nonspecific LBP. INTERVENTIONS: Conservative treatments for nonspecific LBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three phases of research were conducted. First, qualitative research that explored patients' perspectives of recovery from nonspecific LBP was reviewed. Second, measures of recovery used in LBP clinical trials during the past decade were investigated in a systematic review. Third, opinion was sought from an expert panel of clinicians and researchers about how to measure recovery from nonspecific LBP, in a workshop at the 10th International Forum for Primary Care Research in Low Back Pain. RESULTS: An empirically derived and patient-centered concept of recovery from nonspecific LBP was developed from the qualitative research phase. The systematic review conducted in the second study phase revealed that researchers have used vastly heterogeneous measures of LBP recovery in clinical trials during the past decade. Finally, the key conclusions of the LBP Forum workshop were (1) that appropriate patient-centered instruments to measure recovery include global measures and patient-specific measures; and (2) that the benefits of implementing the same recovery measures for acute and chronic LBP outweigh the disadvantages of using different measures. CONCLUSIONS: The results were synthesized to inform our recommendation that researchers consider adopting 2 instruments as standardized measures of recovery from nonspecific LBP, as an adjunct to the existing core set of LBP outcome measures. These instruments are an 11-point Global Back Recovery Scale, for a simple measure of global recovery, and the Patient-Generated Index of Quality of Life-Back Pain, to evaluate specific relevant dimensions of recovery. This recommendation has majority endorsement by members of the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Acute Low Back Pain Review Group.

AB  - Background: Understanding individual health literacy needs is crucial when designing supportive and effective health care. However, tools assessing health literacy in practice are lacking. The Conversational Health Literacy Assessment Tool (CHAT) was recently developed, but its ability to assess health literacy remains unexplored. We aimed to investigate the implementation and adoption of CHAT, its ability to increase awareness of health literacy among healthcare providers, and if CHAT could assess health literacy needs in patients. Methods: We performed a qualitative feasibility study of CHAT among healthcare providers (nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists) who provide rehabilitation services for patients with noncommunicable diseases in a municipal healthcare centre in Denmark. The study used the RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) to structure interview guide and analysis. We collected qualitative data from four small focus groups with healthcare providers (n = 11). The data were analysed using a deductive thematic three-step method for organising and interpreting data. All informants provided written informed consent prior to data collection. Results: CHAT seems to be a feasible and efficient tool for assessing health literacy needs among individuals with different socio-demographic characteristics and with different diagnoses. CHAT was easiest implemented and adopted by healthcare providers, who were already familiarly with the concept of health literacy. The informants emphasised that an introduction to CHAT and health literacy as concept was valuable for the adoption. Some of them felt frustrated that they did not have opportunity and options to meet the health literacy needs identified by CHAT. Conclusions: CHAT is a promising tool for assessing individual health literacy needs and increasing awareness of health literacy among healthcare providers. For successfully implementation of CHAT, we recommend developing a structured implementation programme, including an introduction to health literacy and an outline of the options for acting upon CHAT results.

AB  - This review examines existing preclinical and clinical studies related to resiniferatoxin (RTX) and its potential uses in pain treatment. Like capsaicin, RTX is a vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) agonist, only more potent. This increased potency confers both quantitative and qualitative advantages in terms of drug action on the TRPV1 containing nerve terminal, which result in an increased efficacy and a long duration of action. RTX can be delivered by a central route of administration through injection into the subarachnoid space around the lumbosacral spinal cord. It can also be administered peripherally into a region of skin or deep tissue where primary afferents nerves terminate, or directly into a nerve trunk or a dorsal root ganglion. The central route is currently being evaluated as a treatment for intractable pain in patients with advanced cancer. Peripheral administration offers the possibility to treat a wide diversity of pain problems because of the ability to bring the treatment to the site of the pain (the peripheral generator). While not all pain disorders are appropriate for RTX, tailoring treatment to an individual patient's needs via a selective and local intervention that chemically targets a specific population of nerve terminals provides a new capability for pain therapy and a simplified and effective approach to personalized pain medicine.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is highly prevalent and CLBP disability reinforces poverty and Nigerian rural-urban inequality. Most rural Nigerian dwellers with CLBP consult unconventional practitioners due to difficulty in accessing conventional health care. This interaction may influence back pain beliefs and behaviours, and health outcomes including disability. In line with the recent Lancet Low Back Pain series call to address widespread misconceptions in the population and among health practitioners about low back pain, this study explored the beliefs and management strategies of unconventional practitioners consulted by people living with CLBP in rural Nigeria. Qualitative semi-structured face-to-face individual interviews. Thematic analysis of transcripts was performed using the Framework approach. Nine unconventional practitioners consented to participate in this study. Patent medicine sellers and herbalists had biomedical beliefs about CLBP and encouraged passivity and drug dependence in patients. Pastors adopted spiritual or biopsychosocial-spiritual management models and either encouraged spiritual CLBP causal beliefs and spiritual healing expectations; or patients' resilience and acceptance, respectively. Unconventional practitioners' CLBP beliefs and management strategies aligned with the beliefs and coping strategies of patients who consulted them. Unconventional practitioners' beliefs and management strategies may therefore contribute to the adverse impact of CLBP in rural Nigeria.

AB  - Background: Globally, the leading cause of years lived with disability is low back pain (LBP). Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is responsible for most of the cost and disability associated with LBP. This is more devastating in low income countries, particularly in rural Nigeria with one of the greatest global burdens of LBP. No Igbo back pain specific measure captures remunerative or non-remunerative work outcomes. Disability measurement using these tools may not fully explain work-related disability and community participation, a limitation not evident in the World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0). This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt the WHODAS 2.0 and validate it in rural and urban Nigerian populations with CLBP.Methods: Translation, cultural adaptation, test-retest, and cross-sectional psychometric testing was performed. WHODAS 2.0 was forward and back translated by clinical/non-clinical translators. Expert review committee evaluated the translations. Twelve people with CLBP in a rural Nigerian community piloted/pre-tested the questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha assessing internal consistency; intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots assessing test-retest reliability; and minimal detectable change were investigated in a convenience sample of 50 adults with CLBP in rural and urban Nigeria. Construct validity was examined using Spearman's correlation analyses with the back-performance scale, Igbo Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and eleven-point box scale; and exploratory factor analysis in a random sample of 200 adults with CLBP in rural Nigeria. Ceiling and floor effects were investigated in both samples.Results: Patient instructions were also translated. 'Waist pain/lower back pain' was added to 'illness(es)' to make the measure relevant for this study whilst allowing for future studies involving other conditions. The Igbo phrase for 'family and friends' was used to better represent 'people close to you' in item D4.3. The Igbo-WHODAS had good internal consistency (α = 0.75-0.97); intra class correlation coefficients (ICC = 0.81-0.93); standard error of measurements (5.05-11.10) and minimal detectable change (13.99-30.77). Igbo-WHODAS correlated moderately with performance-based disability, self-reported back pain-specific disability and pain intensity, with a seven-factor structure and no floor and ceiling effects.Conclusions: Igbo-WHODAS appears psychometrically sound. Its research and clinical utility require further testing.

AB  - Study Design: In this retrospective study, the long-term clinical results of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation in children less than 16 years of age were reviewed.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of surgical treatment including posterior discectomy, extraperitoneal anterolateral discectomy, and anterior interbody fusion for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation in children less than 16 years of age.Summary Of Background Data: Although previous follow-up studies on surgically managed lumbar intervertebral disc herniation in children and adolescents generally reveal good outcomes, few reports have focused on the time course of clinical findings and the long-term results.Methods: The outcome of subjective symptoms, clinical signs, and time-related change of the intervertebral disc space in 11 patients were evaluated with an average follow-up period of 9 years (range, 5-12 years).Results: The posterior discectomy procedure relieved clinical symptoms quickly. In the case of central herniation with or without intervertebral instability, extraperitoneal anterolateral discectomy or anterior interbody fusion led to favorable long-term results. Clinical symptoms (lower back pain, leg pain) and neurologic disturbance disappeared within 3 months after surgery. Recovery of normal straight leg raising test results (tight hamstrings), however, required much more time than recovery of other symptoms. Narrowing of the intervertebral disc space progressed up to 3-6 months after discectomy, but then disc space widening occurred.Conclusions: Satisfactory long-term clinical results and early return to school life were obtained with each surgical procedure. It is important to aim toward an early return to school via surgical treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To generate expert consensus evidence for the purpose of developing more complete guidelines for people with persistent low back pain than is possible using current research evidence alone. Gaps in research evidence lead to incomplete practice recommendations unless a scientific process can provide supplementary consensus evidence that is a basis for additional recommendations. DESIGN: A modified Nominal Group Technique (NGT). This followed a systematic review indicating incomplete research evidence. SETTING: UK-wide coordinated by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three individuals selected for their expertise as clinicians, researchers, managers and patients. METHODS: Three stages: a first-round questionnaire of clinical questions unanswered by the systematic review; an electronic conference for outstanding questions unanswered by the first questionnaire; and a second-round questionnaire for these outstanding questions. All three stages were carried out electronically. RESULTS: Of 17 clinical questions unanswered by the systematic review, consensus evidence was generated for 14 questions by the modified NGT and this led to 14 recommendations for practice. Consensus was not reached for the remaining three questions. CONCLUSIONS: The modified NGT was a practical and cost-effective way of generating consensus evidence from a UK-wide group. The consensus evidence was the basis of appropriately graded recommendations for effective care of people with persistent low back pain. Consensus methods have been little used in physiotherapy to date but are likely to be valuable in developing clinically useful, evidence-based tools for future practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Numerous studies have documented rates of chronic pain in developed western nations; however, little is known about its prevalence or correlates in rapidly developing countries, where much of the world's population lives. This study was designed to assess the prevalence of chronic pain among adults in Chongqing, China and the correlates of chronicity among respondents with pain and degree of impairment within the subgroup reporting chronic pain. DESIGN: A structured telephone interview was used within a cross-sectional design. Chronic pain was defined as the pain that had persisted for >=3 months. PARTICIPANTS: Adults from a random sample of 1003 Chongqing households completed a structured telephone interview on pain experiences of themselves and other family members over the past 6 months. RESULTS: Overall, 42.2% of interviewees reported pain for at least 1 day during the past 6 months and 25.8% experienced pain lasting for at least 3 months. The most common complaints were back pain (17.6%), headache (14.2%), joint pain, (10.5%), and abdominal pain (10.4%). Among those who reported pain, correlates of a chronic duration included older age, presence of back pain, heightened impairment, use of Chinese medicine, and greater numer of interventions used for pain management. For interviewees whose pain was chronic, increased functional impairment was related to older age, presence of pain every day, and increased likelihood of consulting physicians and using Chinese medicine to manage pain. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of chronic pain in Chongqing appear to approximate to those reported in western countries. A significant minority of those affected report substantial or severe impairment and are more likely than less impaired cohorts to have sought medical interventions to manage pain.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess sleep quality and comfort of participants diagnosed with low back pain and stiffness following sleep on individually prescribed mattresses based on dominant sleeping positions. Subjects consisted of 27 patients (females, n=14; males, n=13; age 44.8 yrs +/- SD 14.6, weight 174 lb. +/- SD 39.6, height 68.3 in. +/- SD 3.7) referred by chiropractic physicians for the study. For the baseline (pretest) data subjects recorded back and shoulder discomfort, sleep quality and comfort by visual analog scales (VAS) for 21 days while sleeping in their own beds. Subsequently, participants' beds were replaced by medium-firm mattresses specifically layered with foam and latex based on the participants' reported prominent sleeping position and they again rated their sleep comfort and quality daily for the following 12 weeks. Analysis yielded significant differences between pre- and post means for all variables and for back pain, we found significant (p<0.01) differences between the first posttest mean and weeks 4 and weeks 8-12, thus indicating progressive improvement in both back pain and stiffness while sleeping on the new mattresses. Additionally, the number of days per week of experiencing poor sleep and physical discomfort decreased significantly. It was concluded that sleep surfaces are related to sleep discomfort and that is indeed possible to reduce pain and discomfort and to increase sleep quality in those with chronic back pain by replacing mattresses based on sleeping position.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown that patient transfer is a risk factor for back pain, back injuries and long term sickness absence, whereas consistent use of assistive devices during patient transfer seems to be protective. While classical ergonomic interventions based on education and training in lifting and transferring techniques have not proven to be effective in preventing back pain, participatory ergonomics, that is meant to engage and motivate the involved parties while at the same time making the intervention maximally relevant, may represent a better solution. However, these findings are largely based on uncontrolled studies and thus lack to be confirmed by studies with better study designs. In this article, we present the design of a study which aims to evaluate the effect and process of a participatory organizational intervention for improved use of assistive devices. METHODS: The study was performed as a cluster randomized controlled trial. We recruited 27 departments (clusters) from five hospitals in Denmark to participate in the study. Prior to randomization, interviews, observations and questionnaire answers (baseline questionnaire) were collected to gain knowledge of barriers and potential solutions for better use of assistive devices. In April 2016, the 27 departments were randomly allocated using a random numbers table to a participatory intervention (14 clusters, 324 healthcare workers) or a control group (13 clusters, 318 healthcare workers). The participatory intervention will consist of workshops with leaders and selected healthcare workers of each department. Workshop participants will be asked to discuss the identified barriers, develop solutions for increasing the use of assistive devices and implement them in their department. Use of assistive devices (using digital counters -, primary outcome, and accelerometers and questionnaire - secondary outcome), perceived physical exertion during patient transfer, pain intensity in the lower back, occurrence of work-related back injuries during patient transfer, organizational readiness to change, knowledge on how to perform proper patient transfer, social capital and work ability (secondary outcomes) were assessed at baseline and will also be assessed at 1 year follow-up. Process evaluation will be based on qualitative and quantitative data to assess the implementation, the change process, and the impact of context aspects. DISCUSSION: The study will evaluate the effect and process of a participatory intervention on improving the use of assistive devices for patient transfer among hospital healthcare workers. By using cluster-randomization, as well as process- and effect evaluation based on objective measures we will contribute to the evidence base of a promising intervention approach.

AB  - Electronic data collection for monitoring pain has become increasingly popular in clinical research. However, no direct comparison has been made between electronic diaries and self-report paper diaries or phone interviews. We asked 36 patients with chronic low back pain to monitor their pain for 1 year; 20 of them used both a palmtop computer and paper diaries, and 16 used paper diaries alone. All patients were called once a week and asked to rate their pain. Regression analyses with a measurement error model were run on hourly pain scores recorded by both palmtop computer and paper diaries. Ratings of pain intensity were highly reliable between data recorded with a palmtop computer and with data from paper diaries. Patients who monitored their pain with the palmtop computer entered data on average 6.75 times a week and were 89.9% compliant with daily monitoring throughout the year. Two-way messaging available through the palmtop computer seemed to encourage continued use of the device. Internal consistency of reporting and correlations with phone reports and standardized measures were highly significant, suggesting that data from electronic diaries are both reliable and valid. Patients using electronic diaries preferred them to paper diaries and showed much higher rates of compliance and satisfaction over the 1-year trial.

AB  - Objective: This controlled trial examined the benefit of a high‐frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (hfTENS) device (the Quell, NeuroMetrix, Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods: Thirty‐five (n = 35) participants were randomly assigned to use the device each day for 3 months (experimental group) and were compared with 33 subjects without the device (treatment‐as‐usual control group). All patients were instructed to complete baseline questionnaires and were assessed on thresholds of pressure pain and mechanical temporal summation as part of standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST). The subjects also uploaded smartphone applications (apps) for tracking use of the hfTENS and for daily pain assessment. Each participant completed weekly phone interviews, was prompted to complete daily pain app assessments, and was asked to repeat the baseline questionnaires again after 6 weeks and 3 months. Results: Sixty percent of the subjects were female, 77.9% were Caucasian, and the average age was 46.2 years. Significant reductions in pain intensity (P < 0.01) and activity interference (P < 0.025) and significant improvements in pain catastrophizing (P < 0.025) were noted in the experimental group compared with the control group. No group differences were found on depression, anxiety, or pain‐related disability. Older subjects with a longer duration of pain tended to use the hfTENS more often. Subjects who showed greater sensitivity based on QST results revealed increased use of the hfTENS (P < 0.025) and tended to believe that the hfTENS was more helpful in reducing their back pain, but these findings did not reach significance (P = 0.09). Conclusion: These results suggest that hfTENS can have a moderate effect in reducing pain and improving quality of life in low back pain patients. Further trials designed to determine the mechanism of action of the hfTENS are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite positive outcomes, widespread implementation of telemedicine services in rehabilitation care is lacking. This could, for a large part, be attributed to a lack of end-user acceptance. The aim of this article is to look beyond the common theoretical approaches towards end-user acceptance (like the Technology Acceptance Model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology), and to explore the factors that contribute to or hinder the acceptance of a telemedicine service for rehabilitation care by patients with a chronic disease. METHODS: A qualitative, exploratory focus group approach was applied. We involved 188 patients in 22 focus groups. A guide was developed to provoke a discussion among participants of a rehabilitation clinic on the topic of using an online portal with a wide range of telemedicine features (e.g., an exercise module and a teleconference module). Three coders, using thematic analysis, coded the focus group transcripts simultaneously. RESULTS: The focus groups resulted in a wide range of factors that drive or hinder patient acceptance. Facilitators included the possibility to exercise from the comfort of home, the ability to work on one's recovery, irrespective of the time schedule of care professionals, and improved quality of exercise instruction, due to the provision of exercise videos on the portal. Barriers included a lack of intrinsically motivation, experiencing portal-mediated communication with care professionals as 'impersonal', and the lack of physical space and rest to properly exercise at home. Generally speaking, participants were enthusiastic about the idea to provide the telemedicine service as a follow-up treatment as they liked to be in contact with their therapist and to continue training. CONCLUSION: Acceptance of telemedicine services depends on many factors that are not part of well-established theories that explain technology acceptance. These factors are more specific than general determinants, such as ease of use and usefulness, and focus mainly on contextual factors, such as a fit between the service configuration and daily life, personal motivation and the associated psychological burden.

AB  - Purpose To develop a modified version of the spinal function sort (M-SFS) by measuring work-related self-efficacy beliefs in patients with chronic low back pain. Methods A mixed method design consisting of three different methods (M1-3) was performed. In semi-structured interviews participants were asked how often they performed the activities of the 50 SFS items in 1 week, and which spinal postures and movements were associated with their back pain (M1). Quantitative analysis of previously obtained SFS data investigated internal consistency, unidimensionality, item response, and floor and ceiling effect (M2). Experts rated the SFS items based on their relevance (M3). The findings from these methods were used within a final scoring system for item reduction. Results From semi-structured interviews with 17 participants, eight new items emerged (M1). Quantitative analysis of 565 data sets (M2) revealed very high internal consistency of all items (Cronbach's alpha = 0.98) indicating item redundancy; unidimensionality of the SFS was supported by principal component analysis; good item response was confirmed by Rasch analysis; and a floor effect of four items depicting very heavy material handling was found. Experts agreed on 8 out of the 50 SFS as relevant (M3). From the original SFS, 12 items met the predefined summary score of 9. Conclusions A modified version of the SFS with 20 items has been developed. Feasibility, reliability and validity of this modified version must be tested before it can be used in clinical practice.

AB  - Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS] has been in use for four decades for the treatment of pain. The study of this pain control modality has been limited. There have been small randomized studies which have tested older TENS modalities. These studies have had difficulty obtaining adequate results due to unreported drop out rates, small sample sizes, selection bias and study design. A large study with conventional, nu-waveform and acupuncturetype TENS as compared to sham treatment has been lacking. In this study, 324 patients with chronic lower back pain were randomly allocated to receive daily treatment of sham TENS [N = 83], conventional TENS [N = 84], acupuncture TENS [N = 78], or nu-wave TENS [N = 79]. After one month no significant effect of TENS treatment was detected on any of nine indicators of outcome measuring function, motion, or depression. There was a significant omnibus time effect [P < 0.0001] indicating improvement of all patients with time over the first month. There was no significant interactive effects of TENS treatment with time [P < 0.1180]. In this study, 324 patients with chronic low back pain with blinded randomization to one of four treatment groups revealed that TENS therapy is no more effective than placebo.

AB  - People with chronic musculoskeletal pain often experience pain-related fear of movement and avoidance behavior. The Fear-Avoidance model proposes a possible mechanism at least partly explaining the development and maintenance of chronic pain. People who interpret pain during movement as being potentially harmful to the organism may initiate a vicious behavioral cycle by generating pain-related fear of movement accompanied by avoidance behavior and hyper-vigilance.This study investigates whether an individually adapted multifactorial approach comprised of biopsychosocial elements, with a focus on physical exercise, mindfulness, and education on pain and behavior, can decrease work-related fear-avoidance beliefs.As part of a large scale 10-week worksite randomized controlled intervention trial focusing on company initiatives to combat work-related musculoskeletal pain and stress, we evaluated fear-avoidance behavior in 112 female laboratory technicians with chronic neck, shoulder, upper back, lower back, elbow, and hand/wrist pain using the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire at baseline, before group allocation, and again at the post intervention follow-up 10 weeks later.A significant group by time interaction was observed (P \u003c 0.05) for work-related fear-avoidance beliefs. The between-group difference at follow-up was -2.2 (-4.0 to -0.5), corresponding to a small to medium effect size (Cohen\u0027s d = 0.30).Our study shows that work-related, but not leisure time activity-related, fear-avoidance beliefs, as assessed by the Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, can be significantly reduced by 10 weeks of physical-cognitive-mindfulness training in female laboratory technicians with chronic pain.

AB  - Osteoporosis, a disease characterized by skeletal fragility, represents a major health problem, especially for postmenopausal women. This project is a pilot study exploring the female osteoporotic patient's understanding of her individual pain condition and investigating the potential of a structured nursing program, called the Osteoporotic Pain Program (OPP), to increase the patient's insight, skills and motivation to self help, and possibly reduce pain. Findings in other studies and the expertise of experienced clinical nurses formed the basis for the OPP, which consists of three elements: conversations between nurse and patient, pain curves, and body charts. Qualitative interviews, using a semi-structured guide, were conducted to explore the meaning of the program as seen from the perspective of the patients. Participating in the OPP proved meaningful to patients in two major ways, actively exploring one's pain and feeling empowered. The analysis lead to forming a main category, "Exploring the chronic pain situation", and five subcategories were identified: expressing one's pain, understanding one's pain, justifying one's pain, accepting medication, and entering a ready-to-act mode. Findings indicate that the OPP contributes to challenging the patients. Their self-efficacy increases, their actions change, and pain intensity appears to decrease.

AB  - Patients with low back pain (LBP; N = 102), fibromyalgia (FM; N = 100), and headache (HA; N = 100) were asked to describe their pain in their own words, and the words and phrases they used were then classified into 7 global domains (eg, Pain Quality, Pain Magnitude) and as many specific subdomains as needed to capture all of the ideas expressed (eg, under Pain Quality, subdomains such as sharp, achy, and throbbing). Fifteen pain quality subdomains were identified as most common. Nine of these demonstrated significant between-group differences in frequency. For example, patients with FM described their pain as achy more often than patients with LBP or HA; patients with HA described their pain as more throbbing than patients with LBP or FM; and patients with LBP described their pain as more shooting than patients with FM or HA. With the 15 pain quality subdomains representing the universe of most important pain qualities to assess, only 2 of 8 descriptive measures of pain quality were determined to have content validity. The findings are generally consistent with a study that used similar procedures in other patient samples to identify the most common words patients use to describe pain, supporting their generalizability. The findings also support the use of pain quality measures for discriminating between chronic pain conditions. Finally, the findings have important implications for evaluating and modifying pain quality measures as needed.

AB  - Objective: This scoping review aimed to explore the different working definitions for the duration of acute, subacute, and chronic pain , with emphasis on low back pain , and to establish where these definitions originated and the rationale provided for the time frames used. Introduction: From a global perspective, low back pain is a major social and economic problem. One of the most commonly used methods to stratify and manage low back pain is the traditional duration-based classification (acute, subacute, and chronic). Where these time points lie to differentiate these transitions continues to be debated within the scientific community, which may engender a degree of heterogeneity in study findings. Therefore, applying these findings to clinical practice may be somewhat challenging. This review encapsulates the historical origins of the different duration categories to provide an understanding of how these variations were derived. Inclusion criteria: Studies that included participants with low back pain were the focus of this review. Sources that included children or other specific pain pathologies, such as cancer pain , were excluded. The main concept of interest was that the publication proposed an original definition of the duration of acute, subacute, or chronic low back pain. All study designs were included provided they gave a rationale for the duration that they used. Methods: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, from the inception of each database until September 18, 2019. This review was limited to studies published in English. Two independent reviewers screened the retrieved articles against the eligibility criteria. Additional studies were searched from the reference lists of studies to find the original source. Some original sources overlapped with general pain duration literature. This led to a deviation from the scoping review protocol, which originally intended to focus on definitions of low back pain duration only. Data extraction was undertaken using a charting table developed specifically for the review objectives. The findings were presented using narrative synthesis. Results: Nineteen records were included in this review, and comprised three book chapters, four review articles, four articles that arose following pain expert group discussions, seven primary research studies, and a spinal guideline. Data were extracted from the included studies and categorized into four themes based on the origin of the classification of the duration. The themes included i) work/employment setting, ii) empirical studies, iii) expert reasoning, and iv) pathophysiological explanation. Conclusions: This scoping review compiled the existing literature on the working definitions of the duration of acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain and found a wide variation. These ranged from seven days, 14 days, and seven weeks for the acute and subacute transition points, and seven weeks to three years for chronic low back pain. The duration definitions specifically referring to the general pain literature focused on three and/or six months for the transition to chronic. Better integration of reasoning between the identified themes could facilitate the establishment of more ideal duration definitions in the future. Although inconclusive, the definition most commonly cited, with most consensus, was three months for the transition to chronic low back pain.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a partnership between a public university and a regional foodbank aimed to promote health in food insecure communities, and to support nursing students' learning experiences in community health. DESIGN: A single setting case study. METHODS: A comprehensive health needs assessment conducted through a windshield survey and key informant interviews was used to identify the community's priorities. FINDINGS: Nursing interventions were tailored to the community's needs by creating healthy recipes and providing education on food safety, lower back injury prevention, and chronic disease prevention and 15 management. CONCLUSION: During pandemics, nursing program partnerships with food banks could play pivotal roles in community health promotion. CLINICAL EVIDENCE: Food banks can serve as clinical platforms for nursing education and community wellness activities.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite being common early in life and affecting individuals' quality of life to the same degree as neck and low back pain, research into epidemiological aspects of mid-back pain (MBP) has been scarce. The purpose of our systematic review was therefore to describe the incidence and prognosis of MBP in the general population. The PRISMA Statement guided the study process. DATABASES: A systematic search was conducted in CINAHL, PEDro, PsycINFO and Scopus. RESULTS: Of 3194 unique records identified, seven were included in our qualitative synthesis. The 3-month and 2-year incidence proportions of MBP in children and adolescents were approximately 4% and 50%, respectively. In adults, the 1-month incidence proportion was less than 1%. The persistence or recurrence of MBP over a 1- to 4-year period was between 13% and 45% in children and adolescents; a change in spinal pain location over time was common. Individuals reporting MBP have an increased risk of future care seeking compared with people without musculoskeletal complaints. No studies assessing adult MBP recovery trajectories or prognostic factors were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge about the incidence and prognosis of MBP in the general population is limited. The incidence of MBP in children and adolescents seems to be similar to the incidence of neck and low back pain; in adults, it is lower than that of neck and low back pain. Studies investigating recovery trajectories of MBP in adults and prognostic factors for MBP are lacking. WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: The incidence of mid-back pain (MBP) in young individuals is similar to that of neck and low back pain, and <=50% report persistent pain; however, the evidence base is limited. Knowledge about adult trajectories and prognostic factors for MBP is lacking.

AB  - Study Design: A case report containing description of symptoms, signs, and selected treatment in two patients with lumbar disc herniation where the type of herniation changed from contained to noncontained in less than 1 year.Objectives: To demonstrate the difference in clinical appearance related to the type of herniation.Summary Of Background Data: The clinical appearance of lumbar disc herniation regarding onsets of symptoms, severity of pain, and clinical findings are related to the type of herniation, as is the treatment.Methods: Two cases reports are presented with description of anamneses, clinical findings, neuroradiographic findings, and treatment.Results: Both patients suffered from a transient left-side sciatica due to a contained lumbar disc herniation, improved by physiotherapy. After several months, both patients had an instantaneous increase in contralateral leg pain, and the recurrent, intense pain was caused by a sequestration of the previous contained herniation. The neurologic findings were more severe, and the patients were operated on, with subsequent improvement.Conclusions: The case reports illustrate the difference in clinical appearance of disc herniation related to the type of herniation, with a more aggressive clinical appearance in conjunction with perforation of the posterior longitudinal ligament with extrusion of disc material.

AB  - Objectives  Traditional mental health services are not used by a majority of older adults with depression, suggesting a need for new methods of health service delivery. We conducted a pilot study using peer mentors to deliver depression care to older adults in collaboration with a mental health professional. We evaluated the acceptability of peer mentors to older adults and examined patient experiences of the intervention.  Methods  Six peer mentors met 30 patients for 1 hour weekly for 8 weeks. A mental health professional provided an initial clinical evaluation as well as supervision and guidance to peer mentors concurrent with patient meetings. We measured depressive symptoms at baseline and after study completion, and depressive symptoms and working alliance at weekly peer-patient meetings. We also interviewed participants and peer mentors to assess their experiences of the intervention.  Results  Ninety-six percent of patients attended all eight meetings with the peer mentor and PHQ-9 scores decreased for 85% of patients. Patients formed strong, trusting relationships with peer mentors. Patients emphasized the importance of trust, of developing a strong relationship, and of the credibility and communication skills of the peer mentor. Participants described benefits such as feeling hopeful, and reported changes in attitude, behavior, and insight.  Conclusions  Use of peer mentors working in collaboration with a mental health professional is promising as a model of depression care delivery for older adults. Testing of effectiveness is needed and processes of recruitment, role definition, and supervision should be further developed.

AB  - Abstract Objective  The objective of this pilot study was to describe peer communication in meetings with depressed elders, associate their relationship with working alliance and depression and assess congruence of communication with training. Methods  Three peers with a history of depression, in recovery, received 20 h of training in peer mentoring for depression as part of an 8-week pilot program for 23 depressed older adults. Each peer-client meeting was recorded; a sample of 69 recorded meetings were chosen across the program period and coded with the Roter Interaction Analysis System, a validated medical interaction analysis system. Generalized linear mixed models were used to examine peer talk during meetings in relation to working alliance and client depression.  Results  Peers used a variety of skills congruent with their training including client-centered talk, positive rapport building and emotional responsiveness that remained consistent or increased over time. Client-centered communication and positive rapport were associated with increased working alliance and decreased depressive symptoms (all p     Conclusion  Trained peer mentors can use communication behaviors useful to older adults with depression. Specifically, client-centered talk may be important to include in peer training.    Practice implications  Peer mentors can be a valuable resource in providing depression counseling to older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Condition Management Programmes (CMPs), delivered through primary care settings, have been identified as possible vehicles to facilitate return to work for individuals with chronic health problems. There is little research, however, which examines how such programmes are received by patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore patients' experiences of CMPs in terms of health, well-being and employability. METHODS: Four focus groups and nine semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to capture patients' (n = 25) perceptions and experiences regarding participation in one of five different CMPs: Cardiac Rehabilitation, Counselling, Lower Back Pain Services, Smoking Cessation and a GP Exercise Referral Programme. RESULTS: Experiences of the CMPs were generally positive. Respondents reported improved health behaviours (specifically better diets and increased exercise), positive psychosocial outcomes (including increased self-esteem, confidence and social support) and in some cases, return to work. However, concerns were expressed about the shortness of interventions and their accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: Although condition management appears to have been well received by participants, the findings also illustrate that there is no 'one size fits all' template for CMPs. Rather, interventions should be adapted to take account of the dynamics of specific conditions, the context in which the intervention is based and the characteristics of the individuals involved.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a lifelong debilitating condition that presents numerous challenges to social participation. The challenge of finding suitable and functional clothing while living with SCI is one of the frequently overlooked factors hindering attempts at meaningful engagement in social and community life. Two case studies were collected over a period of 4 months through a qualitative interview. Both participants were aging with, and living with long-term spinal compromised conditions and described the relevance of 'off-the-rack' and adaptive apparel to their overall wellbeing, safety, personal style and identity at the threshold of older adulthood. Participants reported problems with adaptive apparel designed specifically for people living with disabilities and also reported problems with off-the-rack clothing that failed to meet needs for durability, comfort, safety, and style. Findings revealed that embodied knowledge was key to the apparel choices regarding function and standards of social acceptability. Implications for social workers and health professionals encourage the acknowledgment of apparel-related issues to meet the standards of client-centered care. Apparel plays a vital role in achieving and maintaining one's identity as a social person, and should not be overlooked for people aging with disabilities.

AB  - Discussions of disability in the gerontological and the disability studies literatures have seldom considered unique perspectives and needs of older adults. Disability has often been stigmatized and viewed as antithetical to successful aging. We call for expansion of prevailing paradigms of disability to address the resilience and continuing human potential of older adults living with disabilities. In addition to recognizing the environmental context of disability, we propose greater attention to adaptive potential of disabled older adults. We discuss 6 types of proactive adaptations that can contribute to empowerment, meaning, enhanced quality of life and psychological well-being among persons living with late-life onset disabilities. These include: (a) helping others, (b) planning for future care, (c) marshaling intergenerational support, (d) self-advocacy for responsive health care, (e) making environmental modifications to improve safety and comfort of the home, and (f) finding strength in spiritual pursuits. Enacting proactive adaptations can contribute to resilience in facing late life impairments and functional limitations. Such efforts can complement utilization of services and obtaining accommodations. Maintaining life satisfaction among older adults living with disabilities also involves focus on transcendent personal goals and acceptance of an altered self. We note how a more integrative view of medical and social dimensions of disability, infused with concepts of human agency, contributes to rapprochement between alternative disciplinary orientations to late life disability. Without negating society\u0027s important responsibilities for accommodating to needs of older adults living with disability, we reaffirm their potential for greater control and self-determination through proactive adaptations.

AB  - Study Design: A subanalysis of data derived from a randomized clinical trial was performed.Objective: To evaluate the association of a patient's expectation for benefit from a specific treatment with improved functional outcome.Summary Of Background Data: Psychosocial factors, ambiguous diagnoses, and lack of a clearly superior treatment have complicated the management of patients with chronic low back pain. The authors hypothesized that patient expectation for benefit from a specific treatment is associated with improved functional outcomes when that treatment is administered.Methods: In a randomized trial, 135 patients with chronic low back pain who received acupuncture or massage were studied. Before randomization, study participants were asked to describe their expectations regarding the helpfulness of each treatment on a scale of 0 to 10. The primary outcome was level of function at 10 weeks as measured by the modified Roland Disability scale.Results: After adjustment for baseline characteristics, improved function was observed for 86% of the participants with higher expectations for the treatment they received, as compared with 68% of those with lower expectations (P = 0.01). Furthermore, patients who expected greater benefit from massage than from acupuncture were more likely to experience better outcomes with massage than with acupuncture, and vice versa (P = 0.03).Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that patient expectations may influence clinical outcome independently of the treatment itself. In contrast, general optimism about treatment, divorced from a specific treatment, is not strongly associated with outcome. These results may have important implications for clinical trial design and recruitment, and may help to explain the apparent success of some conventional and alternative therapies in trials that do not control for patient expectations. The findings also may be important for therapy choices made in the clinical setting.

AB  - Introduction: In the United States, access to microprocessor-controlled prosthetic ankles is limited to patients with lower-limb loss classified as unlimited community ambulators or greater. However, the potential benefits of these devices have not been evaluated among patients classified as household or limited community ambulators. This study examined the benefit of hydraulic- and microprocessor-controlled prosthetic ankles for patients classified as limited community ambulators. Materials and Methods: Four different treatment configurations were evaluated using a randomized crossover study design. These four configurations included the participant's current flexible keel (FK) prosthetic foot, an energy-storage-and-return foot (ESAR), a hydraulic ankle (HA), and amicroprocessor ankle (MPA). After a 2-week accommodation period, both patient-reported and performance-based outcome measures were recorded for each ankle foot system. A StepWatch activity monitor and two-dimensional video motion analysis were also used to evaluate each system. Results: A single participant meeting the inclusion criteria was recruited. The patient-reportedmobility and socket fit instruments were greatest with the HA system. When assessed on slopes and stairs, the MPA demonstrated benefits on hill ascent and stair descent. In considering the walking speed and perceived exertion jointly, the HA system allowed similar walking speed but lower exertion compared with fixed-ankle systems. The patient-reported low back pain and balance confidence instruments did not provide useful data for interpretation. Two-dimensional videomotion analysis showed that the HA and MPA contributed to improved ankle and knee postures when ascending and descending a slope. The step activity data showed the greatest activity with the HA. Discussion: The results from the outcome measures showed a varying level of benefit across all four of the treatment configurations. Both the HA and MPA had favorable scores in varying performance-based outcome measures, but the HA scored the most favorable in a majority of the patient-reported outcome measures. Conclusion: The results show varying benefits of the microprocessor- and hydraulic-controlled prosthetic components over fixed-ankle ESAR and FK feet, based on both performance-based and patient-reported outcome measures. Further studies are needed to fully evaluate these benefits in larger sample sizes.

Clear radicular pattern could not be elicited. The patient underwent a successful anterior discectomy and fusion with long-term clinical and radiographic results.Conclusion: Patients with congenital insensitivity to pain who develop a cervical disc herniation may present with atypical symptoms not manifesting in the classic radicular pattern. Higher index of suspicion by the clinician must be practiced to make the appropriate diagnosis. Successful surgical outcome may be achieved in these patients.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials was performed. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation for subacute low back pain among working-age adults. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation programs are widely applied for patients with chronic low back pain. The multidisciplinary biopsychosocial approach for prolonged low back pain could be considered to prevent chronicity. Work site visits and a close relationship with occupational health care might produce results in terms of patients working ability. METHODS: Reviewed randomized controlled trials as well as controlled trials were identified from electronic bibliographic databases, reference checking, and consultation with experts in the rehabilitation field. Four blinded reviewers selected the trials. Two rehabilitation specialists evaluated the clinical relevance. Two other blinded reviewers extracted the data and assessed the main results along with the methodologic quality of the studies. A qualitative analysis was performed to evaluate the level evidence. RESULTS: Of 1808 references, only 2 relevant studies were included. Both were considered to be methodologically low-quality randomized controlled trials. The clinical relevance of the studies was sufficient. The level of scientific evidence was moderate, showing that multidisciplinary rehabilitation involving work site visit or more comprehensive occupational health care intervention helps patients return to work faster, makes sick leaves less, and alleviates subjective disability. CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate evidence showing that multidisciplinary rehabilitation for subacute low back pain is effective, and that work site visit increases the effectiveness, but because the analyzed studies had some methodologic shortcomings, an obvious need still exists for high-quality trials in this field.

AB  - Objective: In older adults, major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) are common and mutually exacerbating. We predicted that duloxetine pharmacotherapy and Depression and Pain Care Management (DPCM) would result in (1) significant improvement in MDD and CLBP and (2) significant improvements in health-related quality of life, anxiety, disability, self-efficacy, and sleep quality.Design and Intervention: Twelve week open-label study using duloxetine up to 120 mg/day + DPCM.Setting: Outpatient late-life depression research clinic.Patients: Thirty community-dwelling adults >60 years old.Outcome Measures: Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form (MPQ-SF).Results: 46.7% (n = 14) of the sample had a depression remission. All subjects who met criteria for the depression remission also had a pain response. 93.3% (n = 28) had a significant pain response. Of the subjects who met criteria for a low back pain response, 50% (n = 14) also met criteria for the depression remission. The mean time to depression remission was 7.6 (SE = 0.6) weeks. The mean time to pain response was 2.8 (SE = 0.5) weeks. There were significant improvements in mental health-related quality of life, anxiety, sleep quality, somatic complaints, and both self-efficacy for pain management and for coping with symptoms. Physical health-related quality of life, back pain-related disability, and self-efficacy for physical functioning did not improve.Conclusions: Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like duloxetine delivered with DPCM may be a good choice to treat these linked conditions in older adults. Treatments that target low self-efficacy for physical function and improving disability may further increase response rates.

AB  - PURPOSE: There is a high prevalence of persistent pain following SCI yet insights into its impact and the quality of pain care are limited. We aimed to explore, in-depth, the problem of persistent pain in Australian community-dwelling adults with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Our objectives were to investigate (i) how individuals experience persistent pain, (ii) how they experience pain care and (iii) the concordance between clinical practice guidelines for managing pain and reported care practices. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods convergent parallel study. Adults with SCI and persistent pain completed a survey (n = 43); a subset of participants completed interviews (n = 10). We analysed the data from each method separately and then integrated the findings. RESULTS: Results indicated that the life impact of persistent pain is variable but it can be more disabling than physical impairments and compound a sense of isolation and despair. Community-based management was reported to predominantly have a pharmacological focus, with occurrences of opioid misuse apparent in the data. Access to expert, comprehensive and individualised care was frequently reported as inadequate. CONCLUSION: While some people with SCI and persistent pain can effectively self-manage their pain, for others the impact on quality of life is profound and complex care needs are commonly unmet.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPersistent pain is a common consequence of SCI and profoundly impacts quality of life.Complex pain care needs are commonly unmet. Individuals require regular, comprehensive, biopsychosocial assessment. The effectiveness of pain management strategies must be monitored on an ongoing basis.Opportunities for personal self-management support must be available long-term.

AB  - People live longer and pain-related conditions become more common in old age. Since there are many confounding factors related to pain treatment in older people, concerns have been raised regarding the management of pain. Pharmacokinetic and pharmadynamic changes that occur with normal ageing, common multimorbidity and polypharmacy may all increase the risk of inappropriate use of pain medication. A better understanding of pain and its treatment can assist in achieving the goals of optimizing pain management in this age group. This study aimed to determine the pattern of analgesic use, the persistence of chronic pain, and factors related to mobility limitation in community-dwelling older Finns. In addition, older persons’ perceptions of whether they hoped to receive more attention from the physician in the management of their pain were explored. This study utilized the data collected in the population-based Geriatric Multidisciplinary Strategy for the Good Care of Elderly (GeMS). The GeMS was conducted in 2004–2007 and the participants (n=1000) aged 75 years and living in Kuopio, Finland, were randomly selected from the population register of Kuopio. The participants were randomized to intervention (n=500) and control (n=500) groups, and both groups were interviewed annually by study nurses to assess health status and drug use. Those subjects in the intervention group underwent an annual comprehensive geriatric assessment including physician’s examination with medication assessment, physiotherapist’s counselling and a nutritionist’s appointment if needed. Musculoskeletal chronic pain is often persistent, i.e. the majority of those participants with pain at baseline suffered from it also after two follow-up years. Almost half of the community-dwelling older participants were using analgesics and analgesic drugs were most commonly taken on an as needed rather than on a daily basis. Females were more commonly analgesic users than men, and paracetamol was the most commonly taken analgesic drug. The risk of mobility limitation was highest among analgesic users with pain and it was associated with older age, poor overall health, living alone, sedentary lifestyle and poor muscle strength. Almost half of older people with musculoskeletal chronic pain hoped that the physician would be paying more attention to the management of their pain. This study showed that there is an evident need for better pain management in community-dwelling older people. Regular pain assessments, evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment, and developing new strategies to manage pain are needed to optimize pain treatment. In addition, adjuvant therapy with nonpharmacological approaches should be encouraged to supplement pharmacological pain management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is an important health problem Sri Lankan males. AIM: To determine the association between low back pain and posture, exercise, family history, level of education, level of income, smoking, consumption of alcohol and animal proteins. METHODS: A case control study was carried out among 166 cases (patients with low back pain) and 196 controls (without low back pain). Data was collected using a pretested structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, enquiring about demographic data and details of risk factors. Heights and weights were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Age range was 18-85 years. Mean age (SD) for cases was 47.8 (16) years. Mean age (SD) for controls was 42.6 (17) years. Bad posture (odds ration [OR] = 107.4), lack of exercise (OR = 16.4), positive family history (OR = 42.3), moderate education (OR = 1.8), daily alcohol consumption (OR = 2.4) and not consuming animal proteins (OR = 4.6) were significant risk factors for low back pain. BMI, level of income and smoking did not have a significant association with low back pain. CONCLUSION: Posture, exercise, family history, level of education, consumption of animal proteins and consumption of alcohol had significant associations with low back pain. Most risk factors were similar to other countries. However, being marginally over weight and smoking regularly were not significantly associated with low back pain.

AB  - Background: Factors that influence a patient's decision for spinal surgery and selection of the spine surgeon have not been studied in the context of a Second Opinion (SO). Providing insight into these factors will guide surgeons in their discussion of treatment options with patients.Objective: This study aims to assess the impact of a discordant SO on the final decision of patients as compared to their initial preference regarding spinal disc disease treatment for chronic neck and low back pain.Patient Involvement: Patients in this study engage in clinical vignettes designed to induce decisional conflict.Methods: A cross-sectional study using clinical vignette-based questionnaires was presented to patients at the Family Medicine, Orthopedic, and Neurosurgery clinics at a university-based tertiary academic medical center.Results: A total of 246 patients participated in the study (response rate, 66.8%). Irrespective of the initial offered treatment, most patients wanted to consult a SO (64.2%). Most patients preferred conservative treatment to surgery after getting the initial recommendation (78.5%) and after getting a discordant SO (56.5%). There was an association between the agreement of the patient with the initial recommendation and the effect of the SO on the final decision of patients (p < 0.001). Patients who disagreed with the initially offered treatment were more likely to abide by their initial decision after the SO (80.8%) as compared to those who were in agreement (17.7%), while those who agreed with the initially offered treatment were more likely to change their decision (39.5%) or to take a third opinion (42.9%).Discussion: A discordant SO may validate patients' wishes when they disagree with the initially offered treatment and may lead to confusion when they agree with the initial physicians' recommendations.Practical Value: As patients tend to abide by their initial preference, physicians should explicitly consider patients' wishes when discussing options for management of spinal disc disease.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain has major clinical and social consequences. Few studies have examined any variation in the extent of impairment on quality of life and work productivity by site and type of chronic pain. Objective: The objective of our study is to examine adverse impacts of chronic pain on physical and psychological health and work productivity. Methods: Our community-population study was based on a phone-interview of adults with chronic pain, residing in Olmsted County, MN. Chronic pain groups were categorized into abdominal pain, back pain, joint pain, multisite pain, neuropathic pain or no chronic pain. We used standardized instruments, including the Brief Pain Inventory, the Patients Health Questionnair-9, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire. Results: We evaluated 591 patients suffering from chronic pain and 150 participants with no chronic pain. Almost one third of patients with multisite pain (33%) and neuropathic pain (32%) reported mild/major depressive symptoms. Patients suffering from chronic pain, particularly from multisite pain and neuropathic pain, reported significant pain interferences with daily activities and impairments in physical function. Chronic pain was significantly associated with reduced performance at work but not with missed work hours. The average reported reduction in work productivity ranged from 2.4 hours (+/-5.6) per week for adults with joint chronic pain to 9.8 hours (+/-11.1) per week for adults with multisite chronic pain. Conclusions: Chronic pain, particularly multisite pain and neuropathic pain, significantly affected physical and psychological health. Chronic pain is a multifaceted health condition that requires a multidisciplinary treatment approach.

AB  - The pervasiveness of chronic low back pain and its subsequent disability are alarming in today's healthcare. Although literature is beginning to explicate the impact of self-management (SM) and self-management support (SMS) in other chronic illnesses, there remains limited understanding on whether SM and SMS influence functional ablement in chronic low back pain patients. This study examined whether SM and SMS significantly influenced functional ablement after controlling for mental state and demographic characteristics, examined whether SM mediated the SMS-functional ablement relationship, and described patient perceptions of their SM, SMS, and functional ablement. The adapted Chronic Care Model guided this study.A non-experimental, cross-sectional, descriptive design utilizing mediation analysis and qualitative content analysis addressed the study purposes. Through convenience sampling, 110 participants were recruited from two pain centers employing multimodal pain management. Findings showed lack of significant statistical influence of SM and SMS on functional ablement in chronic low back pain patients. Through mediation approach, SM and SMS were strongly correlated, however, other required regression equations were not significant. Therefore, SM did not mediate the SMS-functional ablement relationship. This maybe related to several factors including the possibility that participants had better-managed pain and functional ablement levels in the pain centers.Participant responses to the open-ended questions provided significant themes. Taking medications and maintaining physical activity were dominant SM activities. Major participant- perceived SMS activities were prescribing medications, providing treatments other than medications, and giving encouragement. Participants' concerns regarding their functional ablement centered on anxiety and fear.This study assisted in advancing knowledge and contributing towards understanding SM, SMS, and functional ablement in chronic low back pain. Findings are important to the health of individuals and families affected by the chronic low back pain epidemic. It is important to continue to engage patients and healthcare providers in SM and SMS.The adapted Chronic Care Model needs further evaluation to enlighten nursing science with potential significance to clinical practice. More exploration is necessary to assess the influences of SM and SMS towards improving outcomes in the complex care of chronic low back pain. Findings support a step towards experimental research in the future employing SM and SMS interventions.

AB  - Purpose This study utilized a nonexperimental, cross-sectional, descriptive design to examine self-management (SM), self-management support (SMS), and other pain-related variables in chronic low back pain (CLBP), and described participants' perceptions of their SM, SMS, and functional ablement. Data sources Data were collected from 120 participants in four primary care clinics using survey measures. Conclusions SMS was found to significantly influence SM and mental health. Overall health significantly influenced functional ablement and pain intensity. Participants described using medications, exercising, and making lifestyle changes as most common SM strategies. Prescribing medications, giving encouragement, and providing information were main participant-perceived SMS activities. Depression and anxiety were key responses to perceptions on functional ablement. Implications for practice Study findings increase our understanding of the SM, SMS, and functional ablement of CLBP patients with relevance to application in practice. There is a great need to develop evidence-based SM and SMS programs specific to CLBP patients' needs. Nurses and nurse practitioners play major roles in leading this initiative. Study findings also reinforce the importance of psychologists and physical therapists' collaboration in the complex care of CLBP. Longitudinal and experimental studies are recommended to evaluate SM and SMS programs that include physical therapy and psychological care components.

AB  - There has been growing interest in psychologically oriented pain management over the past 3 to 4 decades, including a 2011 description of psychologically informed practice (PIP) for low back pain. PIP requires a broader focus than traditional biomechanical and pathology-based approaches that have been traditionally used to manage musculoskeletal pain. A major focus of PIP is addressing the behavioral aspects of pain (ie, peoples' responses to pain) by identifying individual expectations, beliefs, and feelings as prognostic factors for clinical and occupational outcomes indicating progression to chronicity. Since 2011, the interest in PIP seems to be growing, as evidenced by its use in large trials, inclusion in scientific conferences, increasing evidence base, and expansion to other musculoskeletal pain conditions. Primary care physicians and physical therapists have delivered PIP as part of a stratified care approach involving screening and targeting of treatment for people at high risk for continued pain-associated disability. Furthermore, PIP is consistent with recent national priorities emphasizing nonpharmacological pain management options. In this perspective, PIP techniques that range in complexity are described, considerations for implementation in clinical practice are offered, and future directions that will advance the understanding of PIP are outlined.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: chronic low back pain (CLBP) adversely affects many quality of life components, and is reported to impair sleep. The aim of this review was to determine the association between CLBP and sleep. METHODS: this review comprised 3 phases: an electronic database search (PubMed, Cinahl Plus, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Pedro, and Cochrane Library) identified potential articles; these were screened for inclusion criteria by 2 independent reviewers; extraction of data from accepted articles; and rating of internal validity by 2 independent reviewers and strength of the evidence using valid and reliable scales. RESULTS: the search generated 17 articles that fulfilled the inclusion criteria (quantitative n=14 and qualitative n=3). CLBP was found to relate to several dimensions of sleep including: sleep disturbance and duration (n=15), sleep affecting day-time function (n=5), sleep quality (n=4), sleep satisfaction and distress (n=4), sleep efficiency (n=4), ability to fall asleep (n=3), and activity during sleep (n=3). Consistent evidence found that CLBP was associated with greater sleep disturbance; reduced sleep duration and sleep quality; increased time taken to fall asleep; poor day-time function; and greater sleep dissatisfaction and distress. Inconsistent evidence was found that sleep efficiency and activity were adversely associated with CLBP. DISCUSSION: many dimensions of sleep are adversely associated with CLBP. Management strategies for CLBP need to address these to maximize quality of life in this patient cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of low-income minority adults taking part in a yoga dosing trial for chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with nineteen participants recruited from a randomized yoga dosing trial for predominantly low-income minority adults with chronic low back pain. Interviews discussed the impact of yoga on low back pain and emotions; other perceived advantages or disadvantages of the intervention; and facilitators and barriers to practicing yoga. Interviews were audio taped and transcribed, coded using ATLAS.ti software, and analyzed with inductive and deductive thematic analysis methods. SETTING: Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA. RESULTS: Participants viewed yoga as a means of pain relief and attributed improved mood, greater ability to manage stress, and enhanced relaxation to yoga. Overall, participants felt empowered to self-manage their pain. Some found yoga to be helpful in being mindful of their emotions and accepting of their pain. Trust in the yoga instructors was a commonly cited facilitator for yoga class attendance. Lack of time, motivation, and fear of injury were reported barriers to yoga practice. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga is a multidimensional treatment for low back pain that has the potential to favorably impact health in a predominantly low-income minority population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency is a relatively common occurrence in patients presenting for spinal surgery; however, whether this abnormality has any effect on spinal fusion outcomes remains unclear. We performed a systematic review of the available literature relevant to the association between vitamin D deficiency and spinal fusion outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic and critical review of recent literature following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus. Key search terms were "vitamin D," "spinal surgery outcomes," "spinal fusion," and "pseudarthrosis." Papers included in the review were original research articles in peer-reviewed journals. The articles were thoroughly examined and compared on the basis of study design, outcomes, and results. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies were included in the qualitative analysis. In these studies, patients presenting with vitamin D deficiency achieved lower fusion rates and suffered higher rates of recurrent-persistent low back pain compared with patients with normal vitamin D levels. Studies examining the effect of postoperative vitamin D supplementation in deficient patients reported significant improvements in low back pain intensity, patient-reported outcomes scores, and fusion rates compared with baseline as well as with control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The literature suggests that patients presenting for spinal fusion may benefit from correction of vitamin D deficiency to maximize the chance of a successful arthrodesis and to achieve optimal surgical outcomes. Future prospective studies are needed to determine whether routine preoperative treatment of this metabolic derangement is warranted.

AB  - Objective: This study evaluated whether tailored cognitive–behavioral therapy (TCBT) that incorporated preferences for learning specific cognitive and/or behavioral skills and used motivational enhancement strategies would improve treatment engagement and participation compared with standard CBT (SCBT). We hypothesized that participants receiving TCBT would show a lower dropout rate, attend more sessions, and report more frequent intersession pain coping skill practice than those receiving SCBT. We also hypothesized that indices of engagement and adherence would correlate with pre- to posttreatment changes in outcome factors. Method: One hundred twenty-eight of 161 consenting persons with chronic back pain who completed baseline measures were allocated to either TCBT or SCBT using a modified randomization procedure. Participants completed daily ratings of pain coping skill practice and goal accomplishment during treatment, as well as measures of pain severity, disability, and other key outcomes at the end of treatment. Results: No significant differences between treatment groups were noted on measures of treatment engagement or adherence. However, these factors were significantly related to some pre- to posttreatment improvements in outcomes, regardless of treatment condition. Conclusions: Participants in this study evidenced a high degree of participation and adherence, but treatment tailored to take into account participant preferences, and that employed motivational enhancement strategies, failed to increase treatment participation over and above SCBT for chronic back pain. Evidence that participation and adherence were associated with positive outcomes supports continued clinical and research efforts focusing on these therapeutic processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People with arthritis are at risk of work disability. Job accommodation and educational programs delivered before imminent work loss can minimize work disability, yet are not currently being widely implemented. The Work-It Study is a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a problem solving program delivered by physical and occupational therapy practitioners to prevent work loss over a two-year period among people with arthritis and rheumatological conditions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol of the randomized controlled trial, and describe the baseline characteristics of the subjects and their work outcomes. METHODS: 287 participants were recruited from the Boston area in Massachusetts, USA. Eligible participants were aged between 21-65, self-reported a physicians' diagnosis of arthritis, rheumatic condition, or chronic back pain, reported a concern about working now or in the near future due to your health, worked at least 15 hours a week, had plans to continue working, and worked or lived in Massachusetts. Subjects were recruited through community sources and rheumatology offices. Participants in the experimental group received a structured interview and an education and resource packet, while participants in the control received the resource packet only. The baseline characteristics and work related outcomes of the participants were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the Work-It Study is the largest and most diverse randomized controlled trial to date aiming to identify and problem solve work-related barriers, promote advocacy, and foster work disability knowledge among people with chronic disabling musculoskeletal conditions. Despite advances in medical management of arthritis and other rheumatological and musculoskeletal conditions, many people still have concerns about their ability to remain employed and are seeking strategies to help them sustain employment.

AB  - Aims and Objectives: Aims and objectives of the study were to study the effectiveness of Raj-yoga meditation and pranayama in patients with myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome (MPDS) and compared the effects with ongoing conventional noninvasive treatment modalities. Materials and Methods: The study comprised 30 patients divided equally (10 each) into 3 group, i.e., control group (conventional, noninvasive treatment), Experimental A group (conventional, noninvasive treatment with raj-yoga meditation therapy and pranayama), and Experimental B group (Raj-yoga meditation therapy and pranayama only). Parameters such as pain, mouth opening, mandibular deviation, inflammation, swelling, clicking, occlusion, and psychologic evaluation such as anxiety, stress, and depression were assessed before the start of the study and at weekly intervals for 3 months. Results: Posttreatment pain and inflammation improved both in the control group and Experimental A group, but statistically it is highly significant in the Experimental A group. Furthermore, it is effective immediately as well as for a long period in Experimental A group. Improvement in mouth opening was statistically highly significant in control group but not in the experimental groups. Posttreatment anxiety and stress status was improved with statistically highly significant result in the Experimental A and B. The posttreatment depression status along with mandibular deviation, swelling, clicking, and occlusion has not improved significantly in any of the groups. Interpretation and Conclusion: Raj-yoga meditation and pranayama in combination with conventional, noninvasive, treatment modalities showed promising results in MPDS patients as compared to either modalities alone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) arises when arthritic changes of the cervical spine cause compression and a progressive injury to the spinal cord. It is common and potentially disabling. People with DCM have among the lowest quality of life scores (Short Form Health Survey-36 item [SF-36]) of chronic disease, although the drivers of the imapact of DCM are not entirely understood. DCM research faces a number of challenges, including the heterogeneous reporting of study data. The AO Spine Research OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to qualitatively explore the patient-reported outcomes in DCM to improve understanding of patient perspective and assist the organization of outcomes into domains for the consensus process. METHODS: Focus group sessions were hosted in collaboration with Myelopathy.org, a charity and support group for people with DCM. A 40-minute session was audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Two authors familiarized themselves with the data and then performed data coding independently. Codes were grouped into themes and a thematic analysis was performed guided by Braun and Clarke's 6-phase approach. The themes were subsequently reviewed with an independent stakeholder with DCM, assisting in the process of capturing the true context and importance of themes. RESULTS: Five people with DCM (3 men and 2 women) participated in the focus group session. The median age was 53 years, and the median score on the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale was 11 (interquartile range 9.5-11.5), indicating the participants had moderate to severe DCM. A total of 54 codes were reviewed and grouped into 10 potential themes that captured the impact of the disability on people with DCM: acceptance of symptoms, anticipatory anxiety, coping mechanisms/resilience, feelings of helplessness, financial consequences, lack of recognition, mental health impact, loss of life control, social reclusiveness and isolation, and social stigma. CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative analysis of the perspectives of people with DCM has highlighted a number of prevailing themes currently unmeasured in clinical research or care. The determinants of low quality of life in DCM are currently unknown, and these findings provide a novel and so far, unique perspective. Continued inclusion of online communities and use of targeted digital software will be important in establishing a consensus-based COS for patients with DCM that is inclusive of all relevant stakeholders including people with DCM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The often slow onset of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the initially partially unspecific symptoms (back pain) and the scarcity of resources in rheumatological care are important factors leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment of these mostly young patients in Germany. Qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology might improve quality of care by providing medical services delegated by the rheumatologists. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate whether qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology can interpret anamnestic and clinical findings such as rheumatologists in patients with chronic low back pain and still unclear diagnosis using a structured questionnaire. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the multicenter PredAS study a structured anamnestic questionnaire was applied independently by qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology and rheumatologists to patients referred to rheumatology practices with the leading symptom of low back pain. The questionnaire covered basic demographic data, medical history and patient reported outcomes. Additionally, measurements of physical function using the Bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index (BASFI) and spinal mobility using the Bath ankylosing spondylitis metrology index (BASMI) were standardized. In order to test the possible facilitation by using digital media, the results of two patient groups were separately documented on paper-based report forms and on an i-pad. Concordance between documentation by qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology and rheumatologists was studied by calculating Cohen's kappa, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and percentage agreement on an individual patient level. RESULTS: Nearly 75% of the 141 patients with chronic low back pain were identified as having the characteristics of inflammatory back pain. The concordance of the documentation for the anamnesis of back pain by qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology and physicians was higher than for the localization of the back pain. The results for the BASMI showed no differences between qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology and physicians (ICC 0.925, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.879-0.953). The time taken for the structured documentation was 20+/- 6.7min for physicians and 28.5+/- 13min for qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that well-trained qualified nurses specialized in rheumatology have a high potential to take over some of the workload from rheumatologists during documentation of the anamnesis and the initial physical examination in the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.

AB  - Background: Schmorls node (SN) are mostly asymptomatic and incidental findings on MRI. However, sometimes they present like acute onset low back pain or acute exacerbation of chronic back pain after minor trauma.Case Presentation: We present rare case of symptomatic infected SN in 67 years female patient presented with complains of low back pain radiating to right buttock. After initial conservative treatment failed subsequent imaging showed significant increase in size of lesion with focal signal changes in disc space gave suspicion of underlying secondary pathology. Patient operated for complete excision of lesion. Histopathological report was suggestive of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis. Patient improved well postoperatively.Conclusion: Most of the time acute SN responds well to conservative treatment; however rapid deterioration of symptoms or persistent severe pain should give suspicion of underlying secondary pathology.

AB  - Context: A simulated horseback riding (SHR) exercise is effective for improvement of pain and functional disability, but its comparative effectiveness with the other is unknown. Objective: The authors aimed to demonstrate the effect of a SHR exercise in people with chronic low back pain. Design: A randomized controlled trial. Settings: Community and university campus. Participants: A total of 48 participants with chronic low back pain were divided into 2 groups, and SHR exercises (n = 24) or stabilization (STB) exercises (n = 24) were performed. Interventions: The exercises were performed for 30 minutes, 2 days per week for 8 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Numeric rating scale, functional disabilities (Oswestry disability index and Roland–Morris disability), and fear-avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ) scores were measured at baseline and at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months. Results: A 2-way repeated analysis of variance identified that between-group comparisons showed significant differences in the FABQ related to work scale (F = 21.422; P =.01). There were no significant differences in the numeric rating scale (F = 1.696; P =.21), Oswestry disability index (F = 1.848; P =.20), Roland–Morris disability (F = 0.069; P =.80), and FABQ related to physical scale (F = 1.579; P =.24). In within-group comparisons, both groups presented significant differences in numeric rating scale (both SHR and STB after 4 wk), Oswestry disability index (both SHR and STB after 6 mo), and Roland–Morris disability (SHR after 6 mo and STB after 8 wk) compared with baseline values. In FABQ-related physical (SHR after 4 wk) and work scales (SHR after 6 mo), there were only significant differences in the SHR compared with baseline values. Conclusions: SHR exercise for 8 weeks had a greater effect than STB exercise for reducing work-related FABQ. The SHR exercise performed in a seated position could substantially decrease pain-related fear disability in young adults with chronic low back pain.

AB  - Although health beliefs have been correlated with self-care adherence in other chronic conditions, little is known about skin care beliefs after spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify the skin care beliefs of individuals with SCI. The conceptual framework was the Health Belief Model (HBM), which proposes that adherence to a health regimen is motivated by beliefs about susceptibility, severity, barriers, benefits, and self-efficacy. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 22 people with SCI. Content analysis of data collected using semistructured questions was used to identify domains of skin care beliefs, including HBM components. Themes that emerged about skin care beliefs included taking vigilant care, taking charge, maintaining health, and passing up care. Although most participants believed they were susceptible to pressure ulcers and preventive care was important, paradoxical statements about beliefs and preventive behaviors were common. These incongruent responses may reflect ambivalence about competing priorities or the efficacy of preventive practices. Further research is needed to understand this phenomenon. Increased understanding of skin care beliefs will assist in developing tailored teaching programs for people with SCI.

AB  - This study assessed the differential prevalence rates of psychopathology in chronic and acute low back pain patients. Psychopathology was assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-III-R (SCID). The results showed that chronic low back pain patients (n=90), had much higher rates of psychopathology than did patients in the acute back pain group (n=90), and much higher than general population base rates. In particular, chronic low back pain patients had high rates of major depression, substance abuse, and personality disorders. Moreover, the chronic low back patients also had high rates of premorbid psychopathology. It was concluded that psychopathology is a major concomitant of chronic low pack pain, and that treating the psychological problems, along with the physical aspects of the chronic low back pain may increase the patient's chance of a successful therapeutic outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical reports of the national pension insurance are essential for the national pension regulatory authority to decide on granting services regarding participation as well as retirement pensions due to inability to work. There are guidelines regarding the content of medical reports. It is also generally accepted that the evaluation of functioning is an essential component of them. However, it is still an open question to what extent the standardisation and the objectiveness of medical reports can be improved. The ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) is a framework as well as a common language for describing functioning and disability. ICF Core Sets are lists of disease-specific relevant ICF categories and can be a useful practicable tool for medical reports for national pension insurance. They could support the standardization of the medical reports. The aim of this planned project is to examine whether the ICF Core Sets for low back pain and chronic widespread pain could serve as a useful basis for medical reports for national pension insurance regarding the patients suffering low back pain or chronic widespread pain. METHOD: Six hundred medical reports from patients with low back pain or chronic widespread pain, respectively, will be translated into the language of the ICF using a retrospective qualitative study design. For this translation ('linking') process specialised physicians from the national pension insurance and members of the Institute for Health and Rehabilitations Science will be trained to use established linking rules. STATE OF THE PROJECT: Currently, a total of 244 medical reports from the national pension insurance with the health conditions low back pain or chronic widespread pain were selected by members of the national pension insurance. The medical reports are anonymised in different federal states according to the appropriate requirements. The first 10 medical reports have already being analysed. OUTLOOK: First analyses show that the structure of medical reports varies enormously. Therefore a comparison of the content without having a common basis is hardly possible. This demonstrates the importance of the project and the possible usefulness of the ICF and the ICF Core Sets for structuring the content of medical reports for the national pension insurance.

AB  - The assessment of addiction-related outcomes is crucial to the management of chronic pain with opioid drugs in all patients. Pain management for patients who have concomitant drug abuse or addiction issues is a particularly complex task involving a need for a common nomenclature as well as empirically derived data to support management strategies during treatment regimens. Complicating the issue is the notion of pseudoaddiction, which is an abuse of medications driven by unrelieved pain that appears on the surface to be very similar to the behavior patterns of addicts. For proper adherence to medical therapy and safety during treatment, it is necessary to address and manage substance abuse-related behaviors. Aberrant drug-taking behavior presents many threats to the integrity of pain treatment. Unfortunately, the current state of the art still has a long way to go before clear guidelines for treatment and management can emerge. What is ultimately needed is a broad-based spectrum of research that highlights the epidemiology of drug-taking behaviors for different medical illnesses ranging from cancer to back pain. This article focuses on some of these issues as well as recounting attempts by our research group to address these issues systematically in hopes of shedding light on the nature of abuse issues in the medically ill. Although advances have been made, there is a definite need for large-scale studies that address the issues of identification and treatment of aberrant behavior in medically ill patients in the effort to provide the best possible outcomes for patients with chronic pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little information exists about current patient perceptions of medical mistakes in ambulatory care within a diverse population. We aimed to learn about the perceptions of medical mistakes, what factors were associated with perceived mistakes, and whether the participants changed physicians because of these perceived mistakes. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 7 primary care practices in North Carolina of English- or Spanish-speaking adults, aged 18 years and older, who saw a health care professional during 2008. Main outcome measures were 4 questions about patient perceptions of medical mistakes in the ambulatory care setting, including (1) overall experience with a medical mistake; type of mistake, such as a (2) diagnostic mistake or (3) treatment mistake, and its associated harm; and (4) effect of this mistake on changing physicians. RESULTS: Of 1697 participants, 265 (15.6%) responded that a physician had made a mistake, 227 (13.4%) reported a wrong diagnosis, 212 (12.5%) reported a wrong treatment, and 239 (14.1%) reported having changed physicians because of a mistake. Participants perceived mistakes and harm in both diagnostic care and medical treatment. Patients with chronic back pain, higher educational attainment, and poor physical health were at increased odds of perceiving mistakes, whereas African American patients were less likely to perceive mistakes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients perceived mistakes in their diagnostic and treatment care in the ambulatory setting. These perceptions had a concrete effect on the physician-patient relationship, often leading patients to seek another health care professional.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of chronic low back pain (LBP) in older North Carolinians, describe their health and health care utilization, and compare these findings with younger subgroups. METHOD: A cross-sectional, telephone survey of 5,357 households was conducted to identify 732 adults with chronic, impairing LBP. RESULTS: Chronic LBP prevalence in older adults was significantly higher than the 21-to-44-year age group (12.3% vs. 6.5%, p < .001). Older adults were more disabled, had longer symptom duration, and were less depressed. Chronic LBP care seeking in older adults was significantly lower than the 45-to-64-year age group (80.6% vs. 88.6%, p = .02). Older adults were less likely to receive bed rest, spinal manipulation, heat/cold treatments, electrical stimulation, and massage therapy. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, strong narcotics, and antidepressants was significantly lower in the older age group. DISCUSSION: There are age-related differences in health and health care use among individuals with chronic LBP.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a Web-based touch-screen computer questionnaire as a data collection method for patients experiencing chronic low back pain in a tertiary spine clinic. Participants completed the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index, SF-36, and Beck Depression Inventory using a touch-screen computer. The time taken to complete the questionnaire was recorded electronically (M = 27.4 minutes; SD = 13.8). Prior computer experience and perceptions of computer use were also assessed. Low back pain was evaluated before and after completing the touch-screen computer questionnaire. Observations of sitting and standing tolerances were made. Participants completed a nine-item paper-and-pencil satisfaction survey after completing the computer questionnaire. Overall satisfaction level with this mode of data collection was high, supporting a larger study using touch-screen technology in patients with chronic low back pain. Important factors influencing satisfaction were the computer environment, ease of use, security, and the ability to interrupt the questionnaire process to allow for changes in sitting or standing posture.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure changes in pain and disability for chronic low-back pain patients receiving treatment with medication-assisted manipulation (MAM) and to compare these to changes in a group only receiving spinal manipulation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 68 chronic low-back pain patients. METHODS: Outcomes were measured using the 1998 Version 2.0 American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons/Council of Musculoskeletal Specialty Societies/Council of Spine Societies Outcomes Data Collection Instruments. The primary outcome variable was change in pain and disability. All patients received an initial 4- to 6-week trial of spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), after which 42 patients received supplemental intervention with MAM and the remaining 26 patients continued with SMT. RESULTS: Low back pain and disability measures favored the MAM group over the SMT-only group at 3 months (adjusted mean difference of 4.4 points on a 100-point scale, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.2 to 11.0). This difference attenuated at 1 year (adjusted mean difference of 0.3 points, 95% CI -8.6 to 9.2). The relative odds of experiencing a 10-point improvement in pain and disability favored the MAM group at 3 months (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.3-13.6) and at 1 year (odds ratio 1.9, 95% CI 0.6-6.5). CONCLUSION: Medication-assisted manipulation appears to offer some patients increased improvement in low back pain and disability. Further investigation of these apparent benefits in a randomized clinical trial is warranted.

AB  - Purpose: Mild depression has been shown as a precursor and as a consequence of low back pain, even in early phases of acute or subacute pain. Chronic daily life stress as well as dysfunctional pain-related cognitions such as thought suppression (TS) seem to play a role in the pain-depression cycle; however, the mechanisms of these associations are less understood. Experimentally induced TS, conceived as the attempt to directly suppress sensations such as pain, has been shown to paradoxically cause a delayed and non-volitional return of the suppressed thoughts and sensations and to increase affective distress. These dysfunctional processes are supposed to increase under high cognitive load, such as high stress.Method: In the present cross-sectional study, we for the first time sought to examine a possible interaction between habitual TS and stress on depression in <italic>N</italic> = 177 patients with subacute low back pain (SLBP), using the following questionnaires: Subscale Thought Suppression from Avoidance-Endurance Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, and Kiel Interview of Subjective Situation. A three-way ANOVA was conducted with two groups of TS (high/low), stress (high/low) and sex as independent factors and depression as dependent.Results: Results indicated a significant three-way interaction with highest depression scores in female patients showing high TS and high stress. Overall main effects for sex and stress indicated higher depression in women and in highly stressed patients.Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that TS heightens depressive mood under conditions of high cognitive load especially in female patients with SLBP indicating a special vulnerability for depressive mood in women with SLBP.

AB  - The surgical management of pilonidal disease ranges from minimally invasive techniques to wide excision with secondary wound healing. Hypothetical counterarguments for using the minimally invasive techniques are that these techniques only incompletely remove the sinus tract and that they allow the formation of subcutaneous cavities as a result of rapid closure of small skin incisions. In order to avoid these problems we used a vessel loop drainage after subcutaneous destruction of the sinus tract. In this technique we combined two procedures: a narrow excision of pilonidal orifices with the subcutaneous destruction of the sinus tract and the removal of hair as well as the long-term vessel loop drainage of the wound channel with repeated revisions of the wound channel for removing hair remnants. In order to assess the efficacy and morbidity of this method 5 patients with primary symptomatic pilonidal sinus underwent an operation as a pilot study. Up to the removal of the vessel loop the wound channel had been regularly inspected using a mosquito clamp. If during two successive inspections no hair from the wound was found the vessel loop was removed. No adverse events occurred such as abscess or recurrent pilonidal sinus. One female patient with a history of long-term use of morphine derivatives and psychotropic substances experienced persistent coccygeal pain that persisted longer than 6 weeks. The complete wound healing with the formation of a qualitative scar took place on the 21st postoperative day (for 3 patients) and on the 28th postoperative day (for 2 patients). Initial results suggest that this operation is an effective procedure for the treatment of primary simple pilonidal sinus disease and we will continue to systematically test it.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective treatments for various conditions such as obesity, cardiac heart diseases, or low back pain require not only personal on-site coaching sessions by health care experts but also a significant amount of home exercises. However, nonadherence to home exercises is still a serious problem as it leads to increased costs due to prolonged treatments. OBJECTIVE: To improve adherence to home exercises, we propose, implement, and assess the novel coaching concept of hybrid ubiquitous coaching (HUC). In HUC, health care experts are complemented by a conversational agent (CA) that delivers psychoeducation and personalized motivational messages via a smartphone, as well as real-time exercise support, monitoring, and feedback in a hands-free augmented reality environment. METHODS: We applied HUC to the field of physiotherapy and conducted 4 design-and-evaluate loops with an interdisciplinary team to assess how HUC is perceived by patients and physiotherapists and whether HUC leads to treatment adherence. A first version of HUC was evaluated by 35 physiotherapy patients in a lab setting to identify patients' perceptions of HUC. In addition, 11 physiotherapists were interviewed about HUC and assessed whether the CA could help them build up a working alliance with their patients. A second version was then tested by 15 patients in a within-subject experiment to identify the ability of HUC to address adherence and to build a working alliance between the patient and the CA. Finally, a 4-week n-of-1 trial was conducted with 1 patient to show one experience with HUC in depth and thereby potentially reveal real-world benefits and challenges. RESULTS: Patients perceived HUC to be useful, easy to use, and enjoyable, preferred it to state-of-the-art approaches, and expressed their intentions to use it. Moreover, patients built a working alliance with the CA. Physiotherapists saw a relative advantage of HUC compared to current approaches but initially did not see the potential in terms of a working alliance, which changed after seeing the results of HUC in the field. Qualitative feedback from patients indicated that they enjoyed doing the exercise with an augmented reality-based CA and understood better how to do the exercise correctly with HUC. Moreover, physiotherapists highlighted that HUC would be helpful to use in the therapy process. The longitudinal field study resulted in an adherence rate of 92% (11/12 sessions; 330/360 repetitions; 33/36 sets) and a substantial increase in exercise accuracy during the 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The overall positive assessments from both patients and health care experts suggest that HUC is a promising tool to be applied in various disorders with a relevant set of home exercises. Future research, however, must implement a variety of exercises and test HUC with patients suffering from different disorders.

AB  - Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is a chronic centralized pain disorder characterized by widespread pain and fatigue. Of those affected by FMS, the majority are women, and minimal research exists involving men. The purpose of this paper is to describe the pain and fatigue experiences of men with FMS from two Western countries, Spain and the United States, in order to support more accurate and earlier recognition and diagnosis in men. We used individual and focus group interviews with qualitative and quantitative assessments. Ten men in Spain and seven men in the United States provided information about their symptoms, psychosocial and health-seeking behaviors, and gender experiences with FMS. Men articulated types, trends, and triggers of pain and fatigue that enrich an understanding of their symptoms. For example, men report more localized pain than generalized pain. Employment status and activities, among other contextual factors, impacted men's pain and fatigue experiences. Men experience distinct facets of pain and fatigue compared with women, with notable similarities and differences across the Spanish and U.S. samples. Cross-cultural comparisons highlight contextual factors that may inspire future inquiries about determinants of men's experiences with FMS. The present study could be useful for anyone treating men suffering from FMS, especially care providers in nursing, medical, and psychology fields. These initial findings may prompt a closer examination of recommendations for assessment and diagnostic criteria used internationally for patients with FMS with better recognition of men's experience. • Compared to women, men with FMS experience distinct facets of pain and fatigue. • Spanish and American men with FMS experience similar quantitative levels of pain. • Qualitative descriptors of pain differed between Spanish and American men with FMS. • Patterns and triggers of pain differed between Spanish and American men with FMS. • Spanish and American men with FMS report consistent experiences of fatigue.

AB  - Introduction: Members of the emergency medical assistance team have been recognized as a high-risk group for experiencing adverse health effects of stress caused by a number of intertwined factors. Excessive, prolonged and unrelenting stress can have serious health consequences and may lead to a burnout syndrome. The purpose of this research was to determine the physical, emotional and behavioral signs and symptoms of stress overload leading to a burnout syndrome. Methods: The study included 60 randomly selected males and females working in one of the four emergency medical assistance units in the Republic of Slovenia. An extensive non-standardized questionnaire consisting of 12 questions was used in the study as a data collection instrument. The data gathered were statistically analysed. Results: Results of the study show that the majority (73.4%) of members of the emergency medical assistance team experience chronic stress overload due to the nature and amount of work. The most stressful is the management of emotional reactions to traumatic situations (88.4%) and the lack of staff (86.6%). The most common burnout signs and symptoms are emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion manifested as fatigue, insomnia, frequent headaches, back and shoulder pain, muscle aches and angry feelings. Discussion and conclusion: Despite heavy stress at work, the duration and frequence of physical, emotional and behavioural signs and/or symptoms experienced by the study participants do not indicate the presence of a burnout syndrome. The participants do, however, report of experiencing some warning signs of impending burnout.

AB  - Multidisciplinary functional rehabilitation programs are considered to be the treatment of choice for patients with chronic low back pain. Elaboration of such programs is complex, however, and little description is found in the literature. This article details the elaboration of a rehabilitation program. A second article will analyze the implementation of the tools selected. After initial preparation (focus groups, literature review, selection of concepts), a period of team education and development of concepts was required. Once consensus was obtained, appropriate tools and techniques were chosen to integrate these concepts into the program. This process resulted in a clear, unified message, an essential foundation for the efficiency and perpetuity of the program. Level of evidence : not applicable

AB  - When treating patients suffering from chronic low back pain, it is important to determine therapeutic objectives that are realistic, measurable and focused on the activities of everyday life. To help patients and therapists to elaborate these objectives, we developped a clinical tool made of a metric scale graduated from 0 to 10 and of a series of photographs. Within the framework of a semi-structured interview, this tool is a help not only in the detection of relevant activities that may induce fear avoidance behaviours but also in the determination and negotiation of objectives that can be realised in the care process and are adapted to the patient's context of living.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify and analyze nurses' perceptions about diseases that are treated by acupuncture, taking into consideration: (1) the diseases of nurses who had received acupuncture treatment; (2) nurses' diseases which might be treated by acupuncture; (3) suggestions of diseases treatable by acupuncture. This exploratory study was performed with 33 nurses working at 11 health units in southeast São Paulo; places in which acupuncture treatment was available. Results showed that acupuncture was mostly used for stress (10.7%), anxiety, migraines, lumbar pain, myoma and obesity (7.1% each). Acupuncture was suggested as treatments mostly for musculoskeletal diseases (42%), and chronic-degenerative diseases (10%).

AB  - Study Design: This was a cross-sectional observational study in which the abdominal aorta was evaluated for atheromatous lesions visible in computed tomographic scans in patients with and without low back pain.Objectives: To evaluate whether patients with low back pain have more atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta than patients without low back pain and whether the severity of atherosclerosis in the abdominal aorta correlates with the grade of disc damage.Summary Of Background Data: There are studies in which results indicate that insufficient blood supply may be a significant causative factor in disc degeneration. There are also studies in which smoking, one of the risk factors for arterial disease, has been correlated with low back pain. Calf pain has also been shown to correlate with low back pain. Results in a long-term follow-up study have further indicated an association between disc diseases and fatal ischemic heart disease. However, there seems to be only one postmortem study in which results show an association between atherosclerosis in the arteries of the lumbar area and disc diseases.Methods: Computed tomographic images of 29 patients with low back pain, who had been evaluated with computed tomographic discography for diagnostic purposes, were evaluated for the quantity of atherosclerotic calcifications visible on computed tomographic scans of the abdominal aorta. A similar evaluation was performed in an age- and sex-matched control group of 52 patients without low back pain selected from among the patients referred for abdominal computed tomography.Results: Sixteen (55%) of the 29 patients with low back pain had atherosclerotic calcifications visible on computed tomographic scans, whereas 11 (21%) of the 52 age-matched patients without low back pain were found to have aortic calcifications. Eleven (48%) patients with low back pain who were 50 years of age or less (n = 23) had aortic calcifications, whereas only 3 (8%) of the 36 control patients aged less than 50 years had aortic calcifications. There was no correlation between the amount of calcifications and the degree of disc degeneration assessed by computed tomographic discography.Conclusions: A significant association is indicated between atheromatous lesions in the abdominal aorta and low back pain.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate an in situ stress reduction program, named PROGRESS, developed to meet the specific needs of workers in a business context and to research its impact upon non-severe psychiatric symptoms, stress, anxiety, depression, processing speed/attention and mindfulness. Methods: Participants with stress complaints were randomized into two groups: the main intervention group: group 1-G1, (n = 22); and the control group: group 2-G2, (n = 22). The protocol was divided into three distinct phases for the purpose of the study. Both groups were evaluated at time 1 (T1), before the first 8-week intervention, which only G1 received. The second evaluation was made on both groups at time 2 (T2), immediately after this first program; in order to test the program\u0027s replicability and investigate possible follow-up effects, an identical second 8-week program was offered to G2 during time 3 (T3), while G1 was simply instructed to maintain the practice they had learned without further instruction between T2 and T3. A Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to investigate the construct validity of PROGRESS. Results: Repeated measures MANOVA test, comparing G1 and G2, showed the effect of the intervention from T1 to T2 (p = 0.021) and from T2 to T3 (p = 0.031). Univariate analysis showed that participants from G1 improved levels of non-severe psychiatric symptoms, anxiety, depression, stress, processing speed/attention and mindfulness when compared with G2, from T1 to T2 (p \u003c 0.05). After the participants in G2 received the intervention (T2 to T3), this group also showed improvement in the same variables (p \u003c 0.05). At the end of their follow-up period (T2-T3) - during which they received no further support or instruction - G1 maintained the improvements gained during T1-T2. The two main components were stress (stress in the last 24-h, in the last week and last month) and mental health (non-severe psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety and mindfulness). Conclusion: PROGRESS, an in situ mindfulness program adapted to fit within the reality of business time constraints, was effective at replicating in more than one group the reduction of stress, depression, anxiety, non-severe psychiatric symptoms, processing speed and also the improvement of attention skills, showing sustained improvement even after 8-weeks follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical effectiveness of active management (AM) in general practice versus AM plus a group-based, professionally led cognitive behavioural approach (CBA) for subacute and chronic low back pain (LBP) and to measure the cost of each strategy over a period of 12 months and estimate cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: Pragmatic multicentred randomised controlled trial with investigator-blinded assessment of outcomes. SETTING: Fifty-six general practices from seven English regions. PARTICIPANTS: People with subacute and chronic LBP who were experiencing symptoms that were at least moderately troublesome. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised (in a ratio of 2:1) to receive either AM+CBA or AM alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ) and the Modified Von Korff Scale (MVK), which measure LBP and disability. Secondary outcomes included mental and physical health-related quality of life (Short Form 12-item health survey), health status, fear avoidance beliefs and pain self-efficacy. Cost-utility of CBA was considered from both the UK NHS perspective and a broader health-care perspective, including both NHS costs and costs of privately purchased goods and services related to LBP. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated from the five-item EuroQoL. RESULTS: Between April 2005 and April 2007, 701 participants were randomised: 233 to AM and 468 to AM+CBA. Of these, 420 were female. The mean age of participants was 54 years and mean baseline RMQ was 8.7. Outcome data were obtained for 85% of participants at 12 months. Benefits were seen across a range of outcome measures in favour of CBA with no evidence of group or therapist effects. CBA resulted in at least twice as much improvement as AM. Mean additional improvement in the CBA arm was 1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 1.7], 1.4 (95% CI 0.7 to 2.1) and 1.3 (95% CI 0.6 to 2.1) change points in the RMQ at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. Additional improvement in MVK pain was 6.8 (95% CI 3.5 to 10.2), 8.0 (95% CI 4.3 to 11.7) and 7.0 (95% CI 3.2 to 10.7) points, and in MVK disability was 4.3 (95% CI 0.4 to 8.2), 8.1 (95% CI 4.1 to 12.0) and 8.4 (95% CI 4.4 to 12.4) points at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. At 12 months, 60% of the AM+CBA arm and 31% of the AM arm reported some or complete recovery. Mean cost of attending a CBA course was 187 pounds per participant with an additional benefit in QALYs of 0.099 and an additional cost of 178.06 pounds. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 1786.00 pounds. Probability of CBA being cost-effective reached 90% at about 3000 pounds and remained at that level or above; at a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pounds the CBA group had an almost 100% probability of being considered cost-effective. User perspectives on the acceptability of group treatments were sought through semi-structured interviews. Most were familiar with key messages of AM; most who had attended any group sessions had retained key messages from the sessions and two-thirds talked about a reduction in fear avoidance and changes in their behaviour. Group sessions appeared to provide reassurance, lessen isolation and enable participants to learn strategies from each other. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CBA in treating subacute and chronic LBP was shown, making this intervention attractive to patients, clinicians and purchasers. Short-term (3-month) clinical effects were similar to those found in high-quality studies of other therapies and benefits were maintained and increased over the long term (12 months). Cost per QALY was about half that of competing interventions for LBP and because the intervention can be delivered by existing NHS staff following brief training, the back skills training programme could be implemented within the NHS with relative ease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past decade, a considerable amount of research has been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of innovative low back pain (LBP) interventions. Although some interventions proved to be effective, they are not always applied in daily practice. To successfully implement an innovative program it is important to identify barriers and facilitators in order to change practice routine. Because usual care is not directly aimed at return to work (RTW), we evaluated an integrated care program, combining a patient-directed and a workplace-directed intervention provided by a multidisciplinary team, including a clinical occupational physician to reduce occupational disability in chronic LBP patients. The aims of this study were to describe the feasibility of the implementation of the integrated care program, to assess the satisfaction and expectations of the involved stakeholders and to describe the needs for improvement of the program. METHODS: Eligible for this study were patients who had been on sick leave due to chronic LBP. Data were collected from the patients, their supervisors and the involved health care professionals, by means of questionnaires and structured charts, during 3-month follow-up. Implementation, satisfaction and expectations were investigated. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients who were eligible to participate in the integrated care program, 37 patients, their supervisors and the health care professionals actually participated in the intervention. Adherence to the integrated care program was in accordance with the protocol, and the patients, their supervisors and the health care professionals were (very) satisfied with the program. The role of the clinical occupational physician was of additional value in the RTW process. Time-investment was the only barrier for implementation reported by the multidisciplinary team. CONCLUSION: The implementation of this program will not be influenced by any flaws in its application that are related to the program itself, or to the adherence of patients with chronic LBP and their health care professionals. This program is promising in terms of feasibility, satisfaction and compliance of the patients, their supervisors and the health care professionals. Before implementation on a wider scale, the communication and the information technology of the program should be improved.

AB  - The impact of stressful life events on the development and onset of chronicity of low-back pain is not yet fully understood. Sixty-four consecutive patients with chronic low-back pain treated at the orthopedic out-patient unit of the Innsbruck University Hospital were investigated with regard to stressful life events. Patients were classified into two groups: one group consisting of patients whose pain had an organic etiology (n= 16), and another group consisting of those with pain of uncertain origin (idiopathic group, n=48). A method combining a semistructured interview with a self-assessment of the severity of stress caused by life events was employed for assessing the impact of such events on chronic low-back pain. In comparison to the patient group having organic causes of pain, the idiopathic group showed significantly more patients having at least one highly stressful event preceding the last substantial aggravation of pain (p=0.028). The latter group experienced significantly more exhaustion (p=0.016) and significantly more difficulties in active coping (p=0.011) when confronted with stressful life events. Stressful life events that arouse feelings of helplessness may contribute to the development of chronic idiopathic low-back pain. Our results emphasize the importance of investigating the subjective meaning and appraisal of stressful life events, taking into consideration both individual predisposition and psychosocial resources available to the patient. Finally, it is also important that the attending physician be aware of any life event that is particularly stressful for the patient so that psychosocial help be made available at the appropriate time.

AB  - While hope has been described as the ability to imagine a future in which one wishes to participate, individuals with chronic pain can have difficulty maintaining hope due to the pervasive impact of pain on multiple facets of their lives. This research examines client experiences of hope during a hope and strengths activity offered as part of a group treatment plan for individuals experiencing chronic pain. EntitledBeing Hopeful in the Face of Chronic Pain, the group was developed in order to focus on hope and generative emotional experiences, experiences often lacking for individuals with chronic pain. The group activity being studied specifically addressed participants’ current strengths and strengths they hope-to-have-more-of. The study employed basic qualitative inquiry and utilized interpersonal process recall individual interviews to stimulate participant recall. Twelve participants (spanning three separate group offerings) individually discussed their personal experiences as they unfolded during a specific hope and strengths-focused activity. Participants described experiences during the group activity that fostered personal hope via perspective shifts, communion, comparison and connection with other group members. Findings are discussed in the context of current literature on hope, chronic pain, positive psychology and group interventions.

AB  - Many older people live with a range of chronic diseases. However, these diseases do not necessarily impede an active lifestyle. In this article the author analyses the relation between the active ageing discourse and the way older people at two Danish activity centres handle disease. How does active ageing change everyday life with chronic disease, and how do older people combine an active life with a range of chronic diseases? The participants in the study use activities to keep their diseases at arm's length, and this distancing of disease at the same time enables them to engage in social and physical activities at the activity centre. In this way, keeping disease at arm's length is analysed as an ambiguous health strategy. The article shows the importance of looking into how active ageing is practised, as active ageing seems to work well in the everyday life of the older people by not giving emphasis to disease. The article is based on ethnographic fieldwork and uses vignettes of four participants to show how they each keep diseases at arm's length.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week implementation intention intervention for promoting physical activity among individuals with spinal cord injury. Study Design: Randomized clinical trial. Method: Participants were randomly assigned to an implementation intention intervention (n = 26) or control (n = 28) condition and were asked to engage in 30 min of moderate to heavy intensity physical activity 3 times per week. Results: Participants who formed implementation intentions followed through with their physical activity intentions, engaging in more physical activity than participants in the control condition. Participants in the intervention condition also experienced sustained motivation and greater confidence to schedule physical activity compared with participants in the control condition. Implications: These findings suggest a role for implementation intentions in health promotion programs for people with spinal cord injury.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In conditions such as phantom limb pain and low back pain body image is distorted. This qualitative study investigates body image in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain (CNP), its influence on their everyday life and any changes linked to traditional cupping therapy. METHODS: The study was conducted with a convenience sample of 6 patients with CNP from a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) on cupping. The data came from body image drawings and semi-structured interviews. The latter were analysed using Mayring's content analysis techniques. RESULTS: The patients' drawings showed apparent body image distortions with elements that were missing or deformed. The interviews showed that pain was the predominant perception, influencing patients' body perception. Patients saw their pain as beyond their control, using mostly passive strategies to cope. After cupping, patients reported less pain and improved pain perception. These changes were reflected in their drawings. CONCLUSION: Patients with CNP experienced apparent body image distortions, which traditional cupping therapy appeared to improve. Additional research is needed to further explore this link.

AB  - Background  Hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) affect a large and growing proportion of the population. Treatment options are typically conservative making self-management a priority. Using trained peers to support individuals with OA has potential to improve self-management.  Purpose  To explore the process of engaging and training volunteers to become peer mentors; and to qualitatively evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and value of being a peer mentor to support others\u0027 self-management of OA.  Materials and methods  A qualitative evaluation of a peer mentorship support intervention reporting the processes of recruitment and training; and semi-structured interviews conducted with nine active peer mentors. Transcribed interviews were coded and analysed using framework analysis.  Results  It was possible to recruit, train and retain volunteers with OA to become peer mentors. The peer mentors benefitted from their training and felt equipped to deliver the intervention. They enjoyed social elements of the mentorship intervention and gained satisfaction through delivering valued support to mentees. Peer mentors perceived the mentorship intervention to have a positive impact on self-management of OA for mentees.  Conclusion  Training volunteers with OA to become peer mentors was feasible and acceptable. Peer mentors perceived their support benefitted others with OA. They positively rated their experience of providing mentorship support.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThis study demonstrates that it is possible to recruit, train and engage older volunteers to become peer mentors for people with osteoarthritis.Training should highlight the significance of employing key self-management techniques such as goal-setting.Peer mentors acknowledged that they benefitted from training and delivering the mentorship intervention, and this impacted positively on their own osteoarthritis self-management.Careful consideration of matching mentors and mentees appears to enhance the success of mentorship support.Recognising the impact of mentorship support on mentees\u0027 self-management is central to peer mentors\u0027 sustained engagement with the intervention.

AB  - The undertreatment of pain is a major health issue in the United States, with children, elderly, and minorities at risk. An in-depth interview survey was conducted of 1,000 persons living at home with pain due to a medical condition to assess their attitudes toward pain, medications, and their doctors, as well as to identify the size and scope of undertreatment. Sixty-one percent have experienced pain for at least five years. For 40% of these patients the pain is constant; for 60%, intermittent; for 49%, moderate; for 22%, severe. Ninety percent have seen a physician; 67% are presently under a doctor's care; 86% see the same clinician for the pain and its cause; 50% see a general practitioner or family physician (GP/FP); only 13% have seen a pain specialist. Twenty-one percent have been scored on a pain scale; in half (49%) of those who were scored, a numeric scale was used; a verbal scale was used in 22%. Forty-two percent say their prescription analgesic is less than very effective; 67% indicated that their daily lives have been altered by pain; 51% say they cannot remember what it feels like not to be in pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of social support on the long-term condition after a spinal cord injury (SCI) varies across studies mainly involving self-report questionnaires. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the common factors associated with social support leading individuals with an SCI to the effective prevention of secondary complications, including via adherence to medical follow-up. METHODS: Inclusion criteria were a history of acquired SCI of any etiology, wheelchair use, and age>=18 years at the time of the study. Participants should have completed their initial rehabilitation program in France>=1 year earlier and were also enrolled according to 2 related study variables: routine medical follow-up (patients were or were not followed up) and the medically supervised reporting of a pressure ulcer after the initial rehabilitation session (0 or>=1 pressure ulcers). We performed a preparatory quantitative and qualitative literature review to identify factors affecting long-term follow-up after SCI, then adopted a narrative design with semi-structured interviews, transcribed and analyzed progressively by using qualitative analysis software. RESULTS: We included 32 participants. We categorized our results based on the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices of participants with respect to pressure ulcer prevention and long-term medical follow-up. Our narrative approach allowed us to identify 3 main domains relevant to social support: reciprocity, self-management and timing related to social support. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed social support as a dynamic process, a reciprocal phenomenon evolving in variations over time. These findings should be central to short- and long-term therapeutic education programs for patients and for people providing social support. Effective changes should also be implemented through the concept of the Learning Health System.

AB  - Background: Practice guidelines recommend various types of exercise for chronic back pain but there have been few head-to-head comparisons of these interventions. General exercise seems to be an effective option for management of chronic low back pain (LBP) but very little is known about the management of a sub-acute LBP within sub-groups. Recent research has developed clinical tests to identify a subgroup of patients with chronic non-specific LBP who have movement control dysfunction (MD).Method/design: We are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the effects of general exercise and specific movement control exercise (SMCE) on disability and function in patients with MD within recurrent sub-acute LBP. The main outcome measure is the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire.Discussion: European clinical guideline for management of chronic LBP recommends that more research is required to develop tools to improve the classification and identification of specific clinical sub-groups of chronic LBP patients. Good quality RCTs are then needed to determine the effectiveness of specific interventions aimed at these specific target groups. This RCT aims to test the hypothesis whether patients within a sub-group of MD benefit more through a specific individually tailored movement control exercise program than through general exercises.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This 1-year prospective study aimed at assessing the association between some psychosocial job characteristics and back-related functional limitations. METHODS: The participants were 849 workers who sought medical consultation for nonspecific back pain in primary care settings of the Quebec City area. Information on job decision latitude, psychological demands, and social support at work was collected during a telephone interview conducted after the medical consultation. Back-related functional limitations were measured at baseline and 1 year later with the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. The analyses were stratified by gender. Social support at work and the type of back pain were considered potential effect modifiers. Several potential confounders were also considered in the multiple regression analyses that were conducted to isolate the effect of the job psychological demands and decision latitude on the 1-year level of back-related functional limitations. RESULTS: A modest difference in the 1-year Roland-Morris average scores was found only among the women and only for the association between job decision latitude with back-related functional limitations, according to the level of social support at work. This difference was of limited clinical significance. Analyses by type of back pain showed, however, a clinically significant association between the combination of high psychological demands and low decision latitude and back-related functional limitations only for subjects with persistent pain. CONCLUSIONS: Job psychological demands and decision latitude have little influence on the 1-year evolution of back-related functional limitations for one-time and recurrent back-pain problems. However, our results suggest that this association could be important for workers with persistent pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the acceptance of non-pharmacological group strategies delivered to low income racially diverse patients with chronic pain and depression. This paper examines how the Integrative Medical Group Visit (IMGV) addresses many of the deficits identified with usual care. DESIGN AND SETTING: Six IMGVs cohorts were held at a safety net hospital and two federally funded community health centres. Data was gathered through focus groups. Transcripts were analysed using both a priori codes and inductive coding. INTERVENTION: The intervention included ten sessions of Integrative Medical Group Visits with a primary care provider and a meditation instructor. The curriculum uses principles of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction and evidence based integrative medicine. The visit is structured similarly to other group medical visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data was gathered through four focus groups held after the cohorts were completed. RESULTS: Participants (N=20) were largely low income minority adults with chronic pain and comorbid depression. Six themes emerged from the coding including: chronic pain is isolating; group treatment contributes to better coping with pain; loss of control and autonomy because of the unpredictability of pain as well as dependence on medication and frequent medical appointments; groups improve agency and control over one's health condition; navigating the healthcare system and unsatisfactory treatment options; and changes after the IMGV due to non-pharmacological health management. CONCLUSIONS: The IMGV is a promising format of delivering integrative care for chronic pain and depression which addresses many of the problems identified by patients in usual care.

AB  - Background: Low back pain is a highly prevalent chronic condition, yet little is known about the disabling effects of this common problem in older adults. This study examines the relationship between the presence and severity of low back pain and disability in older women.Methods: The study population was 1,002 disabled older women participating in a population-based prospective study of disablement. Key outcome measures of disability included level of difficulty and inability to perform the following daily activities: light housework, shopping, walking one-quarter mile, climbing stairs, lifting, and activities of daily living (ADLs).Results: Forty-two percent of participants reported they had low back pain for at least one month in the year before baseline. The prevalence of severe back pain decreased markedly with age (10% of those > or = 85 yr versus 23% in each of the two younger 10 yr age groups). After multivariate adjustments, women with severe back pain were 3 to 4 times more likely than other women to have a lot of difficulty with light housework or shopping. There was also an increased likelihood of difficulty with mobility tasks and basic ADLs among those with severe back pain. No associations were found between back pain and being unable to perform any of the daily activities studied, indicating possible differences in disablement processes leading to functional difficulties versus functional incapacity.Conclusions: There was a strong association between back pain and functional difficulties in older women, pointing to the need for further research using longitudinal methods.

AB  - Purpose: Multivariate analysis of T2-weighted signal, diffusion ADC, and DKI parameters and tractography were used to differentiate chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP) patients and asymptomatic controls (AC).Methods: A total of 30 patients with CLBP and 23 AC underwent diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) of lumbar spine with a 3T MRI scanner to get the ADC values and seven parameters of DKI in the nucleus pulposus (NP) of the intervertebral disc. The tractography and the tract-related parameters as other parameters were also generated to indicate the intactness of annulus fibrosus (AF). T2-grades of the discs were also quantified based on an eight-grade degeneration grading system. ADC and T2-grades were compared with DKI parameters for the differentiation of CLBP and AC groups.Results: There was no difference in the T2 grades, ADC value, and multiple parameters in DKI of NP between CLBP and AC groups (P > 0.05). The average FA values in NP in AC group were found significantly higher than in the CLBP group (P < 0.05). The scores for the intactness of AF of the intervertebral discs were significantly different in CLBP and AC groups, with 90% of sensitivity and 70% specificity (P < 0.05). Additionally, there were significantly differences in the length and volume values of the AF in CLBP and AC groups (P < 0.05).Conclusion: DKI is a good noninvasive method, and it might help to differentiate CLBP from AC. Particularly, the continuation of DKI tractography reflects the presence of annulus fibrosus fissures, an important character in the generation of the low back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acupuncture injection therapy for the patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP) systematically. METHODS: Four English online databases and 4 Chinese online databases will be researched systematically from their inception to December 31, 2018. Reference management software, Endnote X7, will be used to manage and screen the records. After removing the duplicate records, 2 independent reviewers will select the studies that meet the inclusion criteria. "Risk of table" recommend by Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions will be used to judge the quality of the included records. All data will be extracted by 1 reviewer and checked by another reviewer. Any disagree will be addressed via consulting a third reviewer in the above processes. Microsoft Excel will be used to manage and convert data if necessary. The missing data will be obtained via emailing the original authors of included studies. Review Manager (RevMan5.3) will be used to perform the data synthesis if enough data were collected. Otherwise, only the qualitative analysis will be performed. Based on the heterogeneity results, fixed-effect model or random-effect model will be used to estimate the overall effect of acupuncture injection therapy for patients with nonspecific CLBP. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis will be also performed to explore the sources of heterogeneity. If there are enough records included, the publish bias will be assessed by funnel plot. All procedures will be strictly performed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. CONCLUSION: This review will offer clinical evidence of acupuncture injection therapy for the patients with nonspecific CLBP. Prospero research registration identifying number: Crd42019119158.

AB  - Purpose: This article presents an overview of the issues relating to patient compliance in the prescription of exercise programs. Method: A qualitative review of the literature was performed. Summary: Compliance with home-based exercise programs can be improved when a cognitive-behavioral approach is taken. Biopsychosocial approaches that emphasize the absence of serious disease, lifestyle as the key to long-term results, and return to function despite benign pain can improve overall compliance and outcome. Educational content can be specifically tailored to acute, subacute, and chronic stage patients in reports of findings. Compliance, motivation, and adherence are crucial issues in active treatment.

AB  - Percutaneous disc decompression using the Decompressor system is another treatment option for patients suffering from chronic discogenic leg pain. This is the first report on a patient undergoing this procedure under CT-control. A 49 year old man with radicular leg pain showed significant pain reduction after percutaneus decompression of a discal herniation at the L4/5 level. The new system enables qualitative and quantitative measures of the removed disc material. CT-control ensures exact positioning of the device.

AB  - Background: Musculoskeletal pain is among the most common reasons for seeking care, specialist competence for its treatment in primary care limited and waiting lists for orthopaedics often amongst the longest. Many referrals to orthopaedics do not concern disorders that benefit from surgery. Manual therapy is effective, yet not integrated in national health care systems, and there is a lack of research on other than neck and low back pain, and a lack of long-term follow-ups. The present study evaluates the long-term effects of a manual therapy (naprapathy) for common orthopaedic disorders. Methods: An 8-year follow-up (96 months) of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of naprapathy (experimental group) versus standard orthopaedic care (control group) for non-surgical patients of working age with the most common musculoskeletal disorders on the waiting lists (n = 78). Bodily pain, physical function (SF36), Quality of life (QoL; SF6D), and data on health care utilization were collected. The treatments lasted from January 2007 to November 2007. Results: N = 75 participants in the original study sample completed the 8-year follow-up. The differences in bodily pain (21.7 (95% CI: 9.1–34.3)), physical function (17.6 (6.7–28.4)), and QoLs (0.823 (95% CI: 0.785–0.862) compared with 0.713 (95% CI: 0.668–0.758)) were statistically significantly in favor of the experimental group (p-values < 0.01). After sensitivity analysis the experimental group had altogether 260 health care visits compared with 1161 in the control group. Conclusions: Naprapathy is a continuously effective treatment. Together with earlier research our study suggests that specialized manual therapy should be considered when triaging patients with common non-surgical musculoskeletal disorders in national health care systems. Trial registration: Not applicable, as per information given by ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aboriginal people in Australia have been uniquely identified as less susceptible to chronic low back pain (CLBP) disability when compared to non-Aboriginal populations, reportedly due to cultural beliefs about pain. A qualitative, culturally secure research approach was used to explore this assumption. METHODS: In-depth interviews were undertaken with 32 Aboriginal men and women with CLBP in regional and remote areas of Western Australia. Interviews were conducted collaboratively with male and female Aboriginal co-investigators, and with the support of local Aboriginal community organizations. A primary focus was to investigate the impact of CLBP from the perspective of Aboriginal people living with the condition. RESULTS: The experience of CLBP was found to be multidimensional, impacting on activities of daily life, employment, sport and family participation, emotional and cultural well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous assumptions, CLBP is profoundly disabling for some Aboriginal people and a priority health concern. Issues of gender, cultural obligations and the emotional consequences of CLBP are important consideration for health care. These findings, and the contextual approach used to gain an in-depth understanding of CLBP, may be relevant to populations elsewhere.

AB  - One of the most commonly used experimental animal models for neuropathic pain is the chronic constriction injury (CCI) where four loose ligatures are tied around the sciatic nerve. One disadvantage of this model is the introduction of foreign material into the wound, which causes a local inflammatory reaction. Thus the distinction between the neuropathic and the inflammatory component of pain is difficult in this model. In order to produce a pure nerve lesion, we performed a partial sciatic nerve transection (PST; a modification of the Seltzer model) in female Sprague-Dawley rats and compared behavior and nerve pathology. These rats developed thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia comparable to the CCI model. Recovery of these symptoms was found between days 40 and 60 after the nerve lesion. Some animals still showed symptoms on day 101, which was associated with a neuroma formation. The main pathological findings in the endoneurium in nerve segments distal to the lesion were edema, loss of myelinated fibers and increase in endoneurial cells, especially macrophages. In the epineurium the number of macrophages was strikingly increased after CCI compared with PST, indicating that the response of the immune system is different in a structural lesion with and without foreign material. In conclusion, PST is a pure nerve injury model without an epineurial inflammatory component due to foreign material and is therefore well suited for studying the role of local endoneurial processes in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. Also, the importance of regeneration in the termination of hyperalgesia can convincingly be shown in this model.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore and obtain increased knowledge about (i) strategies and treatments used by individuals with neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury (SCI) for handling long-term pain, and (ii) their experience, needs and expectations of SCI neuropathic pain management. METHODS: Qualitative methods with an emergent research design were used. Eighteen informants who suffered from long-term SCI neuropathic pain participated. Data were collected with diaries and thematized research interviews. Content analysis and constant comparison according to grounded theory were used for the analyses. RESULTS: A model with four categories emerged: "Pain is my main problem" explained the impact of pain in the informants' everyday life; "Drugs--the health care solution" described the informants' experience of pain management; "The gap in my meeting with health care" described the discrepancy between what the informants wanted and what health care could offer. "But...this works for me" described treatments and strategies, which the informants found helpful for pain control and pain relief. CONCLUSION: Neuropathic pain, one of the major problems following SCI, is difficult to treat successfully. To improve treatment outcome, health care needs to listen to, respond to and respect the patient's knowledge, experience and wishes. Future research needs to address treatments that patients find effective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Workers with persistent disabling low back pain (LBP) often encounter difficulty staying at work. Self-management (SM) programs can offer interesting avenues to help workers stay at work. OBJECTIVE: To establish the plausibility of a logic model operationalizing a SM program designed to help workers with persistent disabling LBP stay at work. METHODS: We used a qualitative design. A preliminary version of the logic model was developed based on the literature and McLaughlin et al.'s framework for logic models. Clinicians in work rehabilitation completed an online survey on the plausibility of the logic model and proposed modifications, which were discussed in a focus group. Thematic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Participants (n = 11) found the model plausible, contingent upon a few modifications. They raised the importance of making more explicit the margin of maneuver or "job leeway" for a worker who is trying to stay at work and suggested emphasizing a capability approach. Enhancing the workers' perceived self-efficacy and communication skills were deemed essential tasks of the model. CONCLUSION: A plausible logic model for a SM program designed for workers with disabling LBP stay at work was developed. The next step will be to assess its acceptability with potential users.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To gain a better understanding of fear‐avoidance beliefs towards physical activity and body awareness in people experiencing moderate‐to‐severe rheumatic pain. Background: Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are long‐term conditions with pain as the prominent symptom. Health‐promoting physical activity is recommended and can have an analgesic effect. High self‐rated pain has previously been reported to be associated with increased fear‐avoidance behaviour in relation to physical activity. Body awareness, which includes attentional focus and awareness of internal body sensations, could be valuable in the nursing care of long‐term diseases. Design: Empirical phenomenological. Methods: An empirical phenomenological psychological method was applied. The interviews took place between autumn 2016–spring 2017 with 11 informants (eight women and three men, age range 44–71 years) who were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 7) or psoriatic arthritis (n = 4), with a disease duration ranging from 3–35 years. The mean visual analogue scale score in the study sample was 60 mm. Results: Three typologies were identified: "My relatively fragile physical status", "I am an active creator" and "Part of something bigger than myself." Conclusions: The current findings indicated that pain anticipation and fear‐avoidance beliefs towards physical activity sometimes affected the behaviour of individuals with long‐term rheumatic pain syndromes. People experiencing moderate‐to‐severe rheumatic pain tended to focus on their fragile physical and emotional state. By adopting a more favourable attitude towards the self, the body could be restored to a state of calm and balance. Relevance to clinical practice: The current findings are relevant for healthcare professionals engaged in health‐promotion clinical practice.

AB  - PURPOSE: The present study aims at investigating the effects of low back pain (LBP), i.e., type of symptoms, activity limitations, frequency, duration, and severity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a sample of 707 community-dwelling men and women aged >= 65 years living in Switzerland. METHODS: The study is part of a larger survey conducted in Switzerland on a sample of older adults selected randomly from population records, stratified by age and sex. The Standardized Back Pain Definition was used to investigate LBP, and HRQoL was assessed by means of the EQ-5D, including Health Utility Index (HUI) measures. RESULTS: For more than half of the sufferers, pain was chronic, occurred most days or every day and induced activity limitations. One-third of the sufferers reported sciatica symptoms. Individuals reporting every day pain, severe pain and more than 3 years since the last episode without pain lost nearly 10 points of HRQoL. Amongst the dimension of HRQoL, Mobility was the most affected by LBP. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further insight into the impact of qualitative aspects of LBP and in particular the importance of radiating leg pain and pain frequency and duration. While LBP-related activity limitations had little impact on both self-rated overall health and HUI, radiating leg pain and pain frequency and duration were associated with significantly decreased scores on both dimensions.

AB  - Aims\r\n\r\nThe aim of this study was to describe chronic pain self-management from the perspective of individuals living with chronic pain in the context of primary care nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nSelf-management is a key chronic pain treatment modality and support for self-managing chronic pain is mainly provided in the context of primary care. Although nurses are optimally suited to facilitate self-management in primary care, there is a need to explore opportunities for optimizing their roles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n\r\nTwo cross-sectional studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nThe Chronic Pain Self-Management Survey was conducted in 2011–2012 to explore the epidemiology and self-management of chronic pain in Canadian adults. The questionnaire was distributed to 1504 individuals in Ontario. In 2011, the Primary Care Nursing Roles Survey was distributed to 1911 primary care nurses in Ontario to explore their roles and to determine the extent to which chronic disease management strategies, including support for self-management, were implemented in primary care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nFew respondents to the pain survey identified nurses as being the ‘most helpful’ facilitator of self-management while physicians were most commonly cited. Seventy-six per cent of respondents used medication to manage their chronic pain. Few respondents to the nursing survey worked in practices with specific programmes for individuals with chronic pain. Individuals with chronic pain identified barriers and facilitators to self-managing their pain and nurses identified barriers and facilitators to optimizing their role in primary care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThere are several opportunities for primary care practices to facilitate self-management of chronic pain, including the optimization of the primary care nursing role.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The effectiveness of treatments for chronic, degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine can be influenced by patient perceptions and expectations regarding treatment. PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this study was to understand the factors that are important to individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) regarding different nonsurgical treatments. These factors were considered within the context of each treatment received as a part of the parent randomized controlled trial (RCT). STUDY DESIGN: Focus group study of RCT participants. PATIENT SAMPLE: Convenience sample of 50 individuals with LSS (28 female, average age 73+/-7.7 years) from an RCT participated in one of six focus groups. Focus groups consisted of patients previously randomized to one of three nonsurgical treatments: (1) medical care; (2) community-based group exercise; and (3) clinic-based manual therapy and individualized exercise. OUTCOME MEASURES: Experiences, opinions, and preferences of individuals with LSS who participated in an RCT. Inter-coder agreement for qualitative analysis was conducted with kappa statistics. METHODS: Participants discussed their experiences and perceptions regarding study treatment and their general experience with LSS using open-ended questions provided by a facilitator. Transcripts were coded according to modified grounded theory in an open approach, using codes that addressed the primary focus group discussion topics (primary coding) and codes for emerging topics (secondary coding). Secondary coding sought to identify themes concerning living with LSS and seeking treatment that were emergent from the focus groups. This study was funded by the Patient-Centered Research Outcomes Institute. The authors report no conflicts of interest. RESULTS: Three themes related to medical treatment and symptom management arose from analyses: (1) an emotional response to LSS; (2) a desire for education about LSS and motivation to pursue education from any available source; and (3) a desire for individualized care based on self-management techniques and lifestyle changes. Emotional responses were more evident in individuals receiving medical care, whereas the other two themes were consistent across all three treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The chronic pain associated with LSS may result in negative emotional responses. Individuals with LSS may believe misinformation and information from nonmedical sources, especially when medical providers do not spend sufficient time explaining the disease process and the reasoning behind treatment strategies. Receiving individualized care focused on self-management led to fewer negative emotions toward care and the disease process. Clinicians should be prepared to address all three of these aspects when providing care to individuals with LSS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlates of a recent history of disabling low back pain (LBP) in older persons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Pain in the Elderly (PAINEL) Study was derived from the Frailty among Brazilian Older Adults (FIBRA) Network Study. Data were collected through face-to-face/telephone interviews and clinical examination. A series of logistic regressions assessed associations between a recent history of disabling LBP and sociodemographic, physical/lifestyle, and psychological factors. RESULTS: Of the 378 community-dwelling elders included in the study (age+/-SD, 75.5+/-6.1), 9.3% experienced LBP that was bad enough to limit or change their daily activities during the past year. Those reporting a recent history of disabling LBP were more likely to be women and under financial strain, to present poor self-rated health, overweight, multimorbidity, low physical activity level, fatigue, depressive symptomatology/diagnosis and fear beliefs, and to report decreased sleep time, prolonged sitting time, chronic pain (in location other than lower back), and frequently recurring LBP. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that overweight (odds ratio [OR], 29.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-391.0), low physical activity level (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.3-15.4), fatigue (OR, 10.3; 95% CI, 2.4-43.4), depression diagnosis (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.3-18.4), and frequently recurring LBP (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.0-20.1) were independently associated with a recent history of disabling LBP. DISCUSSION: Our study supports the link between disabling LBP and other age-related chronic conditions in a middle-income country with a rapidly aging population.

AB  - Although subject to considerable research from perspectives including general practitioners, patients, and perspective guidelines, chronic low back pain (CLBP) continues to be a common but contentious condition in primary care. We used medical consultation records, critical incident interviews, and a think-aloud problem-solving task to examine how general practitioners applied professional knowledge of the condition, especially in relation to psychosocial care. Using qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis, we identified a pragmatic, goal-focused approach to patients, a schema based on biomedical knowledge and tacit theories of motivation. The doctors' expectations for CLBP included uncertainty over symptoms and doubts over patient credibility, which helped to explain an autonomous rather than collaborative approach to managing back pain patients. The findings are discussed in light of social representations theory, self-determination, and research on the therapeutic relationship.

AB  - Objectives: To pilot procedures to be used in a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture for low back pain.Design: Uncontrolled clinical trial.Setting: Primary care and acupuncture clinics in York, England.Subjects: 20 patients with low back pain lasting 1 month or more.Interventions: 10 sessions of individualized acupuncture from a traditional acupuncturist.Main Outcome Measures: Change in Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire; present pain intensity scale; effect on daily living scale, and SF-36 general health questionnaire at post-treatment and 6 months after the end of treatment.Results: 14 patients completed follow-up. Patients had similar severity scores at baseline to those referred to an NHS outpatient clinic. Post-treatment, there were statistically significant improvements in Oswestry, present pain intensity, effect on daily living and the physical functioning, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality and mental health sub-scales of the SF36. Similar results were found at the six month follow-up. Oswestry scores showed reduced levels of pain at 6 months compared to than at post-treatment, falling approximately 40% from baseline.Conclusions: Though the improvements in pain and quality in life may be due to the natural course of back pain, the promising responses justify further research. The procedures used in the study are appropriate for a randomized controlled trial. Drop-out could be reduced by more careful patient monitoring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic neck pain is a common condition in the adult population. More research is needed to evaluate interventions aiming to facilitate beneficial long-term change. We propose to evaluate the effect of Alexander Technique lessons and acupuncture in a rigorously conducted pragmatic trial with an embedded qualitative study. METHODS/DESIGN: We will recruit 500 patients who have been diagnosed with neck pain in primary care, who have continued to experience neck pain for at least three months with 28% minimum cut-off score on the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). We will exclude patients with serious underlying pathology, prior cervical spine surgery, history of psychosis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis, haemophilia, cancer, HIV or hepatitis, or with alcohol or drug dependency currently or in the last 12 months, or actively pursuing compensation or with pending litigation. The York Trials Unit will randomly allocate participants using a secure computer-based system. We will use block randomisation with allocation to each intervention arm being unambiguously concealed from anyone who might subvert the randomisation process. Participants will be randomised in equal proportions to Alexander Technique lessons, acupuncture or usual care alone. Twenty 30-minute Alexander Technique lessons will be provided by teachers registered with the Society of Teachers of the Alexander Technique and twelve 50-minute sessions of acupuncture will be provided by acupuncturists registered with the British Acupuncture Council. All participants will continue to receive usual GP care. The primary outcome will be the NPQ at 12 months, with the secondary time point at 6 months, and an area-under-curve analysis will include 3, 6 and 12 month time-points. Adverse events will be documented. Potential intervention effect modifiers and mediators to be explored include: self-efficacy, stress management, and the incorporation of practitioner advice about self-care and lifestyle. Qualitative material will be used to address issues of safety, acceptability and factors that impact on longer term outcomes. DISCUSSION: This study will provide robust evidence on whether there are significant clinical benefits to patients, economic benefits demonstrating value for money, and sufficient levels of acceptability and safety. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN15186354.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN.: Cross-sectional and longitudinal designs within a prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE.: Translation of Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire (FFbH-R) into Norwegian and examination of its factor structure, internal consistency, reproducibility, construct validity, and responsiveness in patients with long-lasting back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Several condition-specific instruments have been developed to evaluate functional status in low back pain, but FFbH-R was the only instrument found to solely measure perceived capability of performing daily activities. METHODS.: Recommended guidelines for translation of questionnaires and quality criteria for validation were followed. A total of 111 patients (aged 18-65 years) with long-lasting back pain were consecutively recruited from an outpatient spine clinic. Two additional samples of patients with long-lasting back pain were added into the exploratory factor analysis, giving a total number of 224 patients. Predefined hypotheses regarding construct and longitudinal validity (responsiveness) were examined. RESULTS.: Factor analysis indicated that 2 items should be removed, resulting in a 3-factor solution as the best fit. The factors were related to flexibility, dynamic strength, and posture endurance. Satisfactory internal consistency and reproducibility were demonstrated for the total and subscales of the Norwegian version of FFbH-R. Most of the predefined hypothesis regarding construct and longitudinal validity were confirmed, and discriminate ability was shown. Minor floor and ceiling effects were demonstrated. CONCLUSION.: Psychometric properties of the Norwegian version of FFbH-R were satisfactory in patients with long-lasting back pain, but the dynamic strength and posture endurance subscales might be complemented with additional items.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient perceptions may influence the effectiveness and utilization of healthcare interventions, particularly for complex health conditions such as sciatica or back-related leg pain (BRLP). OBJECTIVES: To explore BRLP patients' perceptions of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and home exercise with advice (HEA). DESIGN: Qualitative study in a controlled clinical trial. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews conducted after 12 weeks of treatment asked participants about satisfaction with care and whether treatment was worthwhile. An interdisciplinary research team conducted content analysis using qualitative data analysis software to identify and summarize themes. RESULTS: Of 192 trial participants, 174 (91%) completed interviews (66% female, age 57.0 +/- 11.5 years). Participants identified interactions with providers and staff, perceived treatment effects, and information as key contributors to both their satisfaction and the worthwhile nature of treatment. HEA was liked for its convenience and ability to foster an exercise habit. SMT was liked for specific aspects of the modality (e.g. manipulation, stretching) and provider competency. Most participants reported no dislikes for SMT or HEA, but some noted the dose/time commitment for SMT and discipline of HEA as least liked aspects of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of patient-provider interactions, perceived treatment effects, and information sharing influenced BRLP patients' satisfaction with care. Qualitative research describing patients' preferences can facilitate translation of study findings into practice and allow clinicians to tailor treatments to facilitate compliance and satisfaction with care.

AB  - PurposeTo translate and cross-culturally adapt the Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ) into modern standard Arabic and examine its validity, acceptability and reliability in Arabic-speaking patients with low back pain (LBP).MethodThe BBQ was forward, back-translated and reviewed by an expert committee. Seventeen bilingual patients completed Arabic and English BBQs. LBP patients (n = 199) completed the Arabic BBQ. Sixty-four repeated it a week later, and 151 completed the Arabic Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ).ResultsThe expert committee followed advice from the developers to maintain Arabic equivalence of “back trouble(s)”. Patients found the questionnaire comprehensible and acceptable. Agreement between the English and Arabic versions of the BBQ was acceptable, ICC = 0.65 (0.25–0.86). Most item-by-item agreement ranged from fair to moderate (K = 0.12–0.54). Mean (SD) of BBQ, FABQ total, work and physical activity subscales were 25.31(6.13), 44.76(19.49), 21.17(10.10) and 13.95(6.65). The BBQ correlated with the FABQ atr = −0.33, work subscaler = −0.29 and physical activityr = −0.30 (allp < 0.01). Cronbach’sα = 0.73 indicated high internal consistency. Test–retest reliability was high, ICC = 0.80 (0.68–0.87). Item-by-item agreement ranged from fair to acceptable (K = 0.31–0.66).ConclusionsThe Arabic BBQ has good comprehensibility and acceptability, acceptable agreement with the English BBQ, high internal consistency and test–retest reliability. We recommend its use with Arabic-speaking LBP patient to determine their beliefs and attitudes about their back pain, as they have been shown to be important predictors of persistent LBP disability.Implications for RehabilitationThere are limited valid and reliable outcome measures for back pain in Arabic. The Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ) is a tool that measures attitudes and beliefs about back pain.We recommend the use of our valid and reliable, translated and cross-culturally adapted tool with Arabic-speaking patients.The tool can measure attitudes and beliefs concerning the future consequences of LBP, with regards to recovery and return to work in this sample.Findings will improve back pain management options aimed at reducing back pain disability though challenging and modifying beliefs in the Middle East or with migrant populations in the West.

AB  - Adults over the age of 65 years are now the fastest growing segment of the Canadian population. Although individual differences exist, aging is commonly associated with impairments in executive function and episodic memory. Previous studies have shown that mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) can improve cognitive function in healthy younger adults, but no studies have yet examined this effect in older adults. The present study investigated the effectiveness of MBSR on improving executive function and episodic memory in older adult as well as its effectiveness in improving perceived stress and well-being. Ninety-seven healthy older adults were randomly assigned to either MBSR (n = 57) or an active control group (n = 40). It was hypothesized that compared with the control group, the MBSR group would display significant improvements in measures of executive function, episodic memory, mindfulness, mood, self-esteem, and quality of life. No clinically meaningful changes were found on any variable. In light of these results, the value of MBSR for this population is discussed.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the diagnostic validity and therapeutic value of lumbar facet joint interventions in managing chronic low back pain. METHODS: The review process applied systematic evidence-based assessment methodology of controlled trials of diagnostic validity and randomized controlled trials of therapeutic efficacy. Inclusion criteria encompassed all facet joint interventions performed in a controlled fashion. The pain relief of greater than 50% was the outcome measure for diagnostic accuracy assessment of the controlled studies with ability to perform previously painful movements, whereas, for randomized controlled therapeutic efficacy studies, the primary outcome was significant pain relief and the secondary outcome was a positive change in functional status. For the inclusion of the diagnostic controlled studies, all studies must have utilized either placebo controlled facet joint blocks or comparative local anesthetic blocks. In assessing therapeutic interventions, short-term and long-term reliefs were defined as either up to 6 mo or greater than 6 mo of relief. The literature search was extensive utilizing various types of electronic search media including PubMed from 1966 onwards, Cochrane library, National Guideline Clearinghouse, clinicaltrials.gov, along with other sources including previous systematic reviews, non-indexed journals, and abstracts until March 2015. Each manuscript included in the assessment was assessed for methodologic quality or risk of bias assessment utilizing the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies checklist for diagnostic interventions, and Cochrane review criteria and the Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment tool for therapeutic interventions. Evidence based on the review of the systematic assessment of controlled studies was graded utilizing a modified schema of qualitative evidence with best evidence synthesis, variable from level I to level V. RESULTS: Across all databases, 16 high quality diagnostic accuracy studies were identified. In addition, multiple studies assessed the influence of multiple factors on diagnostic validity. In contrast to diagnostic validity studies, therapeutic efficacy trials were limited to a total of 14 randomized controlled trials, assessing the efficacy of intraarticular injections, facet or zygapophysial joint nerve blocks, and radiofrequency neurotomy of the innervation of the facet joints. The evidence for the diagnostic validity of lumbar facet joint nerve blocks with at least 75% pain relief with ability to perform previously painful movements was level I, based on a range of level I to V derived from a best evidence synthesis. For therapeutic interventions, the evidence was variable from level II to III, with level II evidence for lumbar facet joint nerve blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy for long-term improvement (greater than 6 mo), and level III evidence for lumbosacral zygapophysial joint injections for short-term improvement only. CONCLUSION: This review provides significant evidence for the diagnostic validity of facet joint nerve blocks, and moderate evidence for therapeutic radiofrequency neurotomy and therapeutic facet joint nerve blocks in managing chronic low back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The intervertebral disc has been implicated as a major cause of chronic spinal pain based on clinical, basic science, and epidemiological research. There is, however, a lack of consensus regarding the diagnosis and treatment of intervertebral disc disorders. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discs have been shown to be the source of chronic back pain without disc herniation in 26% to 39% of patients, and in 16% to 53% of patients with pain in the cervical spine. Lumbar, cervical, and thoracic provocation discography, which includes disc stimulation and morphological evaluation, is often used to distinguish a painful disc from other potential sources of pain. Despite the extensive literature on point, intense debate continues about lumbar discography as a diagnostic tool. STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of lumbar, cervical, and thoracic provocation and analgesic discography literature. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess and re-evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of lumbar, cervical, and thoracic discography. METHODS: The available literature on discography was reviewed. A methodological quality assessment of included studies was performed using the Quality Appraisal of Reliability Studies (QAREL) checklist. Only diagnostic accuracy studies meeting at least 50% of the designated inclusion criteria were included in the analysis. To assess the level of evidence, a modified grading of qualitative evidence criteria was utilized, with grading of evidence into 5 categories from Level I to Level V incorporating evidence obtained from multiple high quality diagnostic accuracy studies for Level I and opinion or consensus of a large group of clinicians and/or scientists for Level V. Data sources included relevant literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to June 2017, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. RESULTS: Over 100 manuscripts were considered for inclusion. Of these, 8 studies met inclusion criteria for diagnostic accuracy and prevalence with 5 studies assessing lumbar provocation discography and 3 studies assessing cervical discography. The results showed variable prevalence from 16.9% to 26% for discogenic pain and 16.9% to 42% for internal disc disruption. The cervical discogenic pain prevalence ranged from 16% to 53%. Based on methodological quality assessment criteria the strength of evidence for lumbar provocation discography is Level III and for cervical discogenic pain is Level IV. LIMITATIONS: Despite multiple publications in the lumbar spine, value and validity of discography continues to be debated. In reference to cervical and thoracic discography, the available literature and value and validity continues to be low. CONCLUSION: This systematic review illustrates that lumbar provocation discography performed according to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) criteria may be a useful tool for evaluating chronic lumbar discogenic pain. The evidence is weaker for cervical and nonexistent for thoracic discography. KEY WORDS: Lumbar intervertebral disc, cervical intervertebral disc, thoracic intervertebral disc, discography, provocation discography, analgesic discography, diagnostic accuracy, prevalence.

AB  - Background: Symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition affecting a growing number of individuals resulting in significant disability and pain, leading to a multitude of interventions ranging from simple over the counter medication to opioids, and, finally, to complex surgical fusions. After failure of conservative treatment with drug therapy, physical therapy, and other conservative modalities including epidural injections, percutaneous adhesiolysis with targeted delivery of drugs into the epidural space can be offered in lumbar central spinal stenosis prior to minimally invasive surgical options or complex surgical fusions. To date there has been only one systematic review which has assessed the role of percutaneous adhesiolysis in treating central spinal stenosis, compared to post lumbar surgery syndrome which has multiple systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Study Design: A systematic review of RCTs and observational studies assessing the role of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing lumbar central spinal stenosis.Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing central lumbar spinal stenosis, utilizing currently available literature.Methods: This systematic review was performed utilizing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for literature search, Cochrane review criteria, Interventional Pain Management techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB), and Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment for Nonrandomized Studies (IPM-QRBNR) to assess methodologic quality assessment and qualitative analysis utilizing best evidence synthesis principles, and meta-analysis.PubMed, Cochrane library, US National Guideline Clearinghouse, Google Scholar, and prior systematic reviews and reference lists were utilized in the literature search from 1966 through June 2019. The evidence was summarized utilizing principles of the best evidence synthesis on a scale of 1 to 5.Outcome Measures: The primary outcome or hard endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients with 50% pain relief and improvement in functionality, whereas the secondary outcome measures or soft endpoints were pain relief and/or improvement in functionality. Short-term effectiveness was defined as improvement of 6 months or less, whereas long-term effectiveness was defined as more than 6 months.Results: Based on search criteria, 9 manuscripts were identified and considered for inclusion with final inclusion of 2 RCTs and 4 observational studies in this systematic review and 5 studies for single arm meta-analysis. The results showed Level II evidence for short-term and long-term improvement in pain and function with application of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing central lumbar spinal stenosis.Limitations: There was a significant paucity of evidence assessing the role of percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing lumbar central spinal stenosis, leading to Level II or strong evidence.Conclusion: Overall, the present analysis shows Level II (moderate) evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing lumbar central spinal stenosis based on relevant high quality RCTs and observational studies.Key Words: Lumbar central spinal stenosis, percutaneous adhesiolysis, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, neuroplasty.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: This article reviews some of the advances that have taken place in understanding back disorders, with a particular emphasis on low back pain, as this area has been most represented in the literature in the preceding year (September 2003 to September 2004).Recent Findings: Epidemiological studies continue to provide insights into the prevalence of back pain and have identified many individual, psychosocial, and occupational risk factors for its onset. Psychological factors have an important role in the transition from acute to chronic pain and related disability. Recent advances show that there is a significant genetic effect on severe low back pain in the community. Data emerging from candidate gene studies show an association between lumbar disc disease and mutations of genes encoding the alpha-2 and alpha-3 subunits of collagen IX.Summary: Back pain is among the most common conditions for which patients seek medical care. Interventions based on behavioral and cognitive principles and exercise programs are effective in improving disability in chronic back pain. Although progress has been made in understanding the role of genetic mutations in disorders such as lumbar disc disease, further investigation of the interaction between genetic and environmental factors such as physical stress is needed.

AB  - Sixty-two patients with chronic low back pain occurring 14-60 months after undergoing discectomy for the first time were randomized to two physical treatment groups: 24 sessions of intensive dynamic back exercises with hyperextension or 24 sessions of intensive dynamic back exercises without hyperextension. At the conclusion of therapy and at one-year follow-up, no difference was seen between the randomized groups, with regard to the combined assessments of pain, disability and objective measurements. A difference for back exercises without hyperextension to be superior to the other treatment regimen was statistically significant at the three-month follow-up. In the patient's qualitative assessment of treatment outcome there were seen no significant differences between back exercises with or without hyperextension. There was a similar and significant improvement of the isometric endurance of back muscles in both groups, but the flexibility of the spine was significantly improved only in the group using hyperextension exercises. The overall response rate of an earlier published investigation was reproduced. It is concluded that chronic back patients after first time discectomy may benefit from an intensive rehabilitation protocol including intensive exercises. The added use of hyperextension exercises does not confer any independent benefit. Furthermore, the training had to continue for more than 2-3 months before a statistical significant decrease in back pain was reported in the patient pain diary.

Content analysis was used to identify categories and themes arising from the data.Results:The findings from the study are broader than the original objective to explore information needs and service delivery options to promote long-term health. The participants more globally discussed factors that contribute to or provide barriers to their long-term health. Those factors are captured in five categories, including readiness, information pathways, community health care, health promotion, and contextual factors. A framework that illustrates the relationships between categories was constructed.Conclusion:The framework identifies areas to target in programmes designed to reduce or prevent secondary conditions in people with SCI.Sponsorship:This study was funded by the Alberta Paraplegic Foundation and the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation.Spinal Cord (2007) 45, 411-419; doi:10.1038/sj.sc.3101973; published online 26 September 2006.

AB  - Mindfulness meditation is an ancient and simple form of meditation that has been said to induce several important physical and psychological benefits. The present study was designed with the aim of investigating the psychobiological effects of mindfulness meditation practice in a clinical population. Sixteen patients with depression and anxiety symptoms were submitted to a mindfulness meditation programme for the period of 2 months. Psychological well-being [5-item Mental Health (MH-5)] and several endocrine parameters [adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS), thyroid-stimulating hormone, triiodothyronine, thyroxine and parathyroid hormone (PTH)] were assessed before and after the meditation programme. At post-test, the MH-5 score improved, while the levels of DHEAS and ACTH were raised, and those of PTH decreased. Our results suggest that mindfulness meditation can exert a significant psychobiological modulation by enhancing psychological well-being, as well as by regulating the levels of several hormonal parameters on different axes.

AB  - Introduction: Population aging is a global phenomenon that has grown rapidly and progressively all over the world. Interventions that promote health must be studied and implemented to make the aging process be with quality of life. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health conditions that compromise the quality of life on the elderly and it can cause damage to the autonomy and activities of daily life. Mindfulness training has been shown to improve psychological health and quality of life on adults. Studies involving Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) with older people are scarce in the literature, but they have been increasing in recent years showing promising results for healthy aging. This trial will investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an MBI on the quality of life of elderly assisted in the Primary Care. Materials and Methods: A cohort-nested randomized controlled trial with 3 assessment points (baseline, post-intervention and 1-year follow up) will be conducted to compare a MBI program (Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion) to a cognitive stimulation control-group in a Primary Care facility. One-hundred and two older adults will be recruited from a cohort of this facility and they will be randomized and allocated into an intervention group (N = 76) and the control group (N = 76). The primary outcome evaluated will be the improvement of quality of life assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-OLD. The secondary outcomes will be cognitive function, psychological health, sleep quality, self-compassion, and religiosity. Qualitative data will be assessed by focus group and the word free evocation technique. The feasibility of the program will also be evaluated by adherence and unwanted effects questionnaires. Discussion: This cohort-nested clinical trial will be the first mixed-methods study with 3 assessment points which will study the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a mindfulness-based program for older people in Latin America population. If the findings of this study confirm the effectiveness of this program in this population it will be possible to consider it as intervention that might be implemented as public policy addressed to older people in healthcare systems.

AB  - Although the concept of chronic pain has been studied extensively in the literature, little is known about the meaning of chronic pain to individuals with low back pain. This phenomenological study examined the meaning of chronic pain to individuals with low back pain. The sample consisted of 15 subjects (9 males and 6 females), 27 to 70 years of age. Data were gathered from the subjects by interviews and then analyzed using Giorgi's method of data analysis. The researcher used bracketing while analyzing the data to prevent any preconceived ideas from influencing the analysis. The findings were that chronic low back pain is a multidimensional experience which affects every aspect of an individual's life. The meaning of pain varied in the intensity of its impact among individuals and focused on two areas: altered life style and how one's overall life was affected. Individuals discussed how pain dominated their life and that life would never be the same again. A conclusion derived from the study was that chronic pain is a complex phenomenon which has a negative impact on the individual. This conclusion lead to a recommendation that variables be examined to determine which ones positively influence the individual's ability to live with chronic pain. Further study should include both qualitative and quantitative approach methods to obtain a more complete description of the pain experiences.

AB  - (1) Background: Using new technologies to manage home exercise programmes is an approach that allows more patients to benefit from therapy. The objective of this study is to explore physical therapists' opinions of the efficacy and disadvantages of implementing a web-based telerehabilitation programme for treating chronic low back pain (CLBP). (2) Methods: Nineteen physical therapists from academic and healthcare fields in both the public and private sector participated in the qualitative study. Texts extracted from a transcript of semi-structured, individual, in-depth interviews with each consenting participant were analysed to obtain the participants' prevailing opinions. The interviews lasted approximately 40 min each. The participants' responses were recorded. (3) Results: The results suggest that telerehabilitation can only be successful if patients become actively involved in their own treatment. However, exercise programmes for LBP are not always adapted to patient preferences. New technologies allow physical therapists to provide their patients with the follow-up and remote contact they demand, but long-term adherence to treatment stems from knowledge of the exercises and the correct techniques employed by the patients themselves. (4) Conclusions: Physical therapists treating patients with chronic non-specific low back pain believe that new technologies can provide highly effective means of reaching a greater number of patients and achieving significant savings in healthcare costs, despite the limitations of a telerehabilitation approach in developing an appropriate and effective patient-based physiotherapy programme.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors potentially influencing patient self-evaluation of chronic low back pain (CLBP) and their interactions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The impact of the time, context, and/or recall on the self-assessment of chronic pain intensity remains poorly understood. METHODS: A prospective study investigated patients' CLBP intensity over 29 days. Patients were evaluated on days 1 and 29 by the investigator with a pain intensity visual analog scale (0-100), and interviewed by phone on days 8, 15, and 22 to 28 to evaluate pain intensity with a numerical rating scale (0-10), either thrice daily (time-associated group), or during rest/activities (activity-associated group). Current and/or recalled pain intensities were also assessed. Means of recorded pain intensity and overall assessment of patient's pain intensity of the day were subjected to statistical analyses with analysis of variance and test of correlation. RESULTS: Among the 203 patients included, 194 (56.2% women; mean age: 47.5 +/- 12.1 year) were considered in the analysis (9 patients were not followed until day 24). Strong correlations were obtained between mean pain intensity (time-associated group = 44 patients) and overall assessment of pain intensity of the day. Strong correlations were also obtained between overall assessment of pain intensity of the day and intensity measured during each activity, but not between current pain intensity and remembered pain 24 of 48 hours earlier (activity-associated group = 150 patients). Recalled pain intensities for the last 7 or 28 days were strongly correlated with current pain intensity, but the correlations were markedly weaker after adjustment for day 29-pain intensity. CONCLUSION: For CLBP patients, overall assessment of pain intensity of the day at evening is accurate to assess pain on 1 day. Overall assessment of pain intensity of the day is very close with usual pain. Furthermore, 24 and 48 hours remembered pain intensity are not accurate measures. Recalls of pain on the 7 or 28 last days were very dependant of the pain intensity of the day of the assessment. These findings could contribute to improving pain intensity assessment in CLBP patients avoiding multiple assessments, especially during clinical trials.

AB  - This article presents a study on the care provided by 11 men from different ethnic, health, and socioeconomic backgrounds to two indigenous Raramuri males with ankylosing spondylitis. This chronic muscular and bone disease is known to evolve progressively, causing disability and immense suffering to the affected individual. Through anthropological research involving ethnographic description and interviews conducted in an urban setting of the City of Chihuahua in the state of Chihuahua, caring practices performed by men that contest prior assumptions about how men relate to each other in relation to their health and masculinity were encountered. To interpret findings, a "caring of the self" framework, along with elements of the discussion of personhood and masculinities, was used; this led to an analysis made through the elaboration of meaningful coding of patterns of caring practices. The patterns identified in the ethnographic data were organized into four groups, all of which represented caring practices performed by these men. The first three groups involve access to food, money, and infrastructure goods, which have a material nature that holds a positive relation to the well-being of the two Raramuri males in regard to the implications of their disease. The last group is unique in that it pertains to circumstantial factors that required improvisations in the forms of favors exchanged by these males that also positively related to their well-being.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain complaints are the second most common reason for outpatient primary care visits, yet a comprehensive assessment of the processes and experiences of providers during a chronic pain visit is still lacking. This qualitative descriptive study aimed to conceptualize the processes and experiences that military primary care providers go through while they assess and manage chronic pain. SETTING: Single US Army medical center. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 12 military primary care providers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded using qualitative software. Transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify emergent themes. RESULTS: Three broad themes with associated sub-themes captured the processes and providers' experiences: 1) comprehending the pain story - asking the right questions regarding pain impact, navigating through complexities of the pain story, and conveying understanding of pain story back to the patient; 2) optimizing the pain story - perception of provider-patient disconnect on pain management goals, re-setting realistic goals, creating optimal individualized treatment plan, and evaluating treatment effectiveness; and 3) empathetic and therapeutic engagement with patients - trusting patients and fostering patient-provider relationship. A thematic map illustrates these provider experiences. CONCLUSIONS: During chronic pain visits, the provider-patient disconnect on goals of chronic pain treatment presents a considerable challenge. Further in-depth studies on addressing provider-patient disconnect are warranted to identify solutions, which would help providers communicate realistic chronic pain management expectations to patients. The themes and sub-themes described in this study could serve as a guide for directing strategies to improve chronic pain visits in primary care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Motivation has long been emphasized as the most important determinant of action. However, there is a substantial gap between people's goals and their attainment. Patients may be motivated and yet unable to take action if their volitional competencies are insufficient. One of the important tasks of volition is goal-maintenance. Research has stressed the importance of a volitional tool, the implementation intentions. Implementation intentions indicate where, when, and how the action leading to the goal will be performed. Forming implementation intentions favours the execution of goal-directed efforts, and reinforces the relationship between intentions and behaviours. Results from various studies clearly suggest that volitional competencies and implementation intentions could play a role in low back pain (LBP) patients. However, there is at present no questionnaire allowing assessing the capacity of implementation intentions of physical activities in LBP patients. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will develop such a questionnaire, using a 3-step approach. A first qualitative step to build categories and generate items; 30 patients suffering chronic LBP will be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews; verbatim and derived items will then be submitted to a panel of experts, using a Delphi method; a second quantitative step to examine the properties of items, and determine the factorial structure of the questionnaire; 100 patients suffering chronic LBP will be recruited to respond to this phase; and third, preliminary psychometric analyses (item-scale correlations, construct validity, reliability); 180 chronic LBP patients will be recruited for this phase of the study. The relationships between implementation intentions and variables affecting physical activity on chronic LBP patients, i.e. pain, physical capacities, fear-avoidance beliefs, kinesiophobia, work status, and level of physical activity will be considered. DISCUSSION: Developing a questionnaire to assess implementation intentions would allow investigating the role of these intentions in the transition from acute to chronic LBP. The results of this study should contribute to the understanding of the psychological processes at stake in the development of chronic LBP, and in particular to the identification of factors eventually favouring patients' participation in and adherence to active physical treatments.

AB  - PURPOSE: Previous work has shown that information technology (IT), such as personal computers and other digital devices (e.g. tablets, laptops, etc.), software, online resources and hand-held communication tools (e.g. cellphones), has benefits for health and well-being for persons with chronic health conditions. To date, the ways that persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) use IT in their daily activities has not been fully explored. Thus, the purpose of the study was to obtain an in-depth perspective of how people with SCI regularly use IT to gain insight on ways IT can be used to support health and well-being in the community for this population. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community-dwelling persons with SCI (N = 10) who identified themselves as frequent-or-daily-users of IT. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify the ways that persons with SCI use personal IT. RESULTS: Ten themes related to IT use were identified: (1) Modifications allowing access to IT; (2) Convenience of IT and its perceived value; (3) IT as a scheduler/planner; (4) Challenges; (5) Contributions of IT to participation; (6) Access to information; (7) Influence of IT on well-being; (8) IT as a connector; (9) Issues of IT acquisition; and (10) Desires for future devices/technology. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that IT use by people with SCI contributes to general health and well-being, by increasing access to SCI-related health information and opportunity for social participation. Despite the benefits offered by IT, persons with SCI have identified a degree of skepticism about the reliability and applicability of the health information they find online. Future work on developing and implementing IT for health and well-being post-SCI should take into account consumers' perspectives to facilitate uptake. Implications for Rehabilitation There is a need for a more refined understanding of how people with spinal cord injury (SCI) use information technology (IT) in their daily lives in order to understand how IT can support health and well-being post-injury in the community. IT use holds implications for the physical and mental well-being of persons with SCI. IT allows access to a variety of information, and facilitates participation in the community. The enthusiasm for the use of IT is tempered by a degree of skepticism about the reliability and applicability of the health information available online. This highlights the need to raise awareness of existing sources vetted for this population, and to develop content that meets the particular health needs for SCI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic pain is prevalent, costly, and is associated with profound psychological effects. Although pain is prevalent in returning veterans of the recent military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn [OEF/OIF/OND] Veterans), little is known about chronic pain in these patients. This study's objective was to ascertain perceptions of a multicomponent intervention tested in a randomized controlled trial for OEF/OIF/OND veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain (Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain [ESCAPE]). DESIGN: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 26 patients in the intervention arm of ESCAPE (21% of total intervention patients) to determine patients' experiences with and perceptions of the intervention. Patients were purposefully sampled to include treatment responders (defined as >=30% reduction in pain-related disability or pain severity), nonresponders, and noncompleters (completed <50% of trial). Qualitative analysis was guided by grounded theory. RESULTS: Both responders and nonresponders discussed the importance of the self-management education they received. Of particular significance, patients identified the nurse care manager who administered the intervention as being integral to patients' ability to self-manage their chronic pain. Patients described important ways in which the nurse facilitated their self-management, reported under three themes: 1) helping patients find what works for their pain; 2) holding patients accountable for their pain management; 3) motivating and providing emotional support to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Results corroborate previous work and suggest that current conceptualizations of self-management are incomplete. A model is proposed that not only depicts self-management as involving more than activities and strategies, but also acknowledges the central role of relationships and support in pain self-management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the perceived disadvantages caused by low back pain in work, household chores and leisure-time activities, as expressed by patients themselves. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: Structured telephone interviews, carried out among a sample of 39 physician referrals (29 women and 10 men) for non-specific chronic low back pain to University Hospital, Turku, covered how low back pain affected their daily living, with separate sections for work, household chores and leisure time. Disadvantages in daily activities were measured using numeric rating scales (0-100). The differences between scores for ability to perform with low back pain and for expected performance if the subject did not have low back pain were used to depict the disadvantage in each activity. RESULTS: Men reported a greater disadvantage than women in work, household chores and leisure-time activities. The ability to perform in any of the 3 daily activities was associated with an ability to perform in the others. Good performance at work was reported by 81.0% of the women and 42.9% of the men. Because of low back pain, leisure-time activities had been reduced by 82.1% of the patients and, out of them, 64.1% had completely given up at least one leisure-time activity. CONCLUSION: When estimating the overall burden of low back pain, the measure of work-related loss of productivity should be complemented by measures of performance in household chores and limitations to leisure-time activities. To depict extensively the burden to the patients, such measures should be based on the activities the patients consider important. These are best determined by using the phrasings and expressions the patients themselves use.

AB  - How family doctors conceptualise chronic illness in the consultation has important implications for both the delivery of medical care, and its experience by patients. In this paper, we present the results of a re-analysis of qualitative data collected in a series of studies of British family doctors between 1995 and 2001, to explore the ways in which the legitimacy and authority of medical knowledge and practice are organised and worked out in relation to three kinds of chronic illness (menorrhagia; depression; and chronic low back pain/medically unexplained symptoms). We present a comparative analysis of (a). the moral evaluation of the patient (and judgements about the legitimacy of symptom presentation); (b). the possibilities of disposal; and (c). doctors' empathic responses to the patient, in each of these clinical cases. Our analysis defines some of the fundamental conditions through which general practitioners frame their relationships with patients presenting complex but sometimes diffuse combinations of 'social', 'psychological' and 'medical' symptoms. These are fundamental to, yet barely touched by, the increasingly voluminous literature on how doctors should interact with patients. Moving beyond the individual studies from which our data are drawn, we have outlined some of the highly complex and demanding features of what is often seen as routine and unrewarding medical work, and some of the key requirements for the local negotiation of patients' problems and their meanings (for both patients and doctors) in everyday general practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding how new clinical techniques, technologies and other complex interventions become normalized in practice is important to researchers, clinicians, health service managers and policy-makers. This paper presents a model of the normalization of complex interventions. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2005 multiple qualitative studies were undertaken. These examined: professional-patient relationships; changing patterns of care; the development, evaluation and implementation of telemedicine and related informatics systems; and the production and utilization of evidence for practice. Data from these studies were subjected to (i) formative re-analysis, leading to sets of analytic propositions; and to (ii) a summative analysis that aimed to build a robust conceptual model of the normalization of complex interventions in health care. RESULTS: A normalization process model that enables analysis of the conditions necessary to support the introduction of complex interventions is presented. The model is defined by four constructs: interactional workability; relational integration; skill set workability and contextual integration. This model can be used to understand the normalization potential of new techniques and technologies in healthcare settings CONCLUSION: The normalization process model has face validity in (i) assessing the potential for complex interventions to become routinely embedded in everyday clinical work, and (ii) evaluating the factors that promote or inhibit their success and failure in practice.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the literature to determine if stabilisation exercises are effective for the treatment of pain and dysfunction in patients with low back pain.Data sources: PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL, AMED, PEDro and the Cochrane Library were searched up to October 2006.Review methods: Inclusion criteria were: randomised clinical trials; in English; full publications; subjects were adults with low back pain; one group received specific stabilisation exercises as the primary intervention; and outcome measures included some measure of pain and/or function. Following a systematic search of major databases, articles were scored according to the PEDro criteria for quality. Due to heterogeneity of specific interventions, control groups, duration of follow-up, outcome measures and study population, a meta-analysis was not conducted. A qualitative review was undertaken that focused on study quality, study population and type of control group.Results: In total, 18 trials were included in the review; a large number of trials were excluded. There was little evidence to support the use of stabilisation exercises for acute low back pain. There was some evidence to support the use of stabilisation exercises in chronic back pain, with the majority of high-quality trials showing a significant difference in favour of stabilisation exercises. Overall, however, the evidence was conflicting, and significant differences favouring stabilisation exercises were less likely when they were compared with active treatment control groups rather than inactive control groups.Conclusions: There may be a role for specific stabilisation exercises in some patients with chronic low back pain, but these are no more effective than other active interventions.

AB  - This qualitative research article is based on interviews with 20 participants to a low back pain rehabilitation program in a Swiss hospital. It shows that, in the absence of the obvious cause that can explain pain, patients construct their own interpretations and explanations in order to give meaning to their experience. Their explanatory models mainly include the lifestyle and the physical aspects related to the body function, what leaves little room for the psychosocial component. Their interpretation is consequently discordant with the current medical approach, which considers that chronic low back pain results from bio-psycho-social factors. This discrepancy implies negotiation between patients and professionals about the objectives to achieve in order to treat pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomised controlled trial evidence indicates that Alexander Technique is clinically and cost effective for chronic back pain. The aim of this mixed methods evaluation was to explore the role and perceived impact of Alexander Technique lessons in the naturalistic setting of an acute hospital Pain Management Clinic in England. METHODS: To capture changes in health status and resource use amongst service users, 43 service users were administered three widely used questionnaires (Brief Pain Inventory, MYMOP and Client Service Resource Inventory) at three time points: baseline, six weeks and three months after baseline. We also carried out 27 telephone interviews with service users and seven face-to-face interviews with pain clinic staff and Alexander Technique teachers. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Those taking Alexander Technique lessons reported small improvements in health outcomes, and condition-related costs fell. However, due to the non-randomised, uncontrolled nature of the study design, changes cannot be attributed to the Alexander Technique lessons. Service users stated that their relationship to pain and pain management had changed, especially those who were more committed to practising the techniques regularly. These changes may explain the reported reduction in pain-related service use and the corresponding lower associated costs. CONCLUSIONS: Alexander Technique lessons may be used as another approach to pain management. The findings suggests that Alexander Technique lessons can help improve self-efficacy for those who are sufficiently motivated, which in turn may have an impact on service utilisation levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual illness perceptions have been highlighted as important influences on clinical outcomes for back pain. However, the illness perceptions of 'significant others' (spouse/partner/close family member) are rarely explored, particularly in relation to persistent back pain and work participation. The aim of this study was to initiate qualitative research in this area in order to further understand these wider influences on outcome. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews based on the chronic pain version of the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised were conducted with a convenience sample of UK disability benefit claimants, along with their significant others (n = 5 dyads). Data were analysed using template analysis. RESULTS: Significant others shared, and perhaps further reinforced, claimants' unhelpful illness beliefs including fear of pain/re-injury associated with certain types of work and activity, and pessimism about the likelihood of return to work. In some cases, significant others appeared more resigned to the permanence and negative inevitable consequences of the claimant's back pain condition on work participation, and were more sceptical about the availability of suitable work and sympathy from employers. In their pursuit of authenticity, claimants were keen to stress their desire to work whilst emphasising how the severity and physical limitations of their condition prevented them from doing so. In this vein, and seemingly based on their perceptions of what makes a 'good' significant other, significant others acted as a 'witness to pain', supporting claimants' self-limiting behaviour and statements of incapacity, often responding with empathy and assistance. The beliefs and responses of significant others may also have been influenced by their own experience of chronic illness, thus participants lives were often intertwined and defined by illness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this exploratory study reveal how others and wider social circumstances might contribute both to the propensity of persistent back pain and to its consequences. This is an area that has received little attention to date, and wider support of these findings may usefully inform the design of future intervention programmes aimed at restoring work participation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment expectations form a fundamental component of the self-regulatory model of health behavior, which defines such cognitions as illness perceptions. Unrealistic and/or unhelpful treatment expectations have been linked to detrimental clinical and work outcomes in those with persistent low back pain. However, research of this nature has rarely focused on the influence of 'significant others' (spouse/partner/close family member). OBJECTIVE: To provide an in-depth examination of the treatment expectations of the 'significant others' of individuals who have become unable to work due to persistent low back pain, highlighting how significant others may influence recovery and work participation outcomes for such individuals. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample (n=18) of work disability benefit claimants and their significant others were recruited from two settings in the North of England. METHOD: A qualitative research design was employed, and semi-structured interviews based on the chronic pain version of the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised were conducted with claimants and their significant others. Interview data were analysed using template analysis. RESULTS: It was found that significant others expected a substantial reduction or complete removal of pain in order for treatment to be considered successful. The pursuit of diagnostic tests was important in validating such expectations, and there was continued scepticism of treatments already undertaken or offered as an alternative. Like the individuals affected, significant others believed that a correct diagnosis had not yet been received, which led to a continued delay in return to work. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that significant others have similar unrealistic and/or unhelpful treatment expectations to those widely reported by individuals with persistent low back pain, and could further reinforce such illness perceptions and serve as wider psychosocial obstacles to recovery and continued work participation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence supports the use of exercise-based treatment for chronic low back pain that encourages the patient to assume an active role in their recovery. Walking has been shown it to be an acceptable type of exercise with a low risk of injury. However, it is not known whether structured physical activity programmes are any more effective than giving advice to remain active. METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed study will test the feasibility of using a pedometer-driven walking programme, as an adjunct to a standard education and advice session in participants with chronic low back pain. Fifty adult participants will be recruited via a number of different sources. Baseline outcome measures including self reported function; objective physical activity levels; fear-avoidance beliefs and health-related quality of life will be recorded. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated under strict, double blind conditions to one of two treatments groups. Participants in group A will receive a single education and advice session with a physiotherapist based on the content of the 'Back Book'. Participants in group B will receive the same education and advice session. In addition, they will also receive a graded pedometer-driven walking programme prescribed by the physiotherapist. Follow up outcomes will be recorded by the same researcher, who will remain blinded to group allocation, at eight weeks and six months post randomisation. A qualitative exploration of participants' perception of walking will also be examined by use of focus groups at the end of the intervention. As a feasibility study, treatment effects will be represented by point estimates and confidence intervals. The assessment of participant satisfaction will be tabulated, as will adherence levels and any recorded difficulties or adverse events experienced by the participants or therapists. This information will be used to modify the planned interventions to be used in a larger randomised controlled trial. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the rationale and design of a study which will test the feasibility of using a structured, pedometer-driven walking programme in participants with chronic low back pain. Trial registration: [isrctn67030896].

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Clinicians have long hypothesized that gender may be a risk factor in treatment outcomes of patients with chronic disability associated with musculoskeletal disorders. Although the scientific literature shows a higher prevalence of occupational low back injury in men, and a higher rate of repetitive motion and neck injuries in women, few studies have comprehensively investigated the role of gender regarding cost-related outcome variables of significance after work-related injuries. PURPOSE: This study was designed to examine the relationship between gender and biopsychosocial treatment outcomes in a predominately chronically disabled spinal disorder (CDSD) workers' compensation cohort undergoing a tertiary functional restoration program. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective comparison cohort study investigating the effect of gender on biopsychosocial treatment outcomes as risk factors for rehabilitation failure. PATIENT SAMPLE: A cohort of 1,827 consecutively treated patients with CDSD were placed into two gender-based groups: men (n=1,158, average age 40.7+/-10 years) and women (n=669, average age 42.5+/-10 years). OUTCOME MEASURES: Before the start of the program, and again upon completion of the program, all patients received a standard psychosocial assessment and were assessed on a variety of physical factors (leading to a cumulative score, calculated on the basis of the aggregates and averages of these physical measures). A structured clinical interview examining socioeconomic outcomes was conducted at 1 year after program completion, and at least partial information was obtained from this interview on all patients in the present study. METHODS: All patients underwent a medically directed functional restoration program combining quantitatively guided exercise progression with a multimodal disability management approach using psychological and case management techniques. RESULTS: Men had a significantly higher rate of lumbar injury than women, whereas women had a significantly higher rate of cervical injury. Men returned to work and retained work at a 40 hours/week job at a higher rate at 1-year follow-up. Women evidenced a higher rate of health care-seeking behaviors from new providers. On physical testing immediately after treatment, men had a significantly higher cumulative physical score (gender normalized), both before and after treatment. On depression and disability questionnaires, men showed fewer pre- and posttreatment depressive symptoms with lower pretreatment disability scores. CONCLUSIONS: The present study represents the first large-scale examination of the relationship between gender and treatment outcomes for a population with CDSD after work injuries. There was a pattern of moderately better 1-year posttreatment socioeconomic outcome for men. On psychosocial measures, men showed lower disability and depression scores than women, with higher levels of physical functioning both before and after treatment. Overall, male patients with CDSD appeared to show somewhat better biopsychosocial outcomes. This leaves the question of identifying gender-specific risk factors to explain these differences.

AB  - Study Design: Six months of daily low back pain ratings for 94 individuals were tested for the influence of prevailing weather conditions during the spring, summer, and fall seasons. Intergroup differences were tested for study participants who reported weather sensitivity and for those who did not.Objectives: To investigate the relation between pain ratings and prevailing weather conditions in a population with chronic or recurrent low back pain.Summary Of Background Data: Weather conditions have been reported to influence pain perception in some disease states, including low back pain. Investigations of this relation in chronic or recurrent low back pain have involved varied methodologies, and conflicting results have been reported.Methods: The effects of eight weather variables reported to influence musculoskeletal pain were tested on daily pain ratings. A post hoc weather sensitivity questionnaire was used to disperse 73 individuals into groups based on perceived weather sensitivity, and group differences were tested.Results: Significant effects on pain scores were found, most notably for temperature and vapor pressure. The magnitude of the effects were small compared with autocorrelation of an individual's own pain scores. Significant differences were found between the group of individuals who were insensitive to weather conditions and that of individuals with perceived sensitivity to cold temperatures. No significant intergroup differences were found for damp, rainy conditions or changes in barometric pressure.Conclusions: Weather conditions may influence subjective reporting of low back pain significantly. Although the effects are small in magnitude, they should be considered in clinical treatment of the patient with chronic, nonspecific low back pain. Pain scores may demonstrate greater interaction with certain weather conditions in individuals perceiving sensitivity to those conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) has a prevalence similar to asthma and chronic back pain, but little is known about how general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses manage women with this problem. A clearer understanding of current management is necessary to develop appropriate strategies, in keeping with current health care policy, for the supported self-management of patients with long term conditions. The aim of this study was to explore GPs' and practice nurses' understanding and perspectives on the management of chronic pelvic pain. METHODS: Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 21 GPs and 20 practice nurses, in three primary care trusts in the North West of England. Data were analysed using the principles of Framework analysis. RESULTS: Analysis suggests that women who present with CPP pose a challenge to GPs and practice nurses. CPP is not necessarily recognized as a diagnostic label and making the diagnosis was achieved only by exclusion. This contrasts with the relative acceptability of labels such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). GPs expressed elements of therapeutic nihilism about the condition. Despite practice nurses taking on increasing responsibilities for the management of patients with long term conditions, respondents did not feel that CPP was an area that they were comfortable in managing. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates an educational/training need for both GPs and practice nurses. GPs described a number of skills and clinical competencies which could be harnessed to develop a more targeted management strategy. There is potential to develop facilitated self- management for use in this patient group, given that this approach has been successful in patients with similar conditions such as IBS.

AB  - Introduction  There are a growing number of older adults with combined age-related vision loss (ARVL) and dementia. Existing literature shows the pervasive impact that both diagnoses have separately on the participation of older adults, however, little is known about the societal participation of older adults with both conditions. As such, the aim of this scoping review was to explore the combined impact of ARVL and dementia on the participation of older adults, with a specific focus on highlighting strategies that help mitigate the impact of ARVL and dementia on participation.  Methods  This study utilized a scoping review, informed by the framework by Arksey and O\u0027Malley [1]. Two researchers independently ran a total of 62 search terms across four categories in six databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Medline, PsycINFO), with an initial yield of 2,053 articles. Grey literature was also included in this scoping review and was retrieved from organizational websites, brochures, conference proceedings, and a Google Scholar search. The application of study inclusion criteria resulted in a final yield of 13 empirical studies and 10 grey literature sources.  Results  Following detailed thematic analysis of the empirical and grey literature sources, four themes emerged regarding the impact of combined ARVL and dementia on the participation of older adults including: 1) Managing the pragmatic aspects of a dual diagnosis; 2) Diverse approaches to risk assessment and management; 3) Adopting a multi-disciplinary approach to facilitate care and; 4) Using compensatory strategies to facilitate participation.  Conclusions  The four themes highlight the challenges older adults with these combined diagnoses experience, which limit their opportunities for meaningful participation. Given the scarcity of research on this topic, future research should identify the type of ARVL and dementia diagnoses of study participants, conduct qualitative research about the lived experiences of older adults with a dual diagnosis, and broaden the geographic scope of research.

AB  - Systematic Review: Chronic pain and insomnia are highly comorbid, and evidence suggests a reciprocal relationship between these. CBT-I has been shown to improve sleep in those with chronic pain, therefore the potential of improved sleep leading to improvements in pain symptoms is a possibility. This led to the question: Does CBT-I improve pain symptoms in those with chronic pain and insomnia? A systematic review of the literature was conducted resulting in eight papers regarding six studies. Evidence was moderate that CBT-I improved sleep and pain related disability, but did not improve self reported pain levels. This discrepancy between improvements in pain related disability and no changes in self-reported pain levels led to the research question for the empirical element of the current thesis. .Empirical Element of Thesis Objective: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common form of chronic pain that affects a large population each year. Chronic pain and insomnia are highly comorbid conditions, yet knowledge about how patients perceive their interaction is limited. This qualitative study aims to inform our understanding of the patient experience with particular reference to beliefs and attributions surrounding pain, poor sleep and their interaction. .Methods: 11 outpatients from a chronic pain clinic were recruited who suffered CLBP as their main symptom, and who had subsequently developed insomnia as a result. Data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). .Results: Qualitative analysis produced five super-ordinate themes: 1) the privacy of pain and solitude of sleep; 2) sleep/pain interaction; 3) night-time thinking; 4) adjustment and acceptance; and 5) self-management. .Discussion: The first three themes combine to create the individual experience of CLBP: the visceral, emotional experience; the pre-existing and shifting beliefs; and the thought content. Once this is in place, the individual can reflect on what this means to them, and through acceptance, move through to adjustment. The individual accepts elements of their current experience, but where they see the opportunity to take control, these adjustments are translated into actions relating to self-management. These themes suggest CBT-I should be adapted to include pain specific beliefs to form a CBT for Insomnia and Chronic Pain (CBT-CPI)..

AB  - Purpose The prognosis of persistent back pain is variable, with some individuals adjusting poorly and others continuing to actively engage in work and other valued social roles. The aim of this study was to better understand why some individuals, despite persistent back pain, continue to actively engage in work and other valued social roles. Methods Individuals with persistent back pain, who were participating in their regular duties as a full-time employee, homemaker, student or any combination of these, were recruited from a multidisciplinary pain centre and orthopedic physical therapy clinics in Alberta, Canada. A qualitative study was conducted using semi-structured interviews of 15 participants and a thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results There were two motivators identified for participating in the work role: (1) participation formed part of the participant's self-schema (a cognitive framework that includes one's beliefs about oneself) and (2) participation made it possible to achieve a valued outcome. Conclusions Further understanding of important motivators for maintaining engagement in work and other valued social roles despite persistent back pain can help inform the development of more successful disability and pain management programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a research project to develop simple clinical criteria to aid in the identification of inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis and distinguish these from non-inflammatory conditions. The criteria are particularly intended to aid non-rheumatologists, e.g., dermatologists, who need assistance identifying psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis, but may be useful to all clinicians in properly diagnosing rheumatologic conditions. METHODS: The proposed research methodology includes the use of a nominal group exercise among expert clinicians and patient focus groups, Delphi exercises among clinicians and patients, application of criteria test sets to a small group of representative patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions, and validation by application of optimal criteria sets to large groups of patients with inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. RESULTS: Examples of elements to describe inflammatory conditions derived from a nominal group exercise conducted at the 2013 GRAPPA annual meeting are described, along with planned project activities. CONCLUSION: This project will lead to the development of practical criteria to aid in the diagnosis and appropriate clinical care of patients with chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: Health valuations are one way of measuring patient preferences with respect to the results of their treatment. The study examines three different methods of health valuations--willingness to pay (WTP), visual analogue scale (VAS), and a rating question for evaluating the subjective significance. The goal is to test the understandability and acceptance of these methods for implementation in questionnaires. METHOD: In various rehabilitation centres, a total of six focus groups were conducted with 5-9 patients each with a mean age of 57.1 years. The illnesses considered were chronic-ischaemic heart disease, chronic back pain, and breast cancer. Patients filled out a questionnaire that was then discussed in the group. In addition to the quantitative evaluation of the data in the questionnaire, a qualitative analysis of the contents of the group discussion protocols was made. RESULTS: We have results from a total of 42 patients. 14.6% of the patients had "great difficulties" understanding the WTP or rated it as "completely incomprehensible"; this value was 7.3% for VAS and 0% for the rating scale. With respect to acceptance, 31.0% of the patients indicated that they were "not really" or "not at all" willing to answer such a WTP question in a questionnaire; this was 6.6% for the VAS, and again 0% for the rating scale. The qualitative analysis provided an indication as to why some patients view the WTP question in particular in a negative light. Many difficulties in understanding it were related to the formulation of the question and the structure of the questionnaire. However, the patients' statements also made it apparent that the hypothetical nature of the WTP questionnaire was not always recognised. The most frequent reason for the lack of acceptance of the WTP was the patients' fear of negative financial consequences of their responses. DISCUSSION: With respect to understandability and acceptance, VAS questions appear to be better suited for reflecting patient preferences than WTP questions. The rating scale for assessing the personally estimated importance was understandable, but had poor distribution properties and was considered by patients to be superfluous.

AB  - CONTEXT: Patients suffering from chronic low back pain (cLBP) are often unsatisfied with conventional medical care and seek alternative therapies. Many mind-body techniques are said to help patients with low back pain by enhancing body awareness, which includes proprioception deficit in cLBP, but have not been rigorously studied in cLBP. Breath therapy is a western mind-body therapy integrating body awareness, breathing, meditation, and movement. Preliminary data suggest benefits from breath therapy for proprioception and low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of breath therapy on cLBP. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six patients with cLBP. INTERVENTIONS: Six to eight weeks (12 sessions) of breath therapy versus physical therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain by visual analog scale (VAS), function by Roland Scale, overall health by Short Form 36 (SF-36) at baseline, six to eight weeks, and six months. Balance as a potential surrogate for proprioception and body-awareness measured at the beginning and end of treatment. RESULTS: Pre- to post-intervention, patients in both groups improved in pain (VAS: -2.7 with breath therapy, -2.4 with physical therapy; SF-36: +14.9 with breath therapy and +21.0 with physical therapy). Breath therapy recipients improved in function (Roland: -4.8) and in the physical and emotional role (SF-36: +15.5 and 14.3). Physical therapy recipients improved in vitality (SF-36: +15.0). Average improvements were not different between groups. At six to eight weeks, results showed a trend favoring breath therapy; at six-months, a trend favoring physical therapy. Balance measures showed no improvements and no correlations with other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients suffering from cLBP improved significantly with breath therapy. Changes in standard low back pain measures of pain and disability were comparable to those resulting from high-quality, extended physical therapy. Breath therapy was safe. Qualitative data suggested improved coping skills and new insight into the effect of stress on the body as a result of breath therapy. Balance measures did not seem to be valid measures of clinical change in patients' cLBP.

AB  - PURPOSE: Many individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) report significant symptoms of depression and/or anxiety post-SCI; however, access to mental health services can be limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient perspectives on the acceptability of an 8-week guided Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) course (Chronic Conditions Course) for people with SCI. In particular, we sought to understand patient perceptions of facilitators and barriers of engaging in ICBT and strengths and weaknesses of ICBT program content. METHOD: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 8 SCI patients after completion of the ICBT course. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and examined by means of thematic analysis by 2 coders. RESULTS: Eight participants (mean age = 53.2 years; males = 50%; paraplegia = 67.5%) were interviewed. Four major themes emerged when examining facilitators to completing the program: accessibility, flexibility, motivation, and guided support. Barriers to completing the program included course timeframe and physical health. Strengths of the course included effective skill development and mental health prioritization. Suggested changes to the course included improved breadth of case stories, development of extra resources, adjusting the course timeframe to account for the SCI, and more support from the guide. CONCLUSIONS: ICBT was overall highlighted as an acceptable method of receiving care for people with SCI. The study provides direction for improving delivery of ICBT to ensure this method of treatment meets the needs of individuals with SCI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

To better understand the impact of chronic or recurrent pain on children within the context of their own lives and experiences, using qualitative analysis, and to suggest the applications of the narrative method to clinical practice.\n\nDesign. Grounded theory and narrative analysis of in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted at baseline and 6–12 months following clinic intake.\n\nSetting. Subject homes.\n\nPatients. Fifty-three children ages 10–17 presenting with recurrent pain to a university-based pain clinic. This sample did not differ significantly from the overall clinic population during the study period.\n\nResults. Five common themes were identified; these suggested that isolation, changed self-perception, activity limitations, concerns about barriers to future goals, and lack of medical validation were important to the children\u0027s perceived impact of pain on their lives. Five narratives were identified, each of which provided a coherent, integrated description of the factors and perspectives presented by a specific subset of children at baseline. These narratives were then compared against the children\u0027s reports of improvement in pain and functioning at 6–12 months; from this comparison, a sixth narrative of therapeutic change emerged for some of the children.\n\nConclusions. The authors suggest that physicians and parents who take the initiative to elicit the child\u0027s narrative can help the child to rewrite the story to promote therapeutic change, a better outcome, and higher satisfaction.

AB  - Conservative treatment for chronic low back pain was given to 151 men aged 54-63 years. Pretreatment back trouble and progress were assessed by subjective ratings in questionnaires before the treatment and at 2-, 6- and 12-month follow-up examinations. Physical measurements were made before the treatment and at the 2-month follow-up. Pretreatment low back trouble correlated significantly and positively with lumbar disc degeneration and negatively with spinal lateral flexion and rotation, hip flexion and extension, capacity for dynamic exercises, trunk isometric extension and flexion strength, and intraindividual trunk extension/flexion strength ratio. Progress was significantly associated with follow-up increases of spinal lateral flexion and rotation, hip flexion and lateral rotation, and trunk extension and flexion strength. Combinations of variables did not substantially improve their correlative power as indicators of low back trouble and progress.

AB  - Background: There is little evidence on differences across health care systems in choice and outcome of the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) with spinal surgery and conservative treatment as the main options. At least six randomised controlled trials comparing these two options have been performed; they show conflicting results without clear-cut evidence for superior effectiveness of any of the evaluated interventions and could not address whether treatment effect varied across patient subgroups. Cost-utility analyses display inconsistent results when comparing surgical and conservative treatment of CLBP. Due to its higher feasibility, we chose to conduct a prospective observational cohort study.Methods: This study aims to examine if1. Differences across health care systems result in different treatment outcomes of surgical and conservative treatment of CLBP2. Patient characteristics (work-related, psychological factors, etc.) and co-interventions (physiotherapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, return-to-work programs, etc.) modify the outcome of treatment for CLBP3. Cost-utility in terms of quality-adjusted life years differs between surgical and conservative treatment of CLBP. This study will recruit 1000 patients from orthopaedic spine units, rehabilitation centres, and pain clinics in Switzerland and New Zealand. Effectiveness will be measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at baseline and after six months. The change in ODI will be the primary endpoint of this study. Multiple linear regression models will be used, with the change in ODI from baseline to six months as the dependent variable and the type of health care system, type of treatment, patient characteristics, and co-interventions as independent variables. Interactions will be incorporated between type of treatment and different co-interventions and patient characteristics. Cost-utility will be measured with an index based on EQol-5D in combination with cost data.Conclusion: This study will provide evidence if differences across health care systems in the outcome of treatment of CLBP exist. It will classify patients with CLBP into different clinical subgroups and help to identify specific target groups who might benefit from specific surgical or conservative interventions. Furthermore, cost-utility differences will be identified for different groups of patients with CLBP. Main results of this study should be replicated in future studies on CLBP.

AB  - This paper begins with general discussion of chronic pain, in which the complex nature of this symptom is pointed out and the incorrect application of the widespread distinction between 'organic' and 'psychogenic' pain is criticized. A different classification which has proved clinically valuable is then briefly discussed. Subsequently, there is a discussion of the symptom of low back pain, a frequent disorder as demonstrated by the epidemiologic investigation reported. Then, reference is made to chronic low back pain which is often treated by surgical intervention such as operation for prolapsed intervertebral disc (PID). To conclude, a detailed report is presented of a study of 55 patients all of whom had been subjected at least once to a PID operation without success and who subsequently applied for partial percutaneous rhizotomy (PPR). Every patient was interviewed in depth and the results of these interviews are presented, classified by the main topics discussed. In addition, 6 months after PPR, a follow-up interview was conducted concerning the therapeutic results in the 31 patients who underwent this procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain places an enormous burden on health care systems. Multidisciplinary pain management services are well documented as an effective means to improve patient outcomes. However, waiting lists to access these services are long and outcomes deteriorate. Innovative solutions such as social media are gaining attention as a way to decrease this burden and improve outcomes. It is a challenge to design research that demonstrates whether social media are acceptable to patients and clinically effective. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a longitudinal pilot study to understand what aspects of research design are key to the success of running a larger-scale study of social media use in the clinical management of chronic pain. METHODS: A 12-week study examined social media use by patients on the waiting list for the Royal Melbourne Hospital Pain Management Service. Selected social media resources were suggested for use by patients waiting for an appointment at the clinic. Patients filled out measures for pain interference and pain self-efficacy before and after the study. Follow-up was conducted at monthly intervals via telephone semistructured interviews to discuss engagement and garner individual perceptions towards social media use. A social media-use instrument was also administered as part of the after-study questionnaire. RESULTS: Targeted recruitment refined 235 patient referrals to 138 (58.7%) suitable potential participants. Contact was made with 84 out of 138 (60.9%) patients. After a further exclusion of 54 out of 84 (64%) patients for various reasons, this left 30 out of 84 (36%) patients fitting the inclusion criteria and interested in study participation. A final study cohort of 17 out of 30 (57%) was obtained. Demographics of the 17 patients were mixed. Low back pain was the primary condition reported as leading to chronic pain. Semistructured interviews collected data from 16 out of 17 (94%) patients who started the trial, and at final follow-up 9 out of 17 (53%) patients completed questionnaires. Low specificity of the resources to one's condition and time poorness may have been barriers to engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that with refinements, this study design can be implemented successfully when conducting a larger social media study. At present, comment cannot be made on what effect using social media can have on patients on hospital waiting lists, nor whether those who use social media while waiting in pain achieve better outcomes from eventual participation in a chronic pain program. Long-term follow-up should be included in future studies to answer this. Future research should focus on multicenter randomized controlled trials, involving patients in the intervention design for improved participation and outcomes and for evidence to be sound.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate worldwide prevalence of chronic low back pain according to age and sex. METHODS: We consulted Medline (PubMed), LILACS and EMBASE electronic databases. The search strategy used the following descriptors and combinations: back pain, prevalence, musculoskeletal diseases, chronic musculoskeletal pain, rheumatic, low back pain, musculoskeletal disorders and chronic low back pain. We selected cross-sectional population-based or cohort studies that assessed chronic low back pain as an outcome. We also assessed the quality of the selected studies as well as the chronic low back pain prevalence according to age and sex. RESULTS: The review included 28 studies. Based on our qualitative evaluation, around one third of the studies had low scores, mainly due to high non-response rates. Chronic low back pain prevalence was 4.2% in individuals aged between 24 and 39 years old and 19.6% in those aged between 20 and 59. Of nine studies with individuals aged 18 and above, six reported chronic low back pain between 3.9% and 10.2% and three, prevalence between 13.1% and 20.3%. In the Brazilian older population, chronic low back pain prevalence was 25.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic low back pain prevalence increases linearly from the third decade of life on, until the 60 years of age, being more prevalent in women. Methodological approaches aiming to reduce high heterogeneity in case definitions of chronic low back pain are essential to consistency and comparative analysis between studies. A standard chronic low back pain definition should include the precise description of the anatomical area, pain duration and limitation level.

AB  - Schools have begun to use mindfulness training as one strategy for improving students’ academic achievement and social-emotional functioning. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effects of a brief mindfulness intervention on classroom climate and academic outcomes (i.e., reading fluency). Seven elementary school classrooms participated in a 10-week mindfulness intervention and were matched with seven control classrooms. Teachers were trained to implement a 2-min mindfulness-based intervention delivered three times per day. Results from this quasi-experimental study indicated an increase in classroom satisfaction among students participating in the intervention. Students in both control and intervention classes demonstrated increases in friction and decreases in cohesion. Improvements in students’ reading fluency were also observed. Teachers in the intervention group reported higher levels of classroom cohesion following the intervention. Both intervention and control group teachers reported changes in classroom climate over time, specifically indicating decreases in friction. Results from this exploratory study illustrate the varied implications and practicality of a brief mindfulness-based intervention in the classroom setting. Improvements in classroom satisfaction were evident for students; decreases in classroom cohesion and increases in friction emerged for both intervention and control groups. Further, discrepancies between teacher and student perceptions of class climate were also determined. These findings suggest that additional factors may be influencing classroom climate. Study limitations and avenues for future research are discussed.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the workplace information collected and shared between professionals of the centers and occupational health professionals during functional restoration programs intended to chronic low back pain patients. A descriptive study carried out by a questionnaire sent to the French rehabilitation centers offering a functional restoration program. Data collection focused on the kinds of professionals involved in programs, professionals who approach work issues, work analysis, social and occupational information collected, existence of a specific work rehabilitation program, frequency of and methods for sharing information with occupational health professionals. Occupational information was mostly collected at inclusion during an individual interview by the rehabilitation physicians, social workers, and occupational therapists. Workplace environment was the most poorly discussed aspect. A minority of centers adapted their programs regarding these information. Information sharing with occupational physicians was mostly through the patient and was influenced by the presence of an ergonomist or of an occupational physician in the team. The study found poor interest about work environment and that the cooperation between practitioners in disability management remains limited. The various practitioners’ cultures and interests may be a brake on cooperation and exchange of information.

AB  - Background: Chronic or recurrent musculoskeletal pain in the cervical and shoulder region is a common secondary problem after spinal cord injury (SCI), reported by 30% to 70% of individuals. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback training, in addition to a standard exercise program, on reducing shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users with SCI. Methods: Fifteen individuals with SCI, C6 or lower, who were manual wheelchair users with shoulder pain were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 interventions. The Exercise group (n = 7) received instruction on a standard home-based exercise program. The EMG Biofeedback plus Exercise group (n = 8) received identical exercise instruction plus EMG biofeedback training to improve muscle balance and muscle relaxation during wheelchair propulsion. Shoulder pain was assessed by the Wheelchair Users Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI) at baseline, at posttest 10 weeks after the start of intervention, and at follow-up 16 weeks after posttest. Results: The number of participants per group allowed only within-group comparisons; however, the findings indicated a beneficial effect from EMG biofeedback training. Shoulder pain, as measured by WUSPI, decreased 64% from baseline to posttest for the EMG Biofeedback plus Exercise group (P = .02). Shoulder pain for the Exercise group decreased a nonsignificant 27%. At follow-up, both groups showed continued improvement, yet the benefit of EMG biofeedback training was still discernible. The EMG Biofeedback plus Exercise group had an 82% reduction in shoulder pain from baseline to follow-up (P = .004), while the Exercise group showed a 63% reduction (P = .03) over the same time period. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that EMG biofeedback has value when added to an exercise intervention to reduce shoulder pain in manual wheelchair users with SCI. These findings indicate that EMG biofeedback may be valuable in remediating musculoskeletal pain as a secondary condition in SCI. This preliminary conclusion will need to be studied and verified through future work.

AB  - Background Context: Back pain is a highly prevalent health problem in the world today and has a great economic impact on health-care budgets. Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration has been identified as a main cause of back pain. Inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages or disc cells in an inflammatory environment play an important role in painful progressive degeneration of IVD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown to have immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. Mesenchymal stem cells express a variety of chemokines and cytokines receptors having tropism to inflammation sites.Purpose: This study aimed to develop an in vitro controlled and standardized model of inflammation and degeneration of IVD with rat cells and to evaluate the protective and immunomodulatory effect of conditioned medium (CM) from the culture of MSCs to improve the conditions presented in herniated disc and discogenic pain processes.Study Design: This is an experimental study.Methods: In this study, an in vitro model of inflammation and degeneration of IVD has been developed, as well as the effectiveness of CM from the culture of MSCs.Results: Conditioned medium from MSCs downregulated the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines produced in the pathogenesis of discogenic pain such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).Conclusion: Mesenchymal stem cells represent a promising alternative strategy in the treatment of IVD degeneration inasmuch as there is currently no treatment which leads to a complete remission of long-term pain in the absence of drugs.

AB  - Chronic pain sufferers with vertebral osteochondrosis (altogether 80 patients) have been examined. The course of the pain syndrome and its intensity were studied with a modified McGill's pain questionnaire. The latter proved able to provide a reliable reflection of the pain qualitative and quantitative characteristics allowing objective evaluation of pelotherapeutic analgetic potential. A course of pelotherapy resulted in pain relief and improved values of its basic components under study. Introduction of the analgetic coefficient promoted gradation of pelotherapy-induced analgetic effect.

AB  - Patients with chronic pain are often undertreated with medications alone and need alternative ways of coping. Identifying pain coping skills patients use may be beneficial; however, no research has investigated whether patients are aware of their coping skills. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients are aware of their pain coping skills, whether certain patient characteristics were related to using coping strategies, and whether coping strategies were related to psychiatric symptoms. Chart reviews were conducted on seventy-eight chronic pain patients who completed a semi-structured psychological interview. Patients endorsed using more coping strategies on the measure compared to the verbal self-report. Identifying with certain patient demographics was related to higher use of some coping strategies. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were also related to the use of some coping strategies. Anxiety was negatively related to ignoring the pain and using self-talk coping statements and positively related to catastrophizing. Depression was negatively related to the use of distraction, ignoring the pain, and using self-talk coping statements. Depression and pain severity were both positively related to catastrophizing and prayer. Results suggest that clinicians may need to help patients become aware of adaptive coping strategies they already use and that the use of certain coping strategies is related to lower levels of depression and anxiety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is highly prevalent and a significant public health burden in Western society. Feasibility studies suggest personalised pedometer-driven walking is an acceptable and effective motivating tool in the management of chronic low back pain (CLBP >= 12 weeks). The proposed study will investigate pedometer-driven walking as a low cost, easily accessible, and sustainable means of physical activity to improve disability and clinical outcomes for people with CLBP in Saskatchewan, Canada. METHODS/DESIGN: A fully-powered single-blinded randomised controlled trial will compare back care advice and education with back care advice and education followed by a 12-week pedometer-driven walking programme in adults with CLBP. Adults with self-reported CLBP will be recruited from the community and screened for elibility. Two-hundred participants will be randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups. All participants will receive a single back care advice and education session with a physiotherapist. Participants in the walking group will also receive a physiotherapist-facilitated pedometer based walking programme. The physiotherapist will facilitate the participant to monitor and progress the walking programme, by phone, on a weekly basis over 10 weeks following two face-to-face sessions. Outcome measures of self-reported disability, physical activity, participants' low back pain beliefs/perceptions, quality of life and direct/indirect cost estimates will be gathered at baseline, three months, six months, and 12 months by a different physiotherapist blinded to group allocation. Following intervention, focus groups will be used to explore participants' thoughts and experiences of pedometer-driven walking as a management tool for CLBP. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the design of a community-based RCT to determine the effectiveness of a pedometer-driven walking programme in the management of CLBP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: United States National Institutes of Health Clinical Trails registry (http://ClinicalTrials.gov/) No. NCT02284958 . Registered on 27(th) October 2014).

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review brings together developments over the past year in pain research using qualitative methodologies. In line with the goals of the current biopsychosocial model of pain, such a research framework offers in-depth understanding of the experience of pain within its cultural, familial and socioeconomic environmental context. RECENT FINDINGS: Using 'qualitative' and 'pain' as title and keyword Medline and CSA database searches, the pain literature revealed four main areas where qualitative studies have contributed significantly to knowledge development. These are: general chronic pain care: perspectives of patients and practitioners; pain experience across the lifespan; psychosocial aspects of back pain; and experience of underresearched conditions. SUMMARY: The detailed insight into subjective experiences of the pain sufferer or healthcare provider offered by qualitative research can make important contributions to evaluating and improving practice and also in theory development.

AB  - BACKGROUND We emphasize the utility of focusing on patient medical history and concerns rather than anchoring on data sent from referral institutions, which is often qualitative and devoid of useful patient-driven information. CASE REPORT A 21-year-old man was referred to our hospital with persistent back pain, hypoalbuminemia, and C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation after prolonged hospitalization for a UTI at another hospital. A review of systems (ROS) revealed chronic diarrhea and colonoscopy revealed Crohn's disease. Colonoscopy was followed by worsening back pain. Intestinal perforation was ruled out by X-ray, and analgesics were prescribed for long-standing scoliosis. The patient returned several days later with a recurrent UTI; a vesicointestinal fistula was identified, a known complication of Crohn's disease. This case involved diagnostic errors due to the doctors' faulty cognitive process. Also, in retrospect, we needed to be aware that the CT at the time of referral showed free air in the bladder and not uncomplicated pyelonephritis. The diagnostic errors were related to both satisfaction bias (finding one disease that prevents the accurate and timely diagnosis of another) and lack of awareness of epidemiology. To prevent errors like these, it is important to first conduct a careful interview and physical examination, as if the patient were a first-time patient, in order to eliminate the influence of bias. Next, epidemiological possibilities should be considered and differentiation made between physical and epidemiological issues. CONCLUSIONS It is important to treat referral patients as if they were first-time patients and to give due consideration to diagnostic biases and epidemiology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a pre-assessment can be used to establish whether cost-effectiveness results would meet the actual information needs of Dutch healthcare decision makers. METHODS: Two recent studies in rehabilitation medicine served as study material. Based on Wholey, a limited pre-assessment was performed in which the potential impact of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) results on intended users' decision making was assessed. Desk research and semi-structured interviews with several intended users of CEA results were performed. These included general practitioners, representatives of health insurance companies, the Health Care Insurance Board (CvZ), and medical guidelines committees. RESULTS: In day-to-day decision making of the interviewed decision makers, a cost-effectiveness criterion seemed to be of limited importance. Instead, results from clinical effectiveness studies and budget impact studies appeared to be sufficient. CvZ, however, preferred relative cost-effectiveness to be a criterion for inclusion in future reimbursement guidelines. In both cases the limited pre-assessments changed the expectations of the investigators regarding decision-making impact of an economic evaluation. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that the use of CEA results for Dutch micro- and meso-level healthcare decision making is not self-evident. The main purpose of CEA results is to support health policy making and planning at a macroeconomic level. Pre-assessment can be a valuable tool in designing a CEA to support the actual information needs of the decision makers.

AB  - Objective To determine the prevalence and severity of foot pain and deformity and the associated risk of leg and low back pain. Method A cross-sectional postal survey was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 2100 adult Danish inhabitants (18-80 years of age). Participants reported 1-month period prevalences of foot, lower leg, knee, hip and back pain. Results Responder rate was 79.6%. Prevalence of foot pain was 30.4% with a total of 55.9% reporting pain in the foot, leg or back lasting more than 1 day within the previous month. Foot pain lasting more than 1 month was experienced by 16.2% and 11.9% had pain lasting more than 1 year. The prevalence of self-reported pes planus or pes cavus was 17.9%. There was a significant association between foot pain and pain elsewhere in the leg and low back. Self-reported foot deformity was significantly associated with foot pain. Women had a significantly higher prevalence of foot pain and Body Mass Index was associated with foot pain in women but not in men. Conclusions Foot pain is highly prevalent and associated with foot deformity and leg and low back pain. More attention should be focused on foot pain and foot deformity. It is suggested that clinical examination of leg and low back pain should include foot examination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the nationwide German Acupuncture Trials (GERAC), verum acupuncture, mirroring the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture style, was tested against sham acupuncture and guideline standard therapy for the entities classified in the West as chronic low back pain (LBP) and gonarthrosis (GON). OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop broadly consensual acupuncture and control protocols for the treatment of LBP and GON in the GERAC trials. METHODOLOGY: Extensive literature study and consultation with acupuncture experts were consulted. Personal interviews, both free and structured, e-mail discussions, and phone conferences were used as well. RESULTS: Broadly consensual acupuncture protocols for LBP and GON for verum and invasive sham acupuncture were developed. They included semistandardized point combinations with clearly described point selection rules based on TCM acupuncture diagnosis. A procedure was developed to help ensure homogenous treatment quality in a large multicenter trial. CONCLUSIONS: With 1162 randomized patients for LBP and 1039 patients for GON, the GERAC study design allowed acupuncture to be tested in a naturalistic environment. The rigorous study design and large number of physician investigators guaranteed a high external validity for the results. The results will help determine the significance of Chinese acupuncture in the context of Western medicine for the treatment of LBP and GON.

AB  - An estimated 20 % of the global population experiences chronic pain, and comorbidity with emotional disorders such as depression is high. While the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) as an intervention for recurrent depression is escalating in both popularity and evidence-based success, MBCT is being increasingly utilised in a range of areas including chronic pain management. The current study was designed to conceptualise chronic pain patients’ perceived benefits of an MBCT programme. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 chronic pain patients who had participated in MBCT group training within a public hospital pain unit between 8 and 50 months previously. The recorded interviews were transcribed and interpreted using thematic analysis to identify key themes in participants’ comments. Four overarching themes were extracted: patients’ belief in the programme, patients’ perception of control, patients’ struggles and patients’ acceptance of the presence of pain. Participants who perceived benefits from the MBCT programme were most motivated to continue mindfulness practice. Identifying patients’ perspectives on their pain and the benefits of ongoing mindfulness practice following participation in an MBCT group intervention provided opportunity to discuss ways to best assist patients in developing and consolidating their practice. Clinical and research implications are discussed.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of PainReApp, an mHealth system, based on physical exercise recommendations for patients with chronic pain (low back pain, fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathic pain) based on pain intensity, quality of life, anxiety and/or depression, and sleep quality. Design: Single‐blinded randomized controlled trial. Methods: One hundred patients from three different chronic conditions (low back pain, fibromyalgia and neuropathic diabetic pain) will be recruited and randomized into two groups to receive the intervention with a physical activity program guided by the PainReApp system (experimental group) or with the program information in paper format (control group). All patients will attend a first face‐to‐face session in which the smartphone application usage (experimental group) and exercise execution will be explained (both groups). Data will be collected at baseline, 4, 12 and 24 weeks. Nevertheless, the users of the application will have a daily registry of the exercise performed and the self‐perceived difficulty. The primary outcomes of the trial will be the intensity of pain and quality of life. Anxiety and/or depression and sleep quality will be also assessed to evaluate the influence of the physical activity at multiple levels. Discussion: Physical exercise is becoming one of the leading evidence‐based interventions to treat chronic pain. It needs to be adapted to the necessities of each pain condition. One of the major problems is the low adherence to the proposed program. New strategies that empower the patients, such as the m‐Health, are reliable and useful tools to ease this end. Impact: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first long‐term randomized controlled trial researching the impact of an m‐health system on chronic pain from different origin. The intervention is based on international physical exercise recommendations and can be performed without specific material, allowing the home‐based practice. Trial registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12621000783820).

AB  - Objective: to implement the Nursing Process, based on the classification systems, to an individual with a herniated disc, based on the Person-to-Person Relationship Model of the theoretical Joyce Travelbee. Method: this is a qualitative, descriptive, case-control study. Data were collected with an individual, through a clinical interview and physical examination, following a guideline for the construction of the clinical case. The data analysis was based on the Nursing theory cited and the results are presented in figure form. Results: it is revealed that the diagnoses, results and interventions followed the Nursing classification systems, being the chronic pain and the low situational self-esteem the main diagnoses worked. Through the Travelbee model, it was possible to look beyond physical and biological needs. Conclusion: critical thinking and clinical reasoning, based theoretically as important instruments and parts of the Nursing process for decision making, are pointed out.

AB  - Objectives. Determine the impact of an 8-week mindfulness meditation program on disability, psychological function, and pain severity in community-dwelling older adults with chronic low back pain, and to test the education control program for feasibility.\n\nDesign. Randomized controlled trial.\n\nParticipants. Forty community-dwelling older adults with moderate low back pain or greater for at least the previous 3 months.\n\nIntervention. Participants were randomized to an 8-week meditation program or an 8-week education control program.\n\nOutcome Measures. Disability, psychological function, and pain severity were assessed. The same measures were obtained for both groups at baseline, at the end of the program, and 4 months after program completion.\n\nResults. Sixteen participants (80%) completed the meditation program and 19 (95%) completed the education program. Both the meditation and control group improved on measures of disability, pain, and psychological function, both at program completion and 4-month follow-up. The differences between the two groups did not reach statistical significance. The meditation group practiced mindfulness meditation a mean of 5 days/week (range 1–7) and mean of 31 minutes/session (range 22–48). At 4 months follow-up 14/16 (88%) participants continued to meditate.\n\nConclusion. Both the intervention group and the education control group improved on outcome measures suggesting both programs had a beneficial effect. Participants continued to meditate on 4-month follow-up. The control program was feasible but not inert. Piloting the control program in mind–body research can inform the design of larger clinical trials.

AB  - Importance  Treatment of chronic low back pain (LBP) in older adults is limited by the adverse effects of analgesics. Effective nonpharmacologic treatment options are needed.  Objective  To determine the effectiveness of a mind-body program at increasing function and reducing pain in older adults with chronic LBP.  Design, Setting, and Participants  This single-blind, randomized clinical trial compared a mind-body program (n = 140) with a health education program (n = 142). Community-dwelling older adults residing within the Pittsburgh metropolitan area were recruited from February 14, 2011, to June 30, 2014, with 6-month follow-up completed by April 9, 2015. Eligible participants were 65 years or older with functional limitations owing to their chronic LBP (≥11 points on the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire) and chronic pain (duration ≥3 months) of moderate intensity. Data were analyzed from March 1 to July 1, 2015.  Interventions  The intervention and control groups received an 8-week group program followed by 6 monthly sessions. The intervention was modeled on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program; the control program, on the “10 Keys” to Healthy Aging.  Main Outcomes and Measures  Follow-up occurred at program completion and 6 months later. The score on the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire was the primary outcome and measured functional limitations owing to LBP. Pain (current, mean, and most severe in the past week) was measured with the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, pain self-efficacy, and mindfulness. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted.  Results  Of 1160 persons who underwent screening, 282 participants enrolled in the trial (95 men [33.7%] and 187 women [66.3%]; mean [SD] age,74.5 [6.6] years). The baseline mean (SD) Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire scores for the intervention and control groups were 15.6 (3.0) and 15.4 (3.0), respectively. Compared with the control group, intervention participants improved an additional −1.1 (mean, 12.1 vs 13.1) points at 8 weeks and −0.04 (mean, 12.2 vs 12.6) points at 6 months (effect sizes, −0.23 and −0.08, respectively) on the Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire. By 6 months, the intervention participants improved on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale current and most severe pain measures an additional −1.8 points (95% CI, −3.1 to −0.05 points; effect size, −0.33) and −1.0 points (95% CI, −2.1 to 0.2 points; effect size, −0.19), respectively. The changes in Numeric Pain Rating Scale mean pain measure after the intervention were not significant (−0.1 [95% CI, −1.1 to 1.0] at 8 weeks and −1.1 [95% CI, −2.2 to −0.01] at 6 months; effect size, −0.01 and −0.22, respectively).  Conclusions and Relevance  A mind-body program for chronic LBP improved short-term function and long-term current and most severe pain. The functional improvement was not sustained, suggesting that future development of the intervention could focus on durability.  Trial Registration  clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01405716

AB  - The current opioid crisis has spurred the need for nonpharmacological therapies for chronic low back pain. In a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine, we reported that in 282 older adults with chronic low back pain, an 8-week mind-body group program modeled on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) decreased long-term pain and increased short-term function. Barriers to uptake remain such as patient resistance to accepting the benefits of nonpharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain. They may fear the clinician does not believe their pain complaint because they are not being offered a pain pill. By not appreciating the value of the therapy in helping their chronic low back pain, the patient may not be compliant with recommendations. Resistance likely derives from lack of understanding how a mind-body approach like MBSR can help relieve the sensation of pain as well as help increase function. Clinicians can help break through this barrier by educating their patients about the different ways in which MBSR works to reduce pain and improve function. In this commentary, we will discuss how our findings can inform the discussion clinicians have with their patients regarding the ways MBSR can relieve back pain. Pain processing is complex and top-down regulation is not fully engaged when pain is treated with pharmacotherapy alone. We share that our study showed a clinically meaningful reduction in pain and improvement in function and discuss some of the possible underlying mechanisms of MBSR\u0027s effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most people with spinal cord injury will develop secondary complications with potentially devastating consequences. Self-management is a key prevention strategy for averting the development of secondary complications and their recurrence. Several studies have shown that self-management programs improve self-management behaviors and health outcomes in individuals living with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. Given the burgeoning health care costs related to secondary complications, we developed an alternative electronic health-based implementation to facilitate the development of self-management skills among people with spinal cord injury. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a self-management app in spinal cord injury populations. The primary outcome is attainment of self-selected, self-management goals. Secondary outcomes include increases in general and self-management self-efficacy and reductions in self-reported health events, health care utilization, and secondary complications related to spinal cord injury. This study also aims to explore how the intervention was implemented and how the app was experienced by end users. METHODS: This study will employ a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative portion of our study will involve a rater-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a stepped wedge design (ie, delayed intervention control group). The primary outcome is successful goal attainment, and secondary outcomes include increases in self-efficacy and reductions in self-reported health events, health care utilization, and secondary conditions related to spinal cord injury. The qualitative portion will consist of semistructured interviews with a subsample of the participants. RESULTS: We expect that the mobile self-management app will help people with spinal cord injury to attain their self-management goals, improve their self-efficacy, reduce secondary complications, and decrease health care utilization. CONCLUSIONS: If the results are positive, this study will produce credible new knowledge describing multiple outcomes that people with spinal cord injury realize from an app-based self-management intervention and support its implementation in clinical practice.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and effectiveness of an adapted 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program for elders in a continuing care community. This mixed-methods study used both quantitative and qualitative measures. A randomized waitlist control design was used for the quantitative aspect of the study. Thirty-nine elderly were randomized to MBSR (n = 20) or a waitlist control group (n = 19), mean age was 82 years. Both groups completed pre-post measures of health-related quality of life, acceptance and psychological flexibility, facets of mindfulness, self-compassion, and psychological distress. A subset of MBSR participants completed qualitative interviews. MBSR participants showed significantly greater improvement in acceptance and psychological flexibility and in role limitations due to physical health. In the qualitative interviews, MBSR participants reported increased awareness, less judgment, and greater self-compassion. Study results demonstrate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of an adapted MBSR program in promoting mind-body health for elders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the evidence from the literature regarding the effects of cupping therapy on chronic back pain in adults, the most used outcomes to evaluate this condition, the protocol used to apply the intervention and to investigate the effectiveness of cupping therapy on the intensity of chronic back pain. METHOD: systematic review and meta-analysis carried out by two independent researchers in national and international databases. Reference lists of systematic reviews were also explored. The quality of evidence was assessed according to the Jadad scale. RESULTS: 611 studies were identified, of which 16 were included in the qualitative analysis and 10 in the quantitative analysis. Cupping therapy has shown positive results on chronic back pain. There is no standardization in the treatment protocol. The main assessed outcomes were pain intensity, physical incapacity, quality of life and nociceptive threshold before the mechanical stimulus. There was a significant reduction in the pain intensity score through the use of cupping therapy (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: cupping therapy is a promising method for the treatment of chronic back pain in adults. There is the need to establish standardized application protocols for this intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Efforts undertaken during the return to work (RTW) process need to be sufficient to prevent unnecessary applications for disability benefits. The purpose of this study was to identify factors relevant to RTW Effort Sufficiency (RTW-ES) in cases of sick-listed employees with chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHODS: Using focus groups consisting of Labor Experts (LE's) working at the Dutch Social Insurance Institute, arguments and underlying grounds relevant to the assessment of RTW-ES were investigated. Factors were collected and categorized using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF model). RESULTS: Two focus groups yielded 19 factors, of which 12 are categorized in the ICF model under activities (e.g. functional capacity) and in the personal (e.g. age, tenure) and environmental domain (e.g. employer-employee relationship). The remaining 7 factors are categorized under intervention, job accommodation and measures. CONCLUSIONS: This focus group study shows that 19 factors may be relevant to RTW-ES in sick-listed employees with CLBP. Providing these results to professionals assessing RTW-ES might contribute to a more transparent and systematic approach. Considering the importance of the quality of the RTW process, optimizing the RTW-ES assessment is essential.

AB  - This study aimed to develop culturally sensitive pain neuroscience education (PNE) materials for Hausa speaking patients with chronic spinal pain (CSP). PNE is a program of teaching patients about pain that has gained considerable attention in research and is increasingly used during physical therapy for patients with chronic pain. It helps in decreasing pain, disability, fear-avoidance, pain catastrophization, movement restriction, and health care utilization among patients with chronic pain. However, existing PNE materials and their application are limited to few languages and cultural inclinations. Due to the variations in pain perceptions, beliefs, and related outcomes among different population groups, culture-sensitive PNE materials addressing these outcomes are warranted. A focus-group discussion comprising 4 experts was used to adapt and develop preliminary PNE materials. Thereafter, an internet-based 3-round modified Delphi-study involving 22 experts ensued. Experts' consensus/recommendations concerning the content were used in modifying the PNE materials. Consensus was predefined as >=75% level of (dis)agreement. Eighteen experts completed the Delphi rounds. Nineteen, 18 and 18 experts participated in rounds 1, 2 and 3 respectively, representing 86%, 94% and 100% participation rate respectively. Consensus agreement was reached in every round and content of the materials, including drawings, examples, figures and metaphors were adapted following the experts' suggestions. We therefore concluded that, culture-sensitive PNE materials for Hausa speaking patients with CSP were successfully produced. The present study also provides a direction for further research whereby the effects of culturally-sensitive PNE materials can be piloted among Hausa speaking patients with CSP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among non-communicable disorders, low back and neck pain are the most common causes of severe, long-term pain and disability affecting more than a billion people globally. Yet, the burden and impact of these conditions are not well understood, especially among rural and tribal people living in low- and middle-income countries. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to measure point prevalence of low back and neck pain among rural and tribal people in Raigad District of Maharashtra, India, and explore attitudes and beliefs of rural people towards spine pain and disability. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional survey of six villages in the Raigad District of Maharashtra State of India from August to October 2016, low back and neck pain were measured using the Spine Pain Questionnaire. RESULTS: We surveyed 2323 participants, which did not include children and adolescents. Among rural people (n = 2073), the point prevalence of low back and neck pain was 4.9% (95% CI 3.94-5.79) and 2.9% (95% CI 2.21-8.87), respectively. Among tribal people (n = 250), prevalence was 10.0% (95% CI 6.28-13.71) for low back pain and 3.6% (95% CI 1.29-5.90) for neck pain. Lifting heavy weights and bending trunk were the most limiting activities. During informal discussions, most villagers attributed spine pain to traditional lifestyle and age. Participants continued occupational work in the presence of pain. Lack of transport facilities and cost of treatment emerged as the two most common reasons for delay in seeking treatment at nearby healthcare centres. This information will inform the development of customized spine care programmes through community-engaged partnerships and self-empowerment of the local community.

AB  - Research has shown that taxi drivers are at risk for numerous health concerns, such as low back and leg pain, linked to their highly sedentary occupation, long work hours and stressors related to the job (e.g. low income, safety threats). The goal of this study was to explore occupational health risks and opportunities for health interventions with taxi drivers using community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods. A mixed methods approach included first a convenience sample of 19 East African taxi drivers participating in focus group discussions. Second, a convenience sample of 75 current taxi drivers (M age = 45.7 years) and 25 non-driver comparison participants (M age = 40.3 years) were recruited to complete a structured self-reported questionnaire and objective measures of health. Health education was provided alongside the research to address common health concerns and to ensure mutual benefit and an action orientation. The focus groups described numerous health concerns that drivers attributed to their occupation, including chronic pain, sleep deprivation, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease and eye problems, as the most common. Participants offered ideas for health interventions that include workplace reform and driver education. Quantitative data indicate that 44% of drivers reported their health as 'fair' or 'poor'. Drivers were more likely to report musculoskeletal pain, less sleep, more fatigue and less physical activity as compared to non-drivers. The majority of drivers reported financial and job dissatisfaction. The research provides data to inform targeted health interventions that support the health and safety of taxi drivers.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The main study objective was to identify challenges and barriers experienced by dermatologists and rheumatologists when engaging women of reproductive age in shared decision-making (SDM) related to treatment and management of chronic inflammatory disease (CID) before, during and after pregnancy. DESIGN: A mixed-methods study was conducted, employing (1) semistructured interviews, (2) an online survey and (3) triangulation of findings. PARTICIPANTS: 524 dermatologists and rheumatologists entered the study; 495 completed it; 388 met inclusion criteria for analysis. Participants were included if actively practising in Germany (GER), the UK or the USA; had a minimum 5% caseload of female patients of reproductive age with either axial spondyloarthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis; and had experience prescribing biologics. RESULTS: 48 interviews and 340 surveys were analysed. Interviews underscored dermatologists and rheumatologists' suboptimal integration of SDM in clinical practice. In the survey, 90% (n=305) did not know about SDM models. A perceived lack of competency counselling patients on pregnancy and family planning was also identified during interviews. Among the survey sample, 44% (n=150) of specialists agreed they preferred leaving pregnancy-related discussions to obstetricians and/or gynaecologists and 57% (n=189) reported having suboptimal skills discussing contraceptive methods with patients. Another finding that emerged from interviews was the perception that all biologics are strictly contraindicated during pregnancy. Suboptimal knowledge was noted among 57% (n=95) of dermatologists and 48% (n=83) of rheumatologists surveyed in that regard, with a statistically significant difference by country among dermatologists (GER: 42% vs UK: 71% vs USA: 57%, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified low levels of knowledge, skill and confidence, as well as attitudinal issues, that explain why SDM is not fully integrated in dermatology and rheumatology clinical practice. Blended-learning interventions are recommended to assist CID specialists in developing effective communication and patient engagement competencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic low back pain (LBP) is a major public health problem in industrialized countries and is one of the most common reasons for seeking healthcare. Although the McKenzie therapy is widely used for the treatment of low back pain, there is evidence for no improvement with exercise in short-, intermediate-, or long-term outcomes of pain relief or function. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the McKenzie therapy with electrophysical agents (EPAs) in patients with chronic LBP.MATERIAL AND METHOD: A randomized controlled comparative trial with a 3-month follow-up period was conducted between January 2009 and June 2012. 271 patients with chronic LBP, (more than three months duration of symptoms) were randomized into two groups: the McKenzie therapy group (n=134), and electrophysical agents group, (n=137). The treatment period of both groups was 4 weeks at an outpatient clinic. Clinical outcomes (pain intensity, trunk flexion range of motion, and disability) were obtained at follow-up appointments at the end of the treatment period, 2 and 3 months.RESULTS: Significant improvement of spinal motion, reduction of pain and disability were demonstrated in both groups but the results show the greater improvement in the McKenzie group (p< 0.05). CONCLUSION: McKenzie therapy reduces pain, and disability, among subjects with chronic LBP. This study revealed that the McKenzie therapy is more effective than EPAs group.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Phenomenological, qualitative investigation. The discord between commonly used outcome measures and patients' self-perceived recovery is problematic in the investigation and rehabilitation of low-back pain-related disorders. To better understand the course and development of this costly and disabling condition, the complex process of patient recovery requires further elucidation. OBJECTIVE: To explore issues and experiences impacting retrospective, self-appraised recovery. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 32 purposively sampled individuals, after which computer-assisted substantive categorization and thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Self-appraised status could be determined as "recovered" for 17 respondents, "unsure" for 6, and "not recovered" for 9. Recovery/non-recovery hinged on continued pain-related issues and the perception that injury/trauma made recovery impossible. Individuals who had difficulties relating the recovery construct to their context as well as those who were sceptical of pain-free periods were unable to appraise their status. CONCLUSION: This investigation confirms that pain is central to the resolution of recurrent low-back pain associated disorders. However, recovery also involves "redefinition" and "readjustment". In the investigation and rehabilitation of ambiguous, regional musculoskeletal disorders, our results provide further sensitizing concepts, derived through naturalistic observation, that are useful in the development of a more comprehensive explanatory framework of patient recovery.

AB  - Objectives: Piriformis syndrome (PS) is often refractory to conventional therapies. Guided injection techniques generally necessitate a computed tomography or fluoroscopic guidance that may not be available in most pain management centers in addition to its relative high cost. The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate whether clonidine-bupivacaine nerve-stimulator guided injections are effective in achieving long-lasting pain relief in PS compared with bupivacaine guided injection. Methods: A pilot study conducted on 18 patients (15 females, 3 males) diagnosed with PS showed the adequacy of nerve stimulator guided technique assessed via confirmatory visualized tomography scan demonstrating a worthy coverage of the piriformis muscle in about 84% of the cases. This randomized double-blind trial included 80 patients with PS who received a nerve stimulator-guided piriformis injection (group C received 9 mL bupivacaine 0.5% and 1 mL clonidine 150 mcg/mL; group B received 9 mL bupivacaine 0.5% and 1 mL saline). Pain characteristics and analgesics consumption were the primary end points assessed for 6 months. Results: Group C showed significantly lower pain scores and analgesics consumption than group B (P<0.0001). Pain at 6 months was significantly greater in group B (78%) than in group C (8%) (P<0.01). For every 18 months of PS pain, the outcomes demonstrated that a patient needed 1 additional injection to the initial injection. Discussion: Repeated clonidine-guided piriformis injection relieved PS symptoms and reduce analgesic consumption for a 6-month period. It is a cost-effective useful treatment for PS refractory to traditional therapeutic approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive-affective factors influence the perception of pain and disability. These factors can lead to pain behaviors (PB) that can persist and become maladaptive. These maladaptive PB will further increase the risk of chronicity or persistence of symptoms and disability. Thus, clinicians must be prepared to recognize maladaptive PB in a clinical context. To date, in the context of assessment in a rehabilitation setting, PB in clinical settings are poorly documented. The main objective of this study was to identify direct observation methods and critically appraise them in order to propose recommendations for practice. As a secondary objective, we explored and extracted the different observable PB that patients could exhibit and that clinicians could observe. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive review on four databases with a generic search strategy in order to obtain the largest range of PB. For the first objective, a two-step critical appraisal used clinical criteria (from qualitative studies on barriers to implement routine measures) and psychometric criteria (from Brink and Louw critical appraisal tool) to determine which observation methods could be recommended for clinical practice. For the second objective, we extracted PB found in the literature to list potential PB that patients could exhibit, and clinicians could observe. RESULTS: From the 3362 retrieved studies, 47 met the inclusion criteria for the first objective. The clinical criteria allowed us to select three observation methods. After the psychometric step, two observation methods were retained and recommended for clinical practice: the Behavioral Avoidance Test-Back Pain (BAT-Back) and the Pain Behaviour Scale (PaBS). For the second objective, 107 studies met the inclusion criteria. The extraction of the PB allowed us to list a large range of PB and classify the data in 7 categories of PB. CONCLUSION: Our results allowed us to recommend two observation methods for clinical practice. However, these methods have limitations and are validated only in chronic low back pain populations. With the extraction of PB presented in the literature, we contribute to better prepare clinicians to recognize PB in all patients who are experiencing pain.

AB  - Back pain is one of the most common complaints in the general population and chronic back pain is a major Public Health burden. However, the prevalence of chronic back pain in Germany is not known. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of chronic back pain in the general adult population in Germany and to identify highly affected population groups. A nation-wide computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey was conducted with 8,318 men and women aged 18 years and older residing in German households. Participants were selected using the Gabler-Hader telephone sampling method and the next-birthday method. The one-year prevalence of chronic back pain defined as daily or almost daily back pain over a period of three months was 16 % in men and 22 % in women, the lifetime prevalence 24 % in men and 30 % in women. The 12-months prevalence of any back pain was 66 % in women and 58 % in men. Back pain on the day preceding the interview was reported by 18 % of men and 27 % of women and had a median intensity on a 1 - 10 point scale of 5 in women and 4 in men. Factors independently associated with chronic back pain in the past 12 months were age, female sex, a history of arthritis, self-reported depression, lower educational level, current unemployment, overweight or obesity, no sports, smoking and living with a partner. In conclusion, chronic back pain is a highly prevalent complaint in the general population in Germany. The association not only with bone and joint diseases but also with depression, a lower level of education and with certain lifestyle behaviours emphasises that back pain should not be viewed only in the context of the spine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is no gold standard for measuring adherence to prescribed home exercise. Self-report diaries are commonly used however lack of standardisation, inaccurate recall and self-presentation bias limit their validity. A valid and reliable tool to assess exercise adherence behaviour is required. Consequently, this article reports the development and psychometric evaluation of the Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS). DESIGN: Development of a questionnaire. SETTING: Secondary care in physiotherapy departments of three hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: A focus group consisting of 8 patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) and 2 physiotherapists was conducted to generate qualitative data. Following on from this, a convenience sample of 224 people with CLBP completed the initial 16-item EARS for purposes of subsequent validity and reliability analyses. METHODS: Construct validity was explored using exploratory factor analysis and item response theory. Test-retest reliability was assessed 3 weeks later in a sub-sample of patients. RESULTS: An item pool consisting of 6 items was found suitable for factor analysis. Examination of the scale structure of these 6 items revealed a one factor solution explaining a total of 71% of the variance in adherence to exercise. The six items formed a unidimensional scale that showed good measurement properties, including acceptable internal consistency and high test-retest reliability. CONCLUSIONS: The EARS enables the measurement of adherence to prescribed home exercise. This may facilitate the evaluation of interventions promoting self-management for both the prevention and treatment of chronic conditions.

AB  - We conducted a systematic search of qualitative research into the individual's experience of chronic low back pain. Two reviewers independently read through 740 unique abstracts. Inter-rater reliability was fair. The final sample comprised 19 articles which we critiqued using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. This article focuses on the critical appraisal. Limitations include a lack of an adequate rationale for the theoretical framework, a lack of an account for the decisions made across recruitment and data collection, and a lack of reflexivity. Finally we discuss and offer recommendations for reflexivity and the explication of qualitative methodology in research articles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Combined physical and psychological programmes (CPPP) are recommended for people with disabling low back pain (LBP). Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) is a physiotherapist-led low intensity CPPP with positive effects in previous studies. The clinical and cost effectiveness of CFT has not previously been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). Before a definitive RCT can be completed it is necessary to determine if completing such a study is possible. PURPOSE: To determine the feasibility of completing a definitive RCT, that will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of CFT in comparison to usual physiotherapy care for people with persistent LBP in the UK NHS. METHODS: A pragmatic two-arm parallel feasibility RCT comparing CFT with usual physiotherapy care for people with persistent LBP will be completed. Sixty participants will be randomly allocated to receive CFT or usual physiotherapy care. The primary outcome will be feasibility of completing a definitive RCT. Participant reported outcome measures will be recorded at baseline, three, six and twelve-month follow-up, including disability, pain intensity, quality of life and psychosocial function. Data will be analysed descriptively. A qualitative process evaluation will explore the acceptability of the research processes and interventions. DISCUSSION: The rationale and methodological design of a mixed methods feasibility RCT is presented. This study aims to inform the planning, design and completion of a future definitive RCT in the UK NHS. The results will be disseminated through peer reviewed open access journal publication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a complex condition, often recurring or chronic, which has proved difficult to characterise. To explore an alternative approach to assessing low back pain, an expert panel adapted the 'Miracle Question' from Solution-Focused Brief Therapy. This asks about a forward scenario of waking without the problems that the client had presented with. The question was adapted to: What would you do if you did not have back pain? OBJECTIVES: To explore the use of the Adapted Miracle Question (AMQ) within an interview study of patients with low back pain. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The AMQ was used in an interview study of 34 participants recruited from the UK Back Skills Training (BeST) trial, assessing the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural approach intervention for the management of low back pain. Responses to the AMQ were analysed thematically and then case by case. RESULTS: Interviewees talked about details of their activities and ability to function that would be different, and about change to their quality of life. Some talked about work. Five interviewees said that it would make no difference to them. When considered overall, the responses could be categorised as: no change; some change in activity/function; a return to their pre-back pain state; and life would be transformed. CONCLUSION: The AMQ was straightforward to ask and prompted a breadth of responses which may be useful in tailoring treatment. This question warrants further evaluation in the clinical setting.

AB  - Previous studies have found a high number of childhood adversities in patients with chronic low back pain, particularly in patients reporting persisting problems after back surgery. Our aim was to reproduce these results. Within the framework of a comprehensive diagnostic assessment and psychometric evaluation, 109 inpatients who had been treated for low back pain were examined in the orthopedics department of a German university hospital. Five risk factors investigated by Schofferman and his staff (Schofferman et al., 1993) were re-assessed in all of our patients using a structured biographical interview. The German chronic low back pain group was also compared with an age- and gender-matched control group of 109 non-chronic pain patients with respect to these childhood adversities and additional ones. Only approximately 11% of the German chronic low back pain sample demonstrated three or more risk factors, compared with more than 50% in Schofferman's sample, and 47.7% showed none of the five risk factors, compared to only 11% in the Schofferman sample. Moreover, no significant differences in distribution either in terms of the individual risk factors or their cumulative frequency were found in the German chronic low back pain group compared with an age and gender-matched control group without chronic pain. Childhood adversities do not occur frequently in a non-selected group of patients with chronic low back pain. Earlier results showing an increased likelihood of the occurrence of psychosocial risk factors could not be confirmed. As a consequence, further psychic or psychosomatic diagnostics of patients with chronic low back pain are needed to define diagnostic subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of cervical or lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain can only be made by using local anesthesia to block the nerves supplying the painful joint. There is a lack of effective treatment for chronic zygapophyseal joint pain or discogenic pain. Radiofrequency denervation appears to be an emerging technology, with substantial variation in its use between countries. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain disorders. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and EMBASE from start to February 2002, plus the Cochrane Library 2002, Issue 2. The references of identified articles were checked and three experts in the field of radiofrequency treatment were consulted to identify studies we might have missed. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of radiofrequency denervation for musculoskeletal pain disorders, with no language or date restrictions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers selected RCTs that met predefined inclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the main results and methodological quality of the selected trials, using standardized forms. Qualitative analysis was conducted to evaluate the level of scientific evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We found only nine articles, reporting on seven relevant RCTs. Six of the seven were considered to be high-quality. The selected trials included 275 randomized patients, 141 of whom received active treatment. One study examined cervical zygapophyseal joint pain, two cervicobrachial pain, three lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain, and one discogenic low-back pain. The study sample sizes were small, follow-up times short, and there were some deficiencies in patient selection, outcome assessments, and statistical analyses. The level of scientific evidence for the short-term effectiveness of radiofrequency denervation was limited for cervical zygapophyseal joint and cervicobrachial pain, and conflicting for lumbar zygapophyseal joint pain. There was limited evidence suggesting that intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation was not effective for discogenic low-back pain. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: The selected trials provide limited evidence that radiofrequency denervation offers short-term relief for chronic neck pain of zygapophyseal joint origin and for chronic cervicobrachial pain; conflicting evidence on the short-term effect of radiofrequency lesioning on pain and disability in chronic low-back pain of zygapophyseal joint origin; and limited evidence that intradiscal radiofrequency thermocoagulation is not effective for chronic discogenic low-back pain. There is a need for further high-quality RCTs with larger patient samples and data on long-term effects, for which current evidence is inconclusive. Furthermore, RCTs are needed in non-spinal indications where radiofrequency denervation is currently used without any scientific evidence. [References: 59]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP) experience changes in gait control due to pain and/or fear. Although CLBP patients' gait has been performed in laboratory environments, changes in gait control as an adaptation to unstructured daily living environments may be more pronounced than the corresponding changes in laboratory environments. We investigated the impacts of the environment and pathology on the trunk variability and stability of gait in CLBP patients. METHODS: CLBP patients (n=20) and healthy controls with no low-back pain history (n=20) were tasked with walking in a laboratory or daily-living environment while wearing an accelerometer on the low back. We calculated the stride-to-stride standard deviation and multiscale sample entropy as indices of "gait variability" and the maximum Lyapunov exponent as an index of "gait stability" in both the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. The participants were assessed on the numerical rating scale for pain intensity, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: In a repeated-measures ANOVA, the standard deviation was affected by environment in the anterior-posterior direction and by group and environment in the medial-lateral direction. Multiscale sample entropy showed no effect in the anterior-posterior direction and showed both effects in the medial-lateral direction. Maximum Lyapunov exponents showed both effects in the anterior-posterior direction, but none in the medial-lateral direction. These changes of trunk motor control by CLBP patients were found to be related to pain intensity, fear of movement, and/or QOL in the daily-living environment but not in the laboratory environment. CONCLUSION: These results revealed that CLBP patients exhibit changes in trunk variability and stability of gait depending on the environment, and they demonstrated that these changes are related to pain, fear, and QOL. We propose useful accelerometer-based assessments of qualitative gait in CLBP patients' daily lives, as it would provide information not available in a general practice setting.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this systematic literature review was to develop recommendations for the assessment of spine-related complaints in medically underserved areas with limited resources.Methods: We conducted a systematic review and best evidence synthesis of guidelines on the assessment of spine-related complaints. Independent reviewers critically appraised eligible guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II criteria. Low risk of bias clinical practice guidelines was used to develop recommendations. In accordance with the mandate of the Global Spinal Care Initiative (GSCI), recommendations were selected that could be applied to medically underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries by considering the limited access and costs of diagnostic technologies.Results: We screened 3069 citations; 20 guidelines were eligible for critical appraisal. We used 13 that had a low risk of bias that targeted neck and back pain.Conclusions: When assessing patients with spine-related complaints in medically underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries, we recommend that clinicians should: (1) take a clinical history to determine signs or symptoms suggesting serious pathology (red flags) and psychological factors (yellow flags); (2) perform a physical examination (musculoskeletal and neurological); (3) do not routinely obtain diagnostic imaging; (4) obtain diagnostic imaging and/or laboratory tests when serious pathologies are suspected, and/or presence of progressive neurologic deficits, and/or disabling persistent pain; (5) do not perform electromyography or nerve conduction studies for diagnosis of intervertebral disc disease with radiculopathy; and (6) do not perform discography for the assessment of spinal disorders. This information can be used to inform the GSCI care pathway and model of care. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the questions that community-dwelling individuals with a traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) have regarding their chronic pain and to identify their preferred methods of acquiring this information. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 individuals experiencing SCI-related chronic pain. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify participants' questions about their pain and to organise them according to emergent themes. RESULTS: Six themes pertaining to chronic pain were identified. These included: (1) cause, (2) communication, (3) expectation, (4) getting information, (5) management and (6) other's experience with chronic pain. Participants described using a variety of sources to obtain information about chronic pain including health care providers, other SCI-consumers and the Internet. Participants preferred to have chronic pain information available to them on an as needed basis. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with SCI have numerous questions about their chronic pain and use a variety of information sources to answer them. Many are dissatisfied with the level of knowledge that family physicians have about SCI-related chronic pain. This study provides valuable information from the consumer's perspective, which can be used to develop interventions to help health care professionals and consumers manage SCI-related chronic pain.

AB  - The main purpose of this article is to elucidate pain from a phenomenological perspective. New knowledge can be developed by investigating pain from the perspective of other peoples lived experience. The empirical basis of this research are men with severe and persistent phantom limb and spinal cord injury pain. All these men have developed their pain after injury caused by multi-traumatic accidents. The article starts with a brief look at the biomedical research on pain, both from a historical and contemporary perspective. It shows that in the biomedical perspective, pain is viewed as a subjective and multidimensional experience. The main focus of this article is to introduce phenomenological philosophy as a perspective that has a crucial relevance for understanding pain by its emphasis both on pain as an existential and embodied experience. Some preliminary empirical results from the study are that pain has a tendency to isolate the person. In some cases it even seems to threaten life itself, through its devastating impact on the person's self and body, thus destroying the person's will to live.Although the burden of pain seems excruciating in some of the cases, it also sometimes seems to be modulated by the will to exist and the persons hope for tolerable pain. The material reveals that many of these persons have a fundamental will to understand their pain although it often seems hard to comprehend pain from an absent or paralysed part of the body. The study also illuminates the challenge of health care workers who in the care of these patients are supposed to understand and relieve the person's pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity is a public health problem with high prevalence and important consequences. The aim of this paper was to verify the prevalence and distribution of multimorbidity in Brazilian older adults. METHODS: A population-based survey was carried out in 2008 through face-to-face interviews with 1593 older adults (aged 60 or over) living in Bage, a medium-sized city in Southern Brazil. Multimorbidity was evaluated by 17 morbidities and operationalized according to two cutoff points: 2 or more and 3 or more morbidities. Descriptive analysis examined the occurrence of multimorbidity by demographic, socioeconomic and health services variables. Observed and expected dyads and triads of diseases were calculated. RESULTS: From total sample, 6 % did not have morbidities. Mean morbidity was 3.6. Morbidities showing higher prevalence were high blood pressure - HBP - (55.3 %) and spinal column disease (37.4 %). The percent of participants with multimorbidity was 81.3 % (95 % CI: 79.3; 83.3) for 2 or more morbidities and 64.0 % (95 % CI: 61.5; 66.4) for 3 or more morbidities. In both measures occurrence was higher among women, the more elderly, less socioeconomic status, the bedridden, those who did not have a health private plan, those who used health services and those living in Family Health Strategy catchment areas. We found 22 dyads of morbidities with prevalence 10 % or more and 35 triads with prevalence 5 % or more. The most prevalent observed pair and triplet of morbidities were HBP and spinal column disease (23.6 %) and HBP, rheumatism/arthritis/arthrosis and spinal column disease (10.6 %), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity frequency was high in the sample studied, in keeping with percentage found in other countries. The social inequities identified increase the health system challenges for the management of multimorbidity, requiring a comprehensive and multidimensional care. The combinations of diseases can provide initial input to include multimorbidity in Brazilian clinical protocols.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In recent years, long-term prescribing and use of strong opioids for chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) has increased in high-income countries. Yet existing uncertainties, controversies, and differing recommendations make the rationale for prolonged opioid use in CNCP unclear. This systematic review and meta-analyses compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of strong opioids with placebo or nonopioid therapy in CNCP, with a special focus on chronic low back pain (CLBP). Systematic literature searches were performed in 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL) in July 2019 and updated by regular alerts until December 2020. We included 16 placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials for CLBP and 5 studies (2 randomized controlled trials and 3 nonrandomized studies) of opioids vs nonopioids for CNCP in the quantitative and qualitative synthesis. Random effects pairwise meta-analyses were performed for efficacy, safety, and tolerability outcomes and subgroup analyses for treatment duration, study design, and opioid experience status. Very low to low certainty findings suggest that 4 to 15 weeks (short or intermediate term) opioid therapy in CLBP (compared with placebo) may cause clinically relevant reductions in pain but also more gastrointestinal and nervous system adverse events, with likely no effect on disability. By contrast, long-term opioid therapy (>=6 months) in CNCP may not be superior to nonopioids in improving pain or disability or pain-related function but seems to be associated with more adverse events, opioid abuse or dependence, and possibly an increase in all-cause mortality. Our findings also underline the importance and need for well-designed trials assessing long-term efficacy and safety of opioids for CNCP and CLBP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low-back pain is a significant public health problem for which few therapies are supported by predictable outcomes. In this report, practice activities and 1-month outcomes data are presented for 93 chiropractic patients and 45 medical patients with chronic, recurrent low-back pain. DESIGN: A prospective, observational, community-based feasibility study involving chiropractors and family medicine physicians. SETTING: Forty private chiropractic clinics, the outpatient clinic of the Department of Family Medicine at Oregon Health Sciences University, and 5 other Portland area family medicine clinics. Outcomes Measures: The main outcome measures were pain severity, functional disability, sensory and affective pain quality at 1 month, and patient satisfaction assessed at 7 to 10 days and at 1 month. RESULTS: Although differences were noted in age, sex, education, and employment, the patients were closely matched at baseline with respect to frequency, severity, and type of low-back pain and the psychosocial dimensions of general health. The treatment of choice for chiropractors was spinal manipulation and physical therapy modalities; for medical physicians antiinflammatory agents were most frequently used. Chiropractic patients averaged 4 visits, and medical patients averaged 1 visit. On average, chiropractic patients showed improvement across all outcomes: 31% change in pain severity, 29% in functional disability, 36% in sensory pain quality, and 57% in affective pain quality. Medical patients showed minimal improvement in pain severity (6%) and functional disability (1%) and showed deterioration in the sensory (29%) and affective (26%) dimensions of pain quality. Satisfaction scores were higher for chiropractic patients. Outcomes for medical patients were heavily dependent on psychosocial status at baseline. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic low-back pain treated by chiropractors show greater improvement and satisfaction at 1 month than patients treated by family physicians. Nonclinical factors may play an important role in patient progress. Findings from the Health Resources and Services Administration-funded project will include a report on the influence of practice activities, including more frequent visits by chiropractic patients, on the clinical course of low-back pain and patient outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent and costly public health problem with few treatment options that provide consistent and greater than modest benefits. Treatment of CLBP is shifting from unimodal to multimodal and multidisciplinary approaches, including biopsychosocially-based complementary and integrative care. Multidisciplinary approaches require unique levels of communication and coordination amongst clinicians; however, to date few studies have evaluated patterns of communication and decision making amongst clinicians collaborating in the care of challenging patients with CLBP. METHODS: As part of an observational study evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an integrative, team-based care model for the treatment of CLBP, we used multiple qualitative research methods to characterize within-team cross-referral and communication amongst jointly-trained practitioners representing diverse biomedical and complementary disciplines. Patterns of communication and coordinated care are summarized for 3 cases of CLBP treated by multiple members (>=3) of an integrative medical team embedded within an academic hospital. RESULTS: Patients were aged from 36 to 88 years with varied comorbidities. Qualitative content analysis revealed 5 emergent themes regarding integrative patient care and treatment decision in this clinic: (1) the fundamental importance of the clinic's formal teamwork training; (2) the critical communicative and collaborative function of regular team meetings; (3) the importance to patient care goals of having the varied disciplines practicing "under one roof"; (4) a universal commitment to understanding and treating patients as whole persons; and (5) a shared philosophy of helping patients to help themselves. These key themes are all interconnected and form the foundation of the clinic's culture. CONCLUSIONS: Our qualitative findings provide context for current trends in enhancing patient-centered, coordinated, and team-based care; efforts towards better understanding interprofessional communication; overcoming barriers to successful collaboration; and identifying best practices for fostering clinical teamwork and a strong team identity. Our findings also support the need for further qualitative research, in combination with quantitative research, for evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of resource-intensive integrative models for the treatment of chronic conditions.

AB  - Providing care for a frail older adult who is suffering from dementia has been described as a stressful experience that may erode psychological well-being and physical health of caregivers. The burden and stress is increased when the caregivers are themselves elderly. The present study investigated the effectiveness of an 8-week stress-reduction program, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), among middle-aged and older family caregivers of persons with neurocognitive disorders, compared with a similarly structured, alternative intervention based on progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). Participants were randomly assigned to either MBSR or PMR (n = 28). The MBSR group showed significantly greater reductions in self-reported levels of depression and isolation from preto post-intervention, and those changes remained significant at 8 weeks post-intervention. Both groups showed similar decreases in levels of perceived stress, awakening cortisol levels, cortisol awakening response and daily average cortisol, and in resting systolic blood pressure from preto post-intervention. Both groups also reported similar increases in levels of mindfulness and self-compassion. Significant correlations with amount of daily practice of the instructed stress-reduction approaches were observed for several of the dependent measures. Results suggest that MBSR and relaxation-based interventions may both be effective in reducing psychological and physiological indices of chronic stress among older caregivers of relatives with neurocognitive disorders. However, further research, employing waitlist control participants will be necessary for unambiguous interpretation of the present results.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) is associated with numerous health-related benefits among adults with chronic diseases and the general population. As the benefits are dose-dependent, this review aims to establish the PA levels of adults with spondyloarthritis and to compare these to the general population. Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, PEDro, AMED, CINAHL) were systematically searched from inception to May 2014 using medical subject headings and keywords. This was supplemented by searching conference abstracts and hand-searching reference lists of included studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and observational studies of adults with SpA in which free-living PA or energy expenditure levels were measured. Subjects less than 18 years or with juvenile-onset SpA were excluded. Outcomes included objective and self-report measurements. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the RTI item bank. From the 2,431 records reviewed, nine studies involving 2,972 participants were included. This review focused on qualitative synthesis. Meta-analyses were not undertaken due to differences in study design, measurement tools, and participant characteristics. This heterogeneity, coupled with the risk of bias inherent in the included observational studies, limits the generalizability of findings. Objective measurements suggest PA levels may be lower among adults with spondyloarthritis than in healthy population controls. Self-reported PA and self-reported rates of adherence to PA recommendations varied largely across studies; higher disease activity was associated with lower self-reported PA levels. Physical activity levels may be lower in adults with axial spondyloarthritis, with higher disease activity associated with lower PA levels.

AB  - Background: Comprehensive medical assessments in the majority of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) have failed to assess working capacity. Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) has become increasingly popular in the evaluation of working capacity in CLBP patients. This study investigates the influence of functional testing on decision making concerning medical fitness assessments for work. Methods: A randomized clinical trial comparing the effect of a function-centred (FCT) versus a pain-centred treatment (PCT) in patients with CLBP was performed. According to the legal requirements physicians issued Fitness for Work Certificates (FWCs) after rehabilitation. In the FCT group physicians were in possession of the results of FCE while this was not the case in the PCT group. Three experts assessed the FWCs and rated the quality and the information provided regarding working capacity in the previous work. Results: Rating of the issued FWCs proved reliable (ICC=0.77-0.92). Quality of FWCs and information regarding working capacity in the previous work differed significantly between the two groups (chi-square, p=0.03, resp. =0.008). There was a trend towards a higher attested work capacity in the FCT group (Mann-Whitney, p=0.071). Conclusions: Functional Capacity Evaluation positively influences quality and information regarding working capacity of medical Fitness for Work Certificates in patients with chronic low back pain.

AB  - Objective: To examine the effect of a case manager–assisted rehabilitation programme as an add-on to usual physical rehabilitation in patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion. Design: A randomized controlled trial with a two-year follow-up. Settings: Outpatient clinics of a university hospital and a general hospital. Subjects: In total, 82 patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion. Interventions: The patients were randomized one-to-one to case manager–assisted rehabilitation (case manager group) or no case manager–assisted rehabilitation (control group). Both groups received usual physical rehabilitation. The case manager–assisted rehabilitation programme included a preoperative meeting with a case manager to determine a rehabilitation plan, postsurgical meetings, phone meetings, and voluntary workplace visits or roundtable meetings. Main measures: Primary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary outcomes were back pain, leg pain, and return to work. Results: Of the 41 patients in the case manager group, 49% were men, with the mean age of 46.1 (±8.7 years). In the control group, 51% were male, with the mean age of 47.4 (±8.9 years). No statistically significant between-group differences were found regarding any outcomes. An overall group effect of 4.1 points (95% confidence interval (CI): –1.8; 9.9) was found on the Oswestry Disability Index, favouring the control group. After two years, the relative risk of return to work was 1.18 (95% CI: 0.8; 1.7), favouring the case manager group. Conclusion: The case manager–assisted rehabilitation programme had no effect on the patients' functional disability or back and leg pain compared to usual physical rehabilitation. The study lacked power to evaluate the impact on return to work.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal disorder that manifests as peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis and spondylitis. PsA results in significant burden that impacts quality of life of patients. We examined the signs, symptoms and impacts reported by patients with PsA, to characterise the patient experience of PsA and develop a conceptual model representing this patient experience. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients with PsA recruited through the FORWARD databank. Spontaneous and probed signs, symptoms and impacts of PsA were assessed. Patients rated the disturbance of these concepts on their lives using a scale from 0 ('does not disturb') to 10 ('greatly disturbs'). Signs, symptoms and impacts reported by >80% of patients with a disturbance rating of >=5 were defined as salient concepts. Recruitment continued until concept saturation was achieved. RESULTS: 19 patients with PsA were interviewed. The interviews elicited 42 symptoms of which 8 had not been identified in a previous literature review encompassing 15 relevant articles. The most salient signs and symptoms elicited in the interviews were joint pain, skin symptoms, stiffness, swollen/inflamed joints and fatigue all with moderate to high disturbance ratings (range: 5.5-7.8). The most salient impacts were sleep disturbance, physical disability, effects on daily activities and feelings of frustration with also moderate to high disturbance ratings (range: 6.1-7.4). CONCLUSIONS: The interviews highlighted the adverse impact PsA has on the patient's life and may inform on outcome variables or areas suitable to be assessed in PsA studies.

AB  - Background Chronic pain is not only a physical disorder, but also a complex combination of biopsychosocial symptoms affecting each other. When in chronic pain, the patient's entire body becomes a source of pain, and eventually the pain occupies the patient's mind and entire life. The aim of the present study was to examine the life experience and management of chronic pain from the patient's perspective. Methods Thirty-four participants with chronic pain were interviewed. For 21 of the participants, the duration of pain was more than five years. Most of the participants had degenerative spinal pain. The transcribed interviews were analysed using Giorgi's four-phase phenomenological method. Results The results indicated that chronic pain impaired the participant's psychosocial well-being by controlling thoughts and making life itself painful. When life is filled with pain, the entire life is seen through pain. Continuity, unpredictability and the fear of the pain decreased quality of life. As a result of the interviews, the following subthemes were identified, based on the essential theme of 'the dominance of chronic pain': namely: 'pain is the master', 'life is not worth living', 'contextual pain' and 'waiting and hoping'. Conclusions Chronic pain may decrease the quality of the patient's life to such an extent that it may be regarded as not worth living. Multidisciplinary management of chronic pain may lead to a better health status and diminish the adverse consequences of chronic pain. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore participants' perspectives on the effects of chronic pain on the psychophysical unity. METHODS: Thirty-four chronic pain outpatients were interviewed, and the transcribed interviews were analysed with Giorgi's four-phase phenomenological method. The mean age of the participants was 48 years, and 19 of them were women. For 21 of the participants, the pain duration was more than 5 years, and most had degenerative spinal pain. RESULTS: The results of this whole research project indicated that the phenomenon chronic pain consisted of four essential themes: Pain affects the whole person, invisibility, negativity, and dominance of pain. This study concentrates only on one theme "Chronic pain affects the whole person", in which were found eight subthemes in the interviews. The strongest argument made by the participants was not the physical pain itself but the psychosocial consequences, such as distress, loneliness, lost identity, and low quality of life which were their main problems. CONCLUSIONS: In multidisciplinary holistic rehabilitation, it is essential to take care of the patient's psychological distress. A potential source of psychosocial symptoms may be the subjective responses to experience of chronic pain due to the subjective meanings of pain. Implications for Rehabilitation About chronic pain Pain is an experience, not only an aversive sensation. Intensity of pain describes only the sensation, not the experience of pain. In chronic pain, the main complaint may be not the physical pain, but the distress. In rehabilitation, the patient needs to be taken as a whole person. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation, including patient counselling should be the fundamental part of treatment. In rehabilitation, the individual meaning of chronic pain needs to be disclosed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Self-management is essential for individuals with chronic cervical spinal cord injury, but some cases of self-neglect have been reported. The objective of this study was to examine the establishment of self-management in order to help inform community care practice. METHODS: This was a qualitative study applying a grounded theory approach with semi-structured home interviews. We interviewed 29 individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries (aged 26-77 years) who were members of each of the three branches of the nationwide self-help group, or the clients of a home-visit nursing care station. Qualitative analysis was implemented from a time transition perspective consisting of the faint awareness period, the seeking period, and the adaptation period. The analysis included the perceptions and methods of self-management. RESULTS: The process of establishing self-management was abstracted into a core category of "continuous adaptation to minimize the extent to which the individual's life was disrupted and to allow them to continue to live within the community". This in turn consisted of seven categories. In the faint awareness period, subjects perceived that they "hardly recognized health maintenance needs", that they had difficulties in acknowledging the necessity of controlling physical conditions, and that they were dependent on caregivers. In the seeking period, they were "driven by handling uncontrollable changes" and they coped with those changes in their own way and sometimes did not consider it necessary to see a doctor. In this period, a process of "searching for the methods of being healthy somehow" begun and they started to understand the degree to which they could cope without medication, together with their own responsibilities, and searched for the best coping methods and acted on advice. In the adaptation period, individuals were "struggling to continue the established health methods"; "managing stress"; "prioritizing their own beliefs over medical regimens"; and "confidently modifying the established self-management methods". They employed self-monitoring, preventative measures for secondary difficulties, and stress management techniques. However, they also avoided medication through self-determination and they prioritized their established lifestyle over medically ideal behavior. CONCLUSION: Subjects learned sustainable self-management methods through trial and error, although in each period of adaptation, they sometimes failed to acknowledge the necessity of health maintenance and medical care, and they coped with their health care needs in their own way. Future research is essential to develop self-management programs that include the patient's own perspectives, to teach health maintenance methods that enable patients to balance social participation and self-management, and to establish cooperative networks among professionals who support the patient's home care.

AB  - Background: Although complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been associated with reduced morbidity among adults with chronic back pain, less is known about the association between CAM use and health care expenditures.Objectives: The objective of this study was to first estimate health care expenditures of adult CAM users and nonusers with chronic back pain and then assess CAM's influence on health care expenditures.Research Design: This was an ambidirectional cohort study.Data: Linked National Health Interview Survey (2012) and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (2013-2014).Measures: CAM use was defined as 3 or more visits to a practitioner in the 12 months before the National Health Interview Survey interview. Covariates included age, sex, race-ethnicity, and body mass index. The outcome was annual health care expenditures (overall and within 8 categories, including office-based visits and prescription medication).Analyses: Survey-weighted, covariate adjusted predicted marginal means models were applied to quantify health care expenditures. Survey-weighted, covariate adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to investigate CAM's influence on expenditures, and the Z mediation test statistic was applied to quantify the independent effects of CAM.Results: Overall, health care expenditures were significantly lower among CAM users with chronic back pain compared with non-CAM users for both 2013 and 2014: $8402 versus $9851 for 2013; $7748 versus $10,227 in 2014, annual differences of -$1499 (95% confidence interval: -$1701 to -$1197) and -$2479 (95% confidence interval: -$2696 to -$2262), respectively (P<0.001). Adult CAM users also had significantly lower prescription medication as well as outpatient expenses (P<0.001). CAM use was identified as a partial mediator to health care expenditures.Conclusion: CAM use is associated with lower overall health care expenditures, driven primarily by lower prescription and outpatient expenditures, among adults with chronic back pain in the United States.

AB  - Study Design: An electrophysiologic study to examine effects of exogenous application of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha ) activities and nociresponses of dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord at L5.Objectives: To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in the induction and development of hyperalgesia in neural mechanisms responsible for a radicular pain.Summary Of Background Data: TNF-alpha is found in the herniated disc and known to play a pivotal role in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia; however, it is not known whether TNF-alpha causes abnormal discharge in the dorsal horn neurons and enhances nociresponse.Methods: Single-unit activities of neurons in the L5 superficial dorsal horn were extracellularly recorded, using 28 urethane-anesthetized rats. The wide dynamic range and nociceptive-specific neurons activated by stimulation of the hind paw were selected. Effects of exogenous TNF-alpha were examined regarding 1) spontaneous discharges of wide dynamic range and nociceptive-specific neurons, 2) responses of wide dynamic range neurons to noxious stimulation, and 3) morphologic changes in the dorsal root ganglion.Results: Application of TNF-alpha to the nerve root induced 1) a significant increase in spikes/sec in spontaneous discharges of wide dynamic range and nociceptive-specific neurons, 2) enhanced responses of wide dynamic range neurons to noxious stimulation, and 3) inflammatory changes in the ganglion.Conclusion: These results suggest the possibility that TNF-alpha produced in the vicinity of nerve roots due to disc herniation might cause ectopic discharges in primary afferent fibers and thereby induce the prolonged excitation in pain-processing neurons responsible for radicular pain.

AB  - Chronic pain is quite prevalent and causes significant disabilities and socioeconomic burdens. Spinal manipulative therapy and other manipulative therapies are used to manage chronic pain. There is a critical knowledge gap about mechanisms and sites of action in spinal manipulative therapy pain relief, especially the short-term analgesia that occurs following a treatment. Endocannabinoids are an activity-dependent neurotransmitter system that acts as a short-term synaptic circuit breaker. This review describes both clinical research and basic research evidence suggesting that endocannabinoids contribute to short-term manipulative therapy analgesia. Determining endocannabinoids involvement in spinal manipulative therapy will improve its clinical efficacy when results from basic science and clinical research are translated.

AB  - Background. Multiple dimensions across the biopsychosocial spectrum are relevant in the management of nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). Cognitive functional therapy is a behaviorally targeted intervention that combines normalization of movement and abolition of pain behaviors with cognitive reconceptu-alization of the NSCLBP problem while targeting psychosocial and lifestyle barriers to recovery. Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of cognitive functional therapy for people with disabling NSCLBP who were awaiting an appointment with a specialist medical consultant. Design. A multiple case-cohort study (n=26) consisting of 3 phases (A1-B-A2) was conducted. Methods. Measurement phase Al was a baseline phase during which measurements of pain and functional disability were collected on 3 occasions over 3 months for all participants. During phase B, participants entered a cognitive functional therapy intervention program involving approximately 8 treatments over an average of 12 weeks. Finally, phase A2 was a 12-month, no-treatment follow-up period. Outcomes were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance or Friedman test (with post hoc Bonferroni correction) across 7 time intervals, depending on normality of data distribution. Results. Statistically significant reductions in both functional disability and pain were observed immediately postintervention and were maintained over the 12-month follow-up period. These reductions reached clinical significance for both disability and pain. Secondary psychosocial outcomes, including depression, anxiety, back beliefs, fear of physical activity, catastrophizing, and self-efficacy, were significantly improved after the intervention. Limitations. The study was not a randomized controlled trial. Although primary outcome data were self-reported, the assessor was not blinded. Conclusions. These promising results suggest that cognitive functional therapy should be compared with other conservative interventions for the management of disabling NSCLBP in secondary care settings in large randomized clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Explore the perspective of patients and professionals regarding non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and to define the patient's journey from diagnosis to treatment in order to identify unmet needs during the process. METHODS: A qualitative study was carried out in two phases. In the first part, five focus groups were held with rheumatologists, orthopaedist, physiotherapists, primary care physicians (PCP), radiologists and six narrative interviews with nr-axSpA patients. In the second part, a nominal group meeting was held to detect which needs were not covered in the nr-axSpA (all of whom had collaborated in the previous phase). RESULTS: The topics discussed with professional groups and patients were the appropriateness of the term and concept of nr-axSpA, the management of low back pain and inflammatory back pain in routine clinical practice, complementary test and the problem of waiting lists and finally the unmet needs both from a practitioner's and a patient's perspective. The final group explored solutions to the problems based on what was discussed in the first part of the project. Some of these solutions were strengthening relations between specialties, implementing high resolution consultations, rethinking the disability scales, offering better information to patients, designing resource maps and using different strategies to promote knowledge of the disease. CONCLUSION: Many different perspectives on the same disease have revealed the difficult journey of the patient with suspected nr-axSpA, while identifying problems and solutions. Key Points * Diagnosis of nr-AxSpA among health professionals outside rheumatology may lead to numerous turns and difficulties in the patient's journey. * The impact of delays and complications in the journey to diagnosis is not quantified but directly affects the state of well-being and health of patients. * Multidisciplinary care is far from a reality. Primary care (key specialists in any chronic condition), radiologists, orthopaedists, and non-physicians such as physiotherapists and psychologists are generally excluded from dealing with these patients, and often have to do their work outside of physicians, rather than working together in a truly patient-centred medicine.

AB  - Past research has consistently demonstrated high rates of psychopathology in patients disabled with chronic low back pain. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether functional restoration treatment of these patients would lead to significant changes in psychopathology. Fifty-six patients were evaluated for current psychiatric disorders, using a structured clinical interview for DSM-III-R disorders, upon admission to a comprehensive 3 week functional restoration program, and again at 6 months following their rehabilitation. Results clearly documented significant decreases in prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders, particularly somatoform pain disorder and major depression. Such findings demonstrate that effective rehabilitation can significantly decrease the high rates of psychopathology commonly found in chronic low back pain patients.

AB  - Chronic non-specific low back pain (LBP) is a burden to society in terms of cost, loss of productivity and personal function. NHS physiotherapy services are seeking to deliver quality, effective care that meets the needs of the patient and other stakeholders. In the current climate services are facing pressure from cutbacks and competition for contracts. GPs are key referrers in to the service, therefore it is essential to seek their perceptions of current services provision. An exploratory study using semi-structured telephone interviews was conducted using a purposeful sample of 16 GPs. Ethical approval was sought and approved. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and checked for accuracy by a second party. Thematic analysis was done to identify key themes. Three key themes were identified: Patient waiting times, effectiveness and quality of the service and effective communication. Clinical and cost-effectiveness, service integration, use of appropriate data including outcome measures and the need for effective discharge summaries were highlighted as being instrumental in the chronic non-specific LBP service development.

AB  - A 16 yr old female presented with generalized weakness and easy fatigability since 2 months. Her medical history included that she had sickle cell disease (ss pattern) on regular treatment. She denied smoking and consumption of alcohol. She had adequate calcium intake and her menstrual history was non-contributory. History of right tibial diaphysial fracture 1 year back followed by refracture at the same site 6 months later. On examination patient was 146 cm tall & weighed 48 kg. She had pallor, blue-grey sclera,scar mark of previous operation on right leg. Her mother and two maternal aunts also had blue-gray sclera. She had normal dentition and other systems were normal. Radiological screening showed diffuse osteopenia of all visualized skeleton, biconcave vertebral bodies in lumbar spine, Old healed fracture of right tibial diaphysis with intra-medullary nail in situ, wormian bones seen along the lambdoid suture, old healed fracture with sclerosis noted involving diaphysis of first metatarsal. Secondary causes of osteoporosis were ruled out. Skeletal involvement is sickle cell disease is usually in the form of avascular necrosis, dactylitis, joint effusions or osteomyelitis however osteoporosis and long bone fractures are not known in sickle cell disease. Owing to high index of suspicion a diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta was pursued, since the patient presented at 16 years age with relatively minor symptoms type 1A osteogenesis imperfecta (mildest form) was established. Systemic screening for disease complications included osteopontogram, audiogram and consultation with ophthalmologist and geneticist. Therapy with calcium and vit D was initiated and an in depth discussion regarding biphosphonates was pursued. Anaemia was corrected with blood transfusion and treatment of sickle cell disease was continued. Family screening was offered. Fractures particularly adults older than 45 are associated with osteoporosis. This case illustrates the importance of family history, fracture history and clinical correlation when assessing patients with osteoporosis. Mild OI most often presents after infancy and should be considered whenever children or adults have recurrent fractures. Early diagnosis of this disease by family physicians will enable initiation of therapy as well as patients education regarding management of modifiable risk factors linked with osteoporosis (e.g. diet, smoking, alcohol). Genetic counseling and family screening could also be offered.

AB  - Study Design: Patients completing a multidisciplinary pain treatment were contacted to obtain 13-year follow-up information on pain, mood, employment, and general health.Objectives: Study objectives were to determine if post-treatment improvements were maintained over a lengthy follow-up period and to compare patients' general health to norms of comparably aged persons.Summary Of Background Data: Although many studies have demonstrated the short-term effectiveness of multidisciplinary pain treatment programs for chronic low back pain, few studies have documented that these treatment gains are maintained over time. Only two studies have reported patient outcomes on a long-term basis (10+ years). Those studies have documented that patient gains during treatment are generally maintained during follow-up.Methods: An attempt was made to contact all patients completing an inpatient chronic back pain rehabilitation program at the University of Iowa's Spine Diagnostic and Treatment Center. Of the 45 participants, 28 were located and 26 agreed to participate in a telephone interview. Analyses of pretreatment and posttreatment data revealed these follow-up participants did not differ from the larger study sample.Results: Patients maintained their treatment gains in all areas (pain intensity and interference, negative mood). Additionally, patients showed levels of general health comparable to similarly aged peers with the exceptions of pain (more pain) and physical functioning (lower functioning, more pain interference). More than half the sample was employed; of those not employed, few reported this was due to pain.Conclusions: The data lend support to the long-term effectiveness of multidisciplinary treatment programs for chronic low back pain.

AB  - The effectiveness of exercise programs for chronic low back pain (CLBP) is dependent upon patient adherence which is problematic to measure accurately. This cross-sectional observational study aimed to compare patient-reported levels of adherence with physiotherapists' perceptions of patient adherence; and to explore the proportion of patients who could accurately recall and demonstrate the exercises contained within their prescribed exercise program for CLBP. Participating patients (n = 61) included those attending for a follow-up consultation with a physiotherapist (n = 15) at a consenting practice (n = 6) who had been prescribed an exercise program for CLBP. Patients were asked to self-report their level of adherence to the exercise program which was then compared to their physiotherapist's perception of adherence. Patients were also asked to recall and demonstrate the exercise program to an independent researcher, which was compared to the prescribed program. Results indicated that in total, 24 patients (39%; 95% CI: 27–52%) self-reported as being completely adherent compared with 10 patients (16%; 95% CI: 8–28%) who were perceived by their physiotherapists as completely adherent (raw agreement: 0.21). However, only nine patients (15%, 95% CI: 7–26%) were able to accurately recall and demonstrate their prescribed exercise program to the researcher, of which eight of these nine patients self-reported complete adherence to the exercise program. In comparison, only four of these nine patients were perceived by the physiotherapist to be completely adherent. These results suggest that patient adherence to home-based exercise programs for CLBP might be assessed more accurately using multi-faceted measures which include an observational component.

AB  - In the study that we describe in this article, we aimed to preserve the voices of people suffering from chronic pain by encouraging them to tell the story of their suffering. Participants ' stories reflect how chronic pain has altered their lives. This is partly due to their discomfort, but also to the frustration they experience from delays in diagnosis and treatment. Patients often pursue a lengthy quest for medical care that culminates in the diagnosis of an 'incurable' disease and a prognosis of disability. This in turn affects patient interactions with doctors and their social network. We illustrate how chronic pain leads to a sense of alienation or 'not-belonging,' whereby patients perceive pain as an entity parallel to yet dominating their own lives.

AB  - Rehabilitation is a key component of the National Service Framework for Long-Term Conditions, yet rehabilitation is a concept that is difficult to define. The aim of this study was to identify patients and professionals' definitions of spinal cord injury rehabilitation. A qualitative approach was adopted using ethnographic techniques. Purposive sampling was used to select informants in a spinal cord injury unit in England. The sample comprised 30 professionals (14 nurses, 5 doctors, 3 occupational therapists, 5 physiotherapists, 1 discharge planning coordinator, 2 clinical psychologists) and 20 patients (8 who had been injured for between 16 and 44 years and 12 who had been recently injured). Data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Analysis was iterative, involving identification of themes according to a variant of the constant comparison method.It was found that participants defined rehabilitation in three ways: 'toolbox' (where physical and psychosocial skills are provided); 'picking up ones life again'; and 'empowerment'. It is proposed that these three definitions form a process-outcome model that is neither static nor hierarchical, enabling patients to move back and forth in the model throughout their lives as their situation changes. An understanding of this rehabilitation model may help professionals provide rehabilitation that meets individuals' needs and goals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is widely known that the mind and the body, although described medically almost as separate entities, are in fact highly interrelated. This is not, however, always reflected within medical settings where physical interventions are often favoured over more holistic management, even in the case of long-term symptoms and/or pain where there is a strong evidence to favour the use of the latter. Mindfulness is an established and evidence-based intervention which can help people living with pain and physical symptoms. Interventions based on Compassion and Loving-kindness have also shown early promise but have not been fully explored. This study proposes a compassion-focused conceptualisation of persistent pain and reports on an intervention based upon this formulation. METHODS: The study took place within a routine clinical setting. Standardised outcome measures were collected pre- and post-intervention and effect sizes calculated for mean differences on each measure. Written qualitative comments that participants attributed to the group were also collected post-intervention and analysed with a thematic analysis. This was an uncontrolled, unpowered study conducted within a clinical setting which aimed to examine the intervention for any initial evidence of promise and to explore how it would be received by patients. RESULTS: The results of the study indicated that engagement of patients in the intervention was reasonable. Improvements were recorded in pain distress (effect size (ES), 0.47) and intensity (ES, 0.23), anxiety (ES, 0.72), depression (ES, 0.46) and self-efficacy (ES, 0.36). Following the intervention, patients described changes that were grouped into the categories of feeling different, doing things differently and changed attitude. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study has demonstrated that a group-based intervention based on a model of compassion and including mindfulness and loving-kindness exercise has potential as an intervention to be used within routine pain management settings.

AB  - A standardized curriculum back school (CBS) has been recommended for further dissemination in medical rehabilitation in Germany. However, implementation of self-management education programs into practice is challenging. In low back pain care, individual factors of professionals could be decisive regarding implementation fidelity. The study aim was to explore attitudes and experiences of professionals who conducted the back school. Qualitative interviews were led with 45 rehabilitation professionals. The data were examined using thematic analysis. Three central themes were identified: (a) "back school as a common thread," (b) "theory versus practice," and (c) "participation and patient-centeredness." The CBS and its manual were frequently described positively because they provide structure. However, specified time was mentioned critically and there were heterogeneous perceptions regarding flexibility in conducting the CBS. Theory and practice in the CBS were discussed concerning amount, distribution, and conjunction. Participation and patient-centeredness were mainly mentioned in terms of amount and heterogeneity of participation as well as the demand for competences of professionals. Factors were detected that may either positively or negatively influence the implementation fidelity of self-management education programs. The results are explorative and provide potential explanatory mechanisms for behavior and acceptance of rehabilitation professionals regarding the implementation of biopsychosocial back schools.

AB  - The conditions of work for professional drivers can contribute to adverse health and well-being outcomes. Fatigue can result from irregular shift scheduling, stress may arise due to the intense job demands, back pain may be due to prolonged sitting and exposure to vibration, and a poor diet can be attributed to limited time for breaks and rest. This study aimed to identify working conditions and health outcomes in a bussing company by conducting focus groups and key informant interviews to inform a Total Worker Health<sup> R</sup> organizational intervention. Our thematic analysis identified three primary themes: lack of trust between drivers and supervisors, the scheduling of shifts and routes, and difficulty performing positive health behaviors. These findings demonstrate the value of using participatory methods with key stakeholders to determine the unique working conditions and pathways that may be most critical to impacting safety, health, and well-being in an organization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was the analysis of the psychometric properties of the Ransford technique which is a qualitative scoring method of the pain drawing. It has been suggested that this method could be used as a brief screening technique for psychological involvement in pain complaints. METHODS: 109 patients with chronic back pain filled in the pain drawing which was rated according to the technique described by Ransford and colleagues in 1976. As external criterium of validity we chose a differentiated expert rating of psychological interference. RESULTS: The Ransford technique showed moderate to good coefficients of reliability (re-test, inter and intra-rater). On the other hand, the Ransford technique demonstrated very low indices of validity in order to give a prognosis about psychological interference. Sensitivity and specificity of the Ransford technique demonstrated inadequate values, which furthermore were independent from cut-off points. CONCLUSION: The pain drawing and the Ransford technique are not sufficiently sensitive and therefore allow no screening for psychological interference in complaints of back pain.

AB  - A cross-sectional evaluation of 117 people who sustained acute back injuries was undertaken within 15 days of the first report of the pain. The subjects showed no discal or neural signs and had not experienced previous episodes of back or neck pain. All subjects were given a structured interview and filled in a series of psychological evaluation instruments. Results show acute pain reactions to be comparable to those seen in chronic pain groups. The predominant emotion is one of frustration rather than anxiety or depression and considerable behavioural disruption is evident from this early point. The extent to which these data undermine the model of gradual evolution of chronic back pain problems is discussed.

AB  - Background: Across the lifespan, people with spinal cord injury (SCI) may experience preventable secondary health conditions (SHCs) such as pressures sores, muscle spasms and urinary tract infections (UTIs). Some factors influencing prevention of SHCs include social support, poor access to care and the prevention style of individuals. There is limited research on these factors. Objective: To explore personal factors influencing the prevention of SHCs in people with SCI. Method: An explorative qualitative study included participants recruited in an outpatient department at a rehabilitation hospital. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with patients with SCI. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was conducted using content analysis. Results: Seventeen individuals with SCI were interviewed. From the interview analysis, six personal factors were identified, namely, socio-economic status; mental well-being (forgetfulness, beliefs, attitude); lack of knowledge of SHCs and prevention; lifestyle choices and practising prevention care; patient activation (self-management, problem-solving, resilience, self-awareness, help-seeking behaviour) and owning an appropriate assistive device. Conclusion: Socio-economic status, mental well-being, knowledge of SHCs and prevention care, behaviour patterns, patient activation and owning an appropriate assistive device can influence prevention of SHCs. To enhance patient-oriented care, a model of care for people with SCI should consider these factors when developing prevention strategies. Future research could look into identifying environmental factors that influence the prevention of SHCs in people with SCI. Clinical implications: Tailored prevention strategies need to be developed, health professionals must ask patients about individual factors that may be barriers or facilitators to preventing secondary health conditions.

AB  - AIMS: (a) To investigate how widespread is the use of long term treatment without improvement amongst clinicians treating individuals with low back pain. (b) To study the beliefs behind the reasons why chiropractors, osteopaths and physiotherapists continue to treat people whose low back pain appears not to be improving. METHODS: A mixed methods study, including a questionnaire survey and qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews. Questionnaire survey; 354/600 (59%) clinicians equally distributed between chiropractic, osteopathy and physiotherapy professions. Interview study; a purposive sample of fourteen clinicians from each profession identified from the survey responses. Methodological techniques ranged from grounded theory analysis to sorting of categories by both the research team and the subjects themselves. RESULTS: At least 10% of each of the professions reported that they continued to treat patients with low back pain who showed almost no improvement for over three months. There is some indication that this is an underestimate. reasons for continuing unsuccessful management of low back pain were not found to be primarily monetary in nature; rather it appears to have much more to do with the scope of care that extends beyond issues addressed in the current physical therapy guidelines. The interview data showed that clinicians viewed their role as including health education and counselling rather than a 'cure or refer' approach. Additionally, participants raised concerns that discharging patients from their care meant sending them to into a therapeutic void. CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment of patients with low back pain without objective signs of improvement is an established practice in a minority of clinicians studied. This approach contrasts with clinical guidelines that encourage self-management, reassurance, re-activation, and involvement of multidisciplinary teams for patients who do not recover. Some of the rationale provided makes a strong case for ongoing contact. However, the practice is also maintained through poor communication with other professions and mistrust of the healthcare system.

AB  - Background: Across Canada, opioid-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and mortality have increased. A literature gap exists related to opioid prescribing and safety measure utilization patterns among nurse practitioners (NPs). Purpose: The objectives of this study were to (a) identify opioids prescribed by NPs in Ontario for pain, (b) examine safety measure utilization when prescribing opioids, (c) explore factors associated with safety measure utilization, and (d) survey NPs' opioid prescribing confidence. Methods: An explanatory sequential mixed method approach was used to measure quantitative and qualitative results in a sequential approach that achieves methodological triangulation. A survey was distributed to 2,094 NPs practicing in Ontario between May and August 2020. After quantitative analysis of 158 completed surveys, a qualitative phase was conducted that involved one-on-one semi-structured interviews with 14 NPs who completed the survey and agreed to follow up. Results: The top three opioids prescribed for acute and chronic pain reported by 158 NPs were hydromorphone followed by acetaminophen with codeine and oxycocet. The top three acute opioid-treated conditions were (1) fracture, (2) postoperative pain, and (3) joint or muscle strain/sprain. The top three chronic pain conditions were (1) cancer/palliative care, (2) chronic low back pain, and (3) osteoarthritis. Results from interviews demonstrated that inpatient NPs used safety measures less often than community NPs because of institutional policies that aid safe prescribing. NP preference for hydromorphone was rooted in its appealing side effect profile and ability to prescribe smaller doses. Limiting medication supply was considered the most effective opioid prescribing safety measure. NPs were more confident prescribing opioids with established diagnoses and less confident with unclear diagnoses, history of addiction, and chronic pain patients taking high dosages of opioids. Conclusion: Findings from this research can inform curricula changes to incorporate education related to opioid prescribing in the populations in which NPs expressed less confidence and opioid tapering for patients on high doses of opioids.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low-back pain is responsible for significant disability and costs in industrialized countries. Only a minority of subjects suffering from low-back pain will develop persistent disability. However, this minority is responsible for the majority of costs and has the poorest health outcomes. The objective of the Clinic on Low-back pain in Interdisciplinary Practice (CLIP) project was to develop a primary care interdisciplinary practice model for the clinical management of low-back pain and the prevention of persistent disability. METHODS: Using previously published guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, a clinical management model for low-back pain was developed by the project team. A structured process facilitating discussions on this model among researchers, stakeholders and clinicians was created. The model was revised following these exchanges, without deviating from the evidence. RESULTS: A model consisting of nine elements on clinical management of low-back pain and prevention of persistent disability was developed. The model's two core elements for the prevention of persistent disability are the following: 1) the evaluation of the prognosis at the fourth week of disability, and of key modifiable barriers to return to usual activities if the prognosis is unfavourable; 2) the evaluation of the patient's perceived disability every four weeks, with the evaluation and management of barriers to return to usual activities if perceived disability has not sufficiently improved. CONCLUSION: A primary care interdisciplinary model aimed at improving quality and continuity of care for patients with low-back pain was developed. The effectiveness, efficiency and applicability of the CLIP model in preventing persistent disability in patients suffering from low-back pain should be assessed.

AB  - Two hundred chronic low-back pain patients entering a functional restoration program were assessed for current and lifetime psychiatric syndromes using a structured psychiatric interview to make DSM-III-R diagnoses. Results showed that, even when the somewhat controversial category of somatoform pain disorder was excluded, 77% of patients met lifetime diagnostic criteria and 59% demonstrated current symptoms for at least one psychiatric diagnosis. The most common of these were major depression, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders. In addition, 51% met criteria for at least one personality disorder. All of the prevalence rates were significantly greater than the base rate for the general population. Finally, and most importantly, of these patients with a positive lifetime history for psychiatric syndromes, 54% of those with depression, 94% of those with substance abuse, and 95% of those with anxiety disorders had experienced these syndromes before the onset of their back pain. These are the first results to indicate that certain psychiatric syndromes appear to precede chronic low-back pain (substance abuse and anxiety disorders), whereas others (specifically, major depression) develop either before or after the onset of chronic low-back pain. Such findings substantially add to our understanding of causality and predisposition in the relationship between psychiatric disorders and chronic low-back pain. They also clearly reveal that clinicians should be aware of potentially high rates of emotional distress syndromes in chronic low-back pain and enlist mental health professionals to help maximize treatment outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Objectives  . Older African Americans have a significantly higher risk than older white Americans for cognitive decline and other health problems. Much of this may be due to the unique stressors, both historically and in-the-moment, that African Americans face in contrast to whites, such as gentrification and health disparities. Gender further exacerbates this effect. This study aims to understand stressors unique to older African American women, as well as coping strengths that have emerged organically over time for use in tailoring stress-reduction mindfulness classes in this community Design and setting  . A four-week mindfulness training class adapted from mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) was implemented in a historically black, gentrifying neighborhood in Portland, Oregon with 10 older African American women aged 50–89.  Main outcome measures  . Focus groups discussed stressors, coping, responses to mindfulness classes, and preferences to better reflect older African American cultural values and norms.    Results  . Stressors reflected participants’ intersectionality as older black women, including neighborhood and workplace race-based microagressions, and gentrification-related cultural and generational incongruences. Coping strategies included self-care, remembering core-self amidst stress, and drawing strength from family and faith. Participants found mindfulness classes appropriate for addressing stress and felt that classes provided a forum for connecting on issues of race and community.    Conclusion  . Tailoring classes to older African American women should consider integrating biblical teachings, African American instructors who understand socio-historical contexts of older black women’s stressors and strengths, and time for group-reflection to support community building.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Clinical lumbar instability (CLI) is one of the subgroups of chronic non-specific low back pain. Thai rice farmers often have poor sustained postures during a rice planting process and start their farming at an early age. However, individual associated factors of CLI are not known and have rarely been diagnosed in low back pain. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and individual associated factors of CLI in Thai rice farmers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 323 Thai rice farmers in a rural area of Khon Kaen province, Thailand. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using the 13-item Delphi criteria questionnaire, after which an objective examination was performed using aberrant movement sign, painful catch sign, and prone instability test to obtain information. Individual factors such as sex, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, smoking, and number of years of farming experience, were recorded during the face-to-face interview. RESULTS: The prevalence of CLI in Thai rice farmers calculated by the method described in this study was 13% (age 44+/-10 years). Number of years of farming experience was found to be significantly correlated with the prevalence of CLI (adjusted odds ratio =2.02, 95% confidence interval =1.03-3.98, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study provides prevalence of CLI in Thai rice farmers. Those with long-term farming experience of at least 30 years have a greater risk of CLI.

AB  - Insufficient physical activity is widespread amongst older office workers and has adverse effects on their physical fitness and psychological wellbeing, as well as being a cause of pain and of pain intolerance. Health challenges in older office workers may have an impact on their work productivity, quality of life, and involvement in the workplace. Differing exercise interventions have been employed to improve older workers’ health conditions, with Tai Chi being reported to be a suitable physical activity intervention for this purpose. Tai Chi appears to improve older adults’ physical function and psychological wellbeing, and to reduce pain in older adults. Additionally, many studies have found the benefits of resistance training in the workplace for older adults, especially for work-related pain issues. However, a systematic review found that few studies have examined the use of combined Tai Chi and resistance training to improve the physical function of older adults, and there is a lack of studies regarding the effects of this combined programme on psychological wellbeing and pain. Further to this, no study has examined the use of Tai Chi combined with resistance training in older office workers. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a 12-week Tai Chi combined with resistance training programme in improving physical fitness and psychological wellbeing, and in reducing pain in older office workers. This programme was compared to a Tai Chi exercise only programme in a group of 40 older office workers (i.e., ≥ 55 years) who engaged in less than 60 minutes of accumulated moderate intensity physical activity per week and were employed by a university in Australia. A pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) design was applied in this study. The first 10 movements of the 24-step simplified Tai Chi was chosen for use in this study, combined with Thera-band training using the hands. Prior to the pilot RCT study, an online survey was conducted to investigate the physical activity involvement, psychological wellbeing, and pain of older office workers aged 55 years and older, which could provide an insight into the physical activity intervention and workplace health promotion. The online survey reported that 27.3% of the older office workers had low levels of physical activity. Also, depression and anxiety were identified as two common major health issues in older office workers. In the pilot RCT study, 40 office workers aged 55 years and older, who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as provided signed consent forms, were randomly allocated into either the Tai Chi combined with Thera-band training (intervention) group or the Tai Chi exercise only (control) group. Outcome assessments were conducted at baseline, week 6, and week 12, using the 30-Second Chair Stand Test for lower limb strength, Grip Strength Test for upper limb strength, Function Reach Test for balance, 2-Minute Walk Test for walking endurance, Perceived Stress Scale for stress, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for depression, Geriatric Anxiety Inventory for anxiety, and Visual Analogue Scale for pain. The majority of the participants were female (77.5%), had achieved a higher education qualification (55%), worked full-time (77.5%), were married (62.5%), and recorded as being right-handed (92.5%). A significant difference in pain at baseline was found among participants in the control and intervention groups (p \u003c 0.05). Nine out of the 40 participants withdrew their participation during the study. An overall average attendance rate of 66.7% was recorded across the 40 participants, with 64.3% in the intervention group and 69.1% in the control group. After adjusting for the baseline pain scores and the attendance rate, analysis of data found that there was a statistically significant interaction between intervention type and time with anxiety scores (p = 0.04) and pain scores (p = 0.02). In addition, there were significant differences between groups in the improvement of lower limb strength (p = 0.01) and right upper limb strength (p = 0.04). No significant differences were found in other outcomes; however, the odds ratio estimation indicated that a higher percentage of participants in the intervention group had improvement in balance and walking endurance, and reduction in stress and depression compared with the control group. This study is the first known trial to test the effectiveness of Tai Chi combined with Thera-band training for health promotion in older sedentary office workers when compared to Tai Chi exercise only, with regard to physical fitness, psychological wellbeing, and pain. This study suggested that Tai Chi combined with Thera-band training has the potential to improve lower limb strength and upper limb strength compared to Tai Chi exercise only in older sedentary office workers. Limitations and recommendations from this study may be helpful in designing a large-scale RCT study regarding the effects of the Tai Chi combined with Thera-band training programme on health promotion in older office workers.

AB  - Chronic low back pain causes more disability worldwide than any other condition and is thought to arise in part through loss of biomechanical function of degenerate intervertebral discs (IVDs). Current treatments can involve replacing part or all of the degenerate IVDs by invasive surgery. Our vision is to develop a minimally invasive approach in which high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is used to mechanically fractionate degenerate tissue in an IVD; a fine needle is then used to first remove the fractionated tissue and then inject a biomaterial able to restore normal physiologic function. The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate the feasibility of trans-spinal HIFU delivery using simulations of 3-D ultrasound propagation in models derived from patient computed tomography (CT) scans. The CT data were segmented into bone, fat and other soft tissue for three patients. Ultrasound arrays were placed around the waist of each patient model, and time-reversal was used to determine the source signals necessary to create a focus in the center of the disc. The simulations showed that for 0.5 MHz ultrasound, a focus could be created in most of the lumbar IVDs, with the pressure focal gain ranging from 3.2-13.7. In conclusion, it is shown that with patient-specific planning, focusing ultrasound into an IVD is possible in the majority of patients despite the complex acoustic path introduced by the bony structures of the spine.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe health experiences, focused on gender and return to work, in subjects with chronic low back pain in a long-term perspective. The convenient sample consisted of 12 subjects who had attended a pain rehabilitation program 6 years earlier. Typed interviews were transcribed, and a content analysis approach was used. Five categories were found: coping, root causes, control/influence, pain, and sleep. The interviews showed that the subjects expressed well-being, although pain had become part of their daily life. However, both gender and well-being group differences were identified. The women and the group with reduced well-being used the root causes category in a higher degree than the men and the well-being group did. The conclusion is that there are differences according to both gender and return to work within the subjects with chronic pain and that these differences are related to both root causes and coping pattern. © 2006 by the American Society of Pain Management Nurses

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of recruiting, randomizing, enrolling, and collecting outcome data on veteran patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who undergo an 8-week, active exercise class with mindfulness (yoga class) and without (stretching class). METHODS: United States veterans with CLBP based on inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The study design was a pilot randomized controlled trial. Twenty CLBP patients attended a yoga class or stretching class once per week for 8 weeks at the Veterans Affairs Rochester Outpatient Center, Rochester, New York. The following measurements were obtained: recruitment or enrollment data, compliance data to include class attendance and home exercise, and compliance data regarding ability to collect outcome measures at baseline and at completion. Outcome measures included pain (PEG), quality of life (PROMIS Global Health Survey), self-efficacy (2-item questionnaire), fear avoidance belief, catastrophizing, and social engagement in addition to qualitative clinician open-ended questions postintervention. RESULTS: Forty-five veterans were queried regarding interest in participation. Of these, 34 (76%) met the study's criteria. Twenty (44%) agreed to participate and were consented, randomized, and enrolled in the study. Initial and final outcome measures were obtained for each participant (100%). Forty percent attended more than 80% of the sessions for both yoga and stretching groups. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, and collecting outcome data on CLBP veteran patients participating in yoga and stretching class. The data from this pilot will inform the development of a randomized, comparative effectiveness study of yoga with and without mindfulness in the management of CLBP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Medication non-adherence is a substantial problem among patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA). Our aim was to explore IA patients' perspectives on strategies to support medication adherence. METHODS: We collaborated with a leading arthritis patient group and conducted a qualitative study on individuals with IA who were taking at least one medication for their IA. An experienced facilitator led participants through a focus group exercise where participants were asked to design, and then discuss, strategies and/or tools supporting medication use. We applied thematic analysis using an iterative, constant comparative approach. RESULTS: We studied six focus groups with 27 participants diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and comparatively under-represented conditions in this research area such as Sjogren's syndrome. Five themes emerged throughout the analysis. Two themes - 1) adapting to life with IA and 2) the complexities and dynamic nature of taking medications - describe learning to live with a chronic condition and the challenges encountered when using long-term medications. Three themes - 3) developing lifestyle strategies for medication use (eg, having physical reminders and prompts), 4) becoming informed about medications (eg, information at time of diagnosis, means of receiving information) and 5) receiving support (eg, from health care team members, from family) - offer perspectives on facilitators to medication use. From the relationship between the latter themes, a framework was developed that encompasses means of receiving information and support as actionable targets for patient-oriented adherence interventions for IA. CONCLUSION: This patient-oriented study highlights the importance of developing timely adherence interventions for IA. Our findings also led to a framework describing means of receiving information, such as through digital media and support, including from health care team members and family, as actionable targets for patient-oriented adherence interventions for IA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a major public health problem, often encountered in primary care. Guidelines recommend early identification of psychosocial factors that could prevent recovery from acute LBP. METHODS: To review the evidence on the prognostic value of psychosocial factors on transition from acute to chronic non-specific LBP in the adult general population. Systematic review is the design of the study. A systematic search was undertaken for prospective studies dealing with psychosocial risk factors for poor outcome of LBP in primary care, screening PubMed, PsychInfo and Cochrane Library databases. The methodological quality of studies was assessed independently by two reviewers using standardized criteria before analysing their main results. RESULTS: Twenty-three papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria, covering 18 different cohorts. Sixteen psychosocial factors were analysed in three domains: social and socio-occupational, psychological and cognitive and behavioural. Depression, psychological distress, passive coping strategies and fear-avoidance beliefs were sometimes found to be independently linked with poor outcome, whereas most social and socio-occupational factors were not. The predictive ability of a patient's self-perceived general health at baseline was difficult to interpret because of biomedical confounding factors. The initial patient's or care provider's perceived risk of persistence of LBP was the factor that was most consistently linked with actual outcome. CONCLUSION: Few independent psychosocial risk factors have been demonstrated to exist. Randomized clinical trials aimed at modifying these factors have shown little impact on patient prognosis. Qualitative research might be valuable to explore further the field of LBP and to define new management strategies.

AB  - Objectives: Despite the significant biopsychosocial impact of chronic pain on the health and quality of life of an individual, as well as on healthcare utilisation, no published data are available on the prevalence of chronic pain in the South African primary healthcare context. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and intensity of chronic pain in patients attending primary healthcare facilities in south-west Tshwane. Design and setting: A prospective, cross-sectional study was carried out in four primary healthcare clinics, situated in south-west Tshwane. Subjects: The study was conducted on 1 066 adult patients, aged 18 years or older , over a nine-week period between October and December 2010. Outcome measures: The prevalence and intensity of chronic pain was determined. Results: Chronic pain prevalence was 41%. The confidence interval (CI) was 37.2-45.6. Chronic pain was most frequently experienced as lower back pain [prevalence 30.83% (CI: 19.56-42.09)] and joint pains [prevalence 23.48% (CI: 7.58-39.38)]. Chronic pain was significantly more prevalent with advancing age (p-value = 0.0014), in women than in men (p-value = 0.019), and in widowed and divorced patients, than in married and single patients (p-value = 0.0062). Patients with chronic pain reported their pain intensity over the previous month as maximum pain intensity (mean: 7.69 ± 0.99), minimum pain intensity (mean 2.54 ± 0.89), and average pain intensity (mean 4.57 ± 0.62). Conclusion: Chronic pain was highly prevalent in patients who attended primary healthcare facilities in south-west Tshwane. The intensity of pain was high in a significant proportion of patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Axial spondyloarthritis is a long-term rheumatic condition. The symptoms, including pain, can impact on the daily life routines and psychological well-being of individuals that are diagnosed with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Partners are often a main source of support for individuals who manage a long-term condition and they can also be affected by the illness experience, often themselves reporting elevated levels of emotional distress. Few qualitative studies have explored the impact of axSpA on partner relationships. This study addresses the social context of axSpA by investigating the experiences for both individuals with axSpA and their partners. DESIGN: Semistructured individual telephone interviews analysed using thematic analysis at a dyadic partner level. SETTING: Participants were recruited from the social media pages of a UK-based axSpA-specific charity. PARTICIPANTS: Nine heterosexual partner dyads (23-65 years), who were currently cohabiting, comprising nine individuals diagnosed with axSpA (n=6 females) and nine partners (n=3 females). RESULTS: Three themes 'Perceived relational closeness', 'Playing third wheel to axSpA' and 'Tensions surrounding a carer-type role' were identified. The findings illustrate how living with axSpA can influence closeness between partners and dominate daily decisions, particularly surrounding leisure activities. Partners commonly adopted a carer-type role, despite many individuals with axSpA expressing desire for a greater sense of autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an important insight into the lived experiences of both individuals with axSpA and their partners. Findings highlight the social context of managing a long-term condition and suggest the need for including partners within consultations, and the need for support provision for partners.

AB  - The aim of this study was to verify how the core stabilization training influences the pain and the stability of the low back. Six female with mean age of 23(±1) years old were volunteered for the study. They were submitted to 20 sessions of core stabilization training during 45 minutes with of three times a week. The subjects were not practicing any regular physical activity or therapy during the time of the study. The data collection involved the application of a pain qualitative grade and low back stabilization tests and after the period of training. The results indicated full absence or decrease of the low back pain for all subjects, including an increase on the stabilization and force of the low back and pelvis complex. The results found indicates that the training program based on 20 sessions of exercises using the core stabilization was really effective to decrease the low back pain without the application of drugs or analgesic therapies. This conclusion was supported by the decrease of the pain and the increase on the muscle strength observed on all the subjects.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The development of chronic pain after spinal-fusion surgery represents a significant source of morbidity. One of the predictive factors for the development of chronic postsurgical pain is inadequate acute postoperative pain management. Further, the up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) after surgery may result in neuro-plastic changes that may contribute to a progression from acute to chronic pain. The goal of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study was to examine the effect of perioperative COX-2 inhibition on acute and chronic donor-site pain in patients undergoing spinal-fusion surgery.Methods: Eighty patients scheduled to undergo instrumented posterior spinal fusion were randomized to either receive celecoxib 400 mg 1 hour before surgery, and then 200 mg every 12 hours after surgery for the first 5 days or receive matching placebo at similar time intervals. Patients were administered morphine via patient-controlled analgesia pump for the first 24 hours, and then acetaminophen and oxycodone tablets. Patients were asked to quantify their average pain on postoperative days 1 to 5. At 1 year after surgery, patients were questioned about the presence and subjective characteristics of any residual donor-site pain.Results: Patients administered celecoxib reported lower pain scores and less opioid use during the first 5 postoperative days. Chronic donor-site pain was significantly higher (P<.01) in the placebo group (12 of 40, or 30%) compared with the celecoxib group (4 of 40, or 10%) at 1 year after surgery.Conclusions: The administration of celecoxib for the first 5 days after spinal-fusion surgery resulted in improved analgesia and a reduction in chronic donor-site pain at 1 year after surgery.

AB  - Background: One factor affecting spinal cord injury (SCI)-related pain may be nicotine. Case reports have described a worsening of neuropathic pain from smoking and relief from abstinence. Neurobiological correlates also implicate the potential effect of nicotine on SCI-related pain. Method: The current study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design to examine the effect of nicotine exposure on subtypes of SCI-related pain among smokers and nonsmokers. Results: Whereas nonsmokers with SCI showed a reduction in mixed forms of pain following nicotine exposure, smokers with SCI showed a converse increase in pain with regard to both mixed and neuropathic forms of pain. The exacerbation of pain in chronic nicotine or tobacco users may not only elucidate possible pain mechanisms but may also be of use in smoking cessation counseling among those with SCI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were two-fold: (i) to describe physiotherapists' experiences of implementing a cognitive behavioural approach (CBA) for managing low back pain (LBP) after completing an extensive online training course (iBeST), and (ii) to identify how iBeST could be enhanced to support long-term implementation before scale up for widespread use. DESIGN: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 physiotherapists from six National Health Service departments in the Midlands, Oxfordshire and Derbyshire. Questions centred on (i) using iBeST to support implementation, (ii) what barriers they encountered to implementation and (iii) what of information or resources they required to support sustained implementation. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed using NVivo. Themes were categorised using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Evidence-based techniques were identified using the behaviour change technique taxonomy to target relevant TDF domains. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from interviews: anxieties about using a CBA, experiences of implementing a CBA, and sustainability for future implementation of a CBA. Themes crossed multiple TDF domains and indicated concerns with knowledge, beliefs about capabilities and consequences, social and professional roles, social influences, emotion, and environmental context and resources. We identified evidence-based strategies that may support sustainable implementation of a CBA for LBP in a physiotherapy setting. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted potential challenges for physiotherapists in the provision of evidence-based LBP care within the current UK NHS. Using the TDF provided the foundation to develop a tailored, evidence-based, implementation intervention to support long term use of a CBA by physiotherapists managing LBP within UK NHS outpatient departments.

AB  - Inactivity is known to have harmful effects on the physical and mental health of older adults. This study used a randomized, parallel trial design to evaluate whether daily text prompts to practice mindfulness would have a positive impact on the time that adults aged 50 years or older spend in aerobic physical activity. The participants were recruited from a certified fitness center and divided into mindfulness and control groups. For 4 weeks, they were exposed to the experimental conditions, with or without the morning text message. In the morning message condition, the mindfulness groups received a text message with the instruction to practice audio-guided mindfulness for 10 min, and the control group received a placebo message. The participants practicing mindfulness reported significantly more weekly minutes of aerobic physical activity and higher intrinsic motivation than the control participants. Mindfulness training was effective at increasing aerobic physical activity duration and might complement physical activity programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preliminary evidence suggests that chronic pain patients complete pain intensity measures using idiosyncratic methods. Our objective was to understand these methods and how they might impact the psychometric properties of the instruments. DESIGN: A qualitative focus-group based study. SETTING: An academic center in New York City. SUBJECTS: Outpatients (n = 36) with chronic low back pain, or neuropathic pain due to diabetes or HIV. METHODS: Participants were divided into three focus groups based on their pain condition, and asked to discuss pain intensity measures (visual analog and numeric rating scales for average pain over 24 hours; Brief Pain Inventory; and McGill Pain Questionnaire). Audio-recordings were transcribed and analyzed using an inductive thematic method. RESULTS: We discovered four main themes, and five sub-themes: 1) doubt that pain can be accurately measured (subthemes: pain measurement is influenced by things other than pain, the numbers used to rate pain do not have an absolute meaning, and preference for pain intensity ratings "in the middle" of the scale); 2) confusion regarding the definition of pain; 3) what experiences to use as referents (subthemes: appropriate comparator experiences and the interpretation of the anchors of the scale); and 4) difficulty averaging pain. CONCLUSIONS: The themes discovered suggest that patients include sensations and experiences other than pain intensity in their ratings, experience the rating of pain as a comparative task, and do not use the scale in a linear manner. These themes are relevant to understanding the validity and scale properties of commonly used pain intensity measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) could be influenced by socio-cultural factors. Pain narratives are important to understand the influence of environment on patients with chronic LBP. There are few studies that have explored the experience of patients with chronic LBP in different socio-cultural environments. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of patients with chronic LBP in Spain and Brazil. METHODS: A qualitative phenomenology approach was implemented. Chronic LBP patients from the University Hospital of Salamanca (Spain), and/or Federal University of Sao Carlos (Brazil) were included, using purposeful sampling. Data were collected from 22 Spanish and 26 Brazilian patients during in-depth interviews and using researchers' field notes and patients' personal diaries and letters. A thematic analysis was performed and the guidelines for reporting qualitative research were applied. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients with a mean age of 50.7 years (SD: +/- 13.1 years) were included in the study. The themes identified included: a) ways of perceiving and expressing pain-the participants focused constantly on their pain and anything outside it was considered secondary; b) the socio-familial environment as a modulator of pain-most participants stated that no one was able to understand the pain they were experiencing; c) religion as a modulator of pain-all Brazilian patients stated that religious belief affected the experience of pain; and d) socio-economic and educational status as a modulator of pain-the study reported that economic factors influenced the experience of pain. CONCLUSIONS: The influences of LBP can be determined based on the how a patient defines pain. Religion can be considered as a possible mechanism for patients to manage pain and as a form of solace.

AB  - Previous studies indicate that a worldwide measurement tool may be developed based on the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) Core Sets for chronic conditions. The aim of the present study was to explore the possibility of constructing a cross-cultural measurement of functioning for patients with low back pain (LBP) on the basis of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP and to evaluate the properties of the ICF Core Set. The Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP was scored by health professionals for 972 patients with LBP from 17 countries. Qualifier levels of the categories, invariance across age, sex and countries, construct validity and the ordering of the categories in the components of body function, body structure, activities and participation were explored by Rasch analysis. The item-trait [chi]2-statistics showed that the 53 categories in the ICF Core Set for LBP did not fit the Rasch model (P<0.001). The main challenge was the invariance in the responses according to country. Analysis of the four countries with the largest sample sizes indicated that the data from Germany fit the Rasch model, and the data from Norway, Serbia and Kuwait in terms of the components of body functions and activities and participation also fit the model. The component of body functions and activity and participation had a negative mean location, -2.19 (SD 1.19) and -2.98 (SD 1.07), respectively. The negative location indicates that the ICF Core Set reflects patients with a lower level of function than the present patient sample. The present results indicate that it may be possible to construct a clinical measure of function on the basis of the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for LBP by calculating country-specific scores before pooling the data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low-back pain. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are currently available and used for patients with low-back pain. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to assess the effects of NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the treatment of non-specific low-back pain and to assess which type of NSAID is most effective. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to and including June 2007 if reported in English, Dutch or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials and double-blind controlled trials of NSAIDs in non-specific low-back pain with or without sciatica were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality. All studies were also assessed on clinical relevance, from which no further interpretations or conclusions were drawn. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed. If data were lacking for clinically homogeneous trials, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence (strong, moderate, limited, no evidence). MAIN RESULTS: In total, 65 trials (total number of patients = 11,237) were included in this review. Twenty-eight trials (42%) were considered high quality. Statistically significant effects were found in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo, but at the cost of statistically significant more side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than paracetamol for acute low-back pain, but paracetamol had fewer side effects. There is moderate evidence that NSAIDs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low-back pain. There is strong evidence that various types of NSAIDs, including COX-2 NSAIDs, are equally effective for acute low-back pain. COX-2 NSAIDs had statistically significantly fewer side-effects than traditional NSAIDs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from the 65 trials included in this review suggests that NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute and chronic low-back pain without sciatica. However, effect sizes are small. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of NSAID which is clearly more effective than others. The selective COX-2 inhibitors showed fewer side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs in the RCTs included in this review. However, recent studies have shown that COX-2 inhibitors are associated with increased cardiovascular risks in specific patient populations. [References: 97]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Qualitative criteria, such as efficacy, utility and cost-effectiveness are essential for insurance and reimbursement companies to meet the costs for a multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) for persons with chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHOD: A systematic search concerning the qualitative criteria of MDT for CLBP presents an overview of the current literature. RESULTS: The search revealed 8 systematic reviews which document a moderate efficacy of MDT as a treatment for persons with CLBP although some reported restrictions. Analysis of 6 studies that have not yet been included in previous reviews confirmed the findings from these reviews. The comparison of conservative and surgical treatment for CLBP revealed that long-term outcomes hardly differed in quality, whereas surgical treatment was more expensive and contained more and higher risks. References on moderate to high cost-effectiveness of MDT are represented in 3 original studies. CONCLUSION: The MDT of CLBP is moderately efficient, purposeful, cost-effective and demonstrate an alternative treatment form to surgical treatment.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of this exploratory study was to examine the prevalence of overall pain generally and combinations of different pain locations, as well as their location, intensity, and duration in children and adolescents. METHODS: After consent was granted by the local ethical committee and the Ministry for Education, Research, Science and Culture, modified versions of the structured pain questionnaire of Perquin et al. were submitted to 1077 parents, children,and adolescents in the Lubeck region of Germany. Of the 1077 questionnaires distributed, 1030 were returned (95.6%), and 991 of the 1030 questionnaires (96.2%) could be included in the analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of overall pain during the preceding 3 months was 80.1%, while the prevalence of pain in more than one region of the body during the preceding 3 months was 66.3%. Of the children and adolescents, 57% had headaches, 43.2% suffered from abdominal pain, 41.6% had limb pain, 32.9% had back pain, and 30% suffered from sore throats during the previous 3 months. A total of 30.7% of the children and adolescents with pain reported that the pain had already lasted for more than 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pain in general is very frequent in children and adolescents. Further studies are required to investigate chronic pain in children and adolescents.

AB  - Older adults have unique perspectives on technology use that may involve having acquired disabilities, be more likely to be novice users and have more life experiences/biases that can influence user testing results. This literature review is aimed at assessing the application of basic User Centered Design (UCD) Instruments with Older Adults. 41 research articles published between 1988 and 2015 were gathered from different databases. Papers were included if the target audience was older adults and were analyzed only if the primary data collection instrument was any of the following: Questionnaire, Focus Groups, Cultural Probe, Diary Study, Think Aloud protocol, Interviews, Paper prototyping. The major findings from the resources reviewed showed that the application of UCD methods in older adults were commonly used to measure illness and understand their daily lives, experiences and living conditions. Only a few instruments such as Cultural Probe, Think Aloud Protocol and Paper Prototyping were used in the development of technology or devices. Many UCD methods may exist, but none appears to be a superior way to gather requirements. All methods have limitations when applied in an older adult context. A new design method approach should be developed to accommodate older adults in technology development process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain can disrupt the cortical representation of a painful body part. This disruption may play a role in maintaining the individual's pain. Tactile acuity training has been used to normalise cortical representation and reduce pain in certain pain conditions. However, there is little evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention for chronic low back pain (CLBP). The primary aim of this study was to inform the development of a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) by providing preliminary data on the effect of tactile acuity training on pain and function in individuals with CLBP. The secondary aim was to obtain qualitative feedback about the intervention. METHODS: In this mixed-methods pilot RCT 15 individuals were randomised to either an intervention (tactile acuity training) or a placebo group (sham tactile acuity training). All participants received 3 sessions of acuity training (intervention or sham) from a physiotherapist and were requested to undertake daily acuity home training facilitated by an informal carer (friend/relative). All participants also received usual care physiotherapy. The primary outcome measures were pain (0-100visual analogue scale (VAS)) and function (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)). Participants and their informal carers were invited to a focus group to provide feedback on the intervention. RESULTS: The placebo group improved by the greatest magnitude for both outcome measures, but there was no statistically significant difference (Mean difference (95%CI), p-value) between groups for change in pain (25.6 (-0.7 to 51.9), p = 0.056) or function (2.2 (-1.6 to 6.0), p = 0.237). Comparing the number of individuals achieving a minimally clinically significant improvement, the placebo group had better outcomes for pain with all participants achieving >=30% improvement compared to only a third of the intervention group (6/6 vs. 3/9, p = 0.036). Qualitatively, participants reported that needing an informal carer was a considerable barrier to the home training component of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot RCT found tactile acuity training to be no more effective than sham tactile acuity training for function and less effective for pain in individuals with CLBP. That the intervention could not be self-applied was a considerable barrier to its use. Trial registration isrctn: Isrctn98118082.

AB  - Abstract –   \r\nContext: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent and often disabling condition among adults. Meditation is a practice which uses a technique like mindfulness, or focusing their mind on a particular thought, activity - to train awareness, achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state. Cognitive – behavioral therapy (CBT) is a form of psychotherapy that has been documented to be effective in treating depression, chronic pain and other mental disorders.\r\nAim:  To compare the effects of both, CBT and Meditation on pain management in CLBP.\r\nMethod: 27 patients with CLBP between the age group of 36-50 yrs were selected. They were divided into 3 groups. A 4 week intervention of conventional physiotherapeutic exercises, Meditation and CBT was given. Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and Numerical Pain Rating Scale were used as outcome measures.\r\nResults: Our study shows significant results pre and post all interventions, but no significant difference can be seen when the three interventions are compared to each other (with p\u003c0.05)\r\nConclusion: On the basis of the result obtained, we can say that all three interventions have a positive effect in pain reduction in CLBP.Statistically, no intervention has a better effect over others. But clinically meditation group performed better.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recommendations on chronic diseases management emphasise the need to consider patient perspectives and shared decision-making. Discrepancies between patients and physicians' perspectives on treatment objectives, disease activity, preferences and treatment have been described for immune-mediate inflammatory diseases. These differences could result on patient dissatisfaction and negatively affect outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe the degree of patient-physician discrepancy in three chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], psoriatic arthritis [PsA] and psoriasis [Ps]), identifying the main areas of discrepancy and possible predictor factors. METHODS: Qualitative systematic review of the available literature on patient and physician discrepancies in the management of RA, PsA and Ps. The search was performed in international (Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Library, ISI-WOK) and Spanish electronic databases (MEDES, IBECS), including papers published from April 1, 2008 to April 1, 2018, in English or Spanish, and conducted in European or North American populations. Study quality was assessed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were included (13 RA; 3 PsA; 4 Ps; 1 RA, Ps, and Axial Spondyloarthritis). A significant and heterogeneous degree of discrepancy between patients and physicians was found, regarding disease activity, treatment, clinical expectations, remission concept, and patient-physician relationship. In RA and PsA, studies were mainly focused on the evaluation of disease activity, which is perceived as higher from the patient's than the physician's perspective, with the discrepancy determined by factors such as patient's perception of pain and fatigue. In Ps, studies were focused on treatment satisfaction and patient-physician relationship, showing a lower degree of discrepancy in the satisfaction regarding these aspects. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant degree of patient-physician discrepancy regarding the management of RA, PA, and Ps, what can have a major impact on shared decision-making. Future research may help to show whether interventions considering discrepancy improve shared decision-making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that public awareness of ovarian cancer is weak, and women are often diagnosed at late stages when treatment is difficult. This study aimed to determine the barriers for seeking early medical care and level of knowledge and awareness among women regarding ovarian cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire was designed and adapted from the validated cancer awareness measure. RESULTS: The recognition level of ovarian cancer symptoms among women in this study varied from 12-51%, and the most alarming ones, back pain, eating difficulties, and persistent abdominal pain, were missed by most of the surveyed women. The most recognized ovarian cancer risk factors were never being pregnant, having a history of infertility, and going through menopause, while the least recognized was having personal or family history of breast cancer. Non-UAE nationals women with higher educational levels had better knowledge of ovarian cancer compared to their peers. CONCLUSIONS: A change or implementation model is highly recommended in order to improve women's awareness of ovarian cancer symptoms. Strengthening education among women with regards to risk factors, early symptoms, and the need to seek early medical help should help to increase ovarian cancer awareness and reduce a delay in the diagnosis.

AB  - Environmental and emotional self-regulation skills play a critical role in promoting well-being of individuals and in encouraging healthy relationships. However, occurrence of chronic illness in one family member complicates routine dyadic coping processes for the couple. Additionally, according to environmental psychologists, self-regulation processes are influenced by individuals' perceptions of their socio-physical environments, and during times of chronic illness, the family home is frequently the primary site of dyadic coping. To date, few researchers have investigated the complex relationship among dyadic coping, the family home, and self-regulation processes in the context of chronic illness. The purpose of this paper is to report the results of qualitative research conducted to explore these relationships by analyzing participants' emotionally significant experiences within the family home. We purposively sampled and conducted in depth semi-structured interviews with 23 adults representing 10 families with one chronically ill adult family member. Representative illnesses included epilepsy (4) and chronic back pain (6). We used the Emotional Map of the Home Interview method (EMHI), an elicitation process in which participants are initially asked to place predefined positive and negative experiences on drawn diagrams of their homes. We analyzed the data through grounded theory coding methods, including open, axial and selective coding. Results of data analysis suggest that the family home operated as a critical socio-physical environment and had a profound impact on environmental and emotional self-regulation as well as on dyadic coping when one partner experienced chronic illness. Key selective codes derived from the data that reflect the variation and nuance within this impact included: "stress communication through the home space," "coping by spatial separation" and "coping by joint striving for at-homeness." These results reveal formerly hidden aspects of dyadic coping with chronic illness: the role of environmental cues, represented by the family home in this study, in perceptions of stress; the coordinated use of spatial-environmental contexts to engage the appropriate self-regulatory strategies for coping with illness-related stress. These findings demonstrate the utility of EMHI as an assessment tool and provide meaningful theoretical and practical information about dyadic coping among couples living with chronic disease.

AB  - Study Design: A prospective 9-year follow-up study involving randomized matched subgroups of 15-year-old schoolchildren with or without low back pain at baseline.Objectives: To evaluate the long-term persistence of initially reported recurrent low back pain, and to examine the significance of abnormalities found in magnetic resonance imaging of lumbar discs in individuals 15 and 18 years of age as possible contributors to persistently recurrent low back pain.Summary Of Background Data: In surveys among children and teenagers during the past few years, as many as half of all children in a community report a history of low back pain. The current results, in accordance with previous findings, indicate that there is a subgroup of adolescents with more chronic symptoms which, in the authors' opinion, deserves more attention. Disc disease accompanying low back pain is a key issue both in research and clinical practice. The significance of early degenerative findings in the lumbar discs is not known.Methods: In the survey of 14-year-olds (n = 1503), a subgroup (7.8%) with recurrent low back pain was found. A random sample of individuals with recurrent low back pain (n = 40) and an equal number of completely asymptomatic control subjects were selected for a comparative study. The selected groups were examined by magnetic resonance imaging at 15 and 18 years of age. The participation rate of youth at 14, 18, and 23 years of age for all three questionnaires was 82% (29 boys and 33 girls). Imaging data were interpreted by two blinded radiologists experienced in low-field-strength magnetic resonance imaging. In calculations of relative risks, the participants reporting recurrent low back pain in all phases of the study were compared with participants who had no persistently recurrent pain.Results: Eleven participants (35%) in the original group with low back pain persistently reported recurrent pain. In 15-year-old participants with disc degeneration, the relative risk of reporting recurrent low back pain up to the age of 23 years was 16 (95% confidence interval 2.2-118) compared with those having no disc degeneration. In addition, disc protrusion and Scheuermann-type changes at 15 years contributed to the risk of persistently recurrent low back pain.Conclusions: The authors' earlier findings already favored the hypothesis of a causal relation between the early evolution of a degenerative process of lower lumbar discs and recurrent low back pain in the near future. The current results further strengthen this hypothesis, indicating that individuals with disc degeneration soon after the phase of rapid physical growth not only have an increased risk of recurrent low back pain at this age, but also a long-term risk of recurrent pain up to early adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Reducing the disease burden of major depressive disorder (MDD) is of major public health relevance. The prevention of depression is regarded as one possible approach to reach this goal. People with multiple risk factors for MDD such as chronic back pain and subthreshold depressive symptoms may benefit most from preventive measures. The Internet as intervention setting allows for scaling up preventive interventions on a public mental health level. METHODS: This study is a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) of parallel design aiming to investigate the (cost-) effectiveness of an Internet- and mobile-based intervention (IMI) for the prevention of depression in chronic back pain patients (PROD-BP) with subthreshold depressive symptoms. eSano BackCare-DP is a guided, chronic back pain-specific depression prevention intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles comprising six weekly plus three optional modules and two booster sessions after completion of the intervention. Trained psychologists provide guidance by sending feedback messages after each module. A total of 406 patients with chronic back pain and without a depressive disorder at baseline will be recruited following orthopedic rehabilitation care and allocated to either intervention or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Primary patient-relevant endpoint of the trial is the time to onset of MDD measured by the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) at baseline and 1-year post-randomization. Key secondary outcomes are health-related quality of life, depression severity, pain intensity, pain-related disability, ability to work, intervention satisfaction and adherence as well as side effects of the intervention. Online assessments take place at baseline and 9 weeks as well as 6 and 12 months post-randomization. Cox regression survival analysis will be conducted to estimate hazard ratio at 12-month follow-up. Moreover, an economic analysis will be conducted from a societal and public health perspective. DISCUSSION: This is the first study examining an IMI for depression prevention in a sample of chronic pain patients. If this implementation of a depression prevention IMI into orthopedic aftercare proves effective, the intervention could be integrated into routine care with minimal costs and extended for use with other chronic diseases. Results will have implications for researchers, health care providers and public health policy makers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Studies Trial Register (DRKS): DRKS00007960 . Registered 12 August 2015.

AB  - Importance: Depression is a frequent comorbid condition in patients with persistent back pain and is associated with substantial adverse consequences, including the risk of developing opioid use disorders. Shifting the focus from depression treatment to preventing depression might be a viable way to reduce the disease burden. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based self-help intervention to reduce the incidence of major depressive episode (MDE) in patients with persistent back pain. Design, Setting, and Participants: Prevention of Depression in Back Pain Patients (PROD-BP) was a pragmatic, observer-blinded randomized clinical trial with a parallel design conducted in Germany. Eligible adults with a diagnosis of persistent back pain and subclinical depressive symptoms, but who were depression free, were recruited either on-site or after discharge from 82 orthopedic clinics between October 1, 2015, and July 31, 2017. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle from October 31, 2018, to April 30, 2019. Interventions: The intervention group received an e-coach-guided, web-based self-help intervention that was based on cognitive behavioral therapy and tailored to the needs of patients with persistent back pain. The intervention included 6 obligatory modules and 3 optional modules to be completed by participants as well as feedback from e-coaches. Both the intervention and control groups had unrestricted access to treatment as usual. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was time to onset of an MDE over a 12-month period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. Secondary outcomes included depression severity, quality of life, pain intensity, pain-related disability, pain self-efficacy, work capacity, and user satisfaction assessed with a variety of instruments. Results: A total of 295 participants (mean [SD] age, 52.8 [7.7] years; 184 women [62.4%]) were recruited and randomized to either the intervention group (n = 149) or control group (n = 146). The intervention reduced the risk of MDE onset by 52% (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.81; P < .001). Twenty-one participants (14.1%) in the intervention group and 41 participants (28.1%) in the control group experienced an MDE over the 12-month period. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 new case of MDE was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.79-9.44). Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this trial showed that among patients with persistent back pain, depression can be prevented by a guided web-based self-help intervention in addition to treatment as usual. This finding suggests that using a scalable digital approach to integrate psychological treatment into routine pain management is feasible. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register Identifier: DRKS00007960.

AB  - Whilst 'biographical disruption' remains important for explaining how people rebuild biography following the onset of chronic illness, it does not self-evidently explain the problem of managing a fluctuating chronic condition such as non-specific low back pain. Chronic illness rarely leads to long-term improvement; the trajectory is not always linear, and sudden or gradual improvements alongside deterioration are commonly experienced. In the case of low back pain, self-management often involves utilisation of non-pharmaceutical approaches, personal resources for accommodating pain and disability, as well as managing symptoms with clinical treatments to relieve pain. Such a multifaceted approach -- not only concerned with the reduction of symptoms -- shifts focus beyond the 'disease' state and a single point of disruption, drawing attention to the use of 'health maintenance actions' to facilitate a proactive response to illness management. We propose this new approach as an alternative way of understanding the experience of patients with fluctuating health conditions such as low back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of injections of therapeutic substances into the back as treatment for low back pain is unclear. Facet joint injections are widely used despite the absence of evidence of sustained benefit. We hypothesise that facet joint injections might facilitate engagement with physiotherapist-led, best usual care (a combined physical and psychological programme) and is a clinically and cost-effective treatment for people with suspected low back pain of facet joint origin. METHODS/DESIGN: We present here the protocol for a randomised controlled feasibility trial for a main trial to test the above hypotheses. Patients referred to secondary care with persistent non-specific low back pain will be screened and invited to take part in the study. Those who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited for a physiotherapy assessment to confirm trial eligibility and for baseline data collection. All participants (n = 150) will be offered the best usual care package with physical and psychological components. Those randomised into the intervention arm (n = 75) will, in addition, receive intra-articular facet joint injections with local anaesthetic and steroids. Primary outcome data will be collected using daily and then weekly text messaging service for a pain score on a 0-10 scale. Questionnaire follow-up will be at 3, 6, and 12 months. Evaluation of trial processes and health economic analyses, including a value of information analysis, will be undertaken. The process evaluation will be mixed methods and will include the views of all stakeholders. DISCUSSION: Whilst this trial is a feasibility study it is currently one of the largest trials in this area. The outcomes will provide some evidence on the use of facet joint injections for patients with clinically diagnosed facet joint pain.

AB  - Low back pain is one of the four most common disorders in all regions, and the greatest contributor to disability worldwide, adding 10.7% of total years lost due to this health state. The etiology of chronic low back pain is, in most of the cases (up to 85%), unknown or nonspecific, while the specific causes (specific spinal pathology and neuropathic/radicular disorders) are uncommon. Central sensitization has been recently recognized as a potential pathophysiological mechanism underlying a group of chronic pain conditions, and may be a contributory factor for a sub-group of patients with chronic low back pain. The purposes of this narrative review are twofold. First, to describe central sensitization and its symptoms and signs in patients with chronic pain disorders in order to allow its recognition in patients with nonspecific low back pain. Second, to provide general treatment principles of chronic low back pain with particular emphasis on pharmacotherapy targeting central sensitization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain causes substantial morbidity and cost to society while disproportionately impacting low-income and minority adults. Several randomized controlled trials show yoga is an effective treatment. However, the comparative effectiveness of yoga and physical therapy, a common mainstream treatment for chronic low back pain, is unknown. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized controlled trial for 320 predominantly low-income minority adults with chronic low back pain, comparing yoga, physical therapy, and education. Inclusion criteria are adults 18-64 years old with non-specific low back pain lasting >= 12 weeks and a self-reported average pain intensity of >= 4 on a 0-10 scale. Recruitment takes place at Boston Medical Center, an urban academic safety-net hospital and seven federally qualified community health centers located in diverse neighborhoods. The 52-week study has an initial 12-week Treatment Phase where participants are randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio into i) a standardized weekly hatha yoga class supplemented by home practice; ii) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol adapted from the Treatment Based Classification method, individually delivered by a physical therapist and supplemented by home practice; and iii) education delivered through a self-care book. Co-primary outcome measures are 12-week pain intensity measured on an 11-point numerical rating scale and back-specific function measured using the modified Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. In the subsequent 40-week Maintenance Phase, yoga participants are re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either structured maintenance yoga classes or home practice only. Physical therapy participants are similarly re-randomized to either five booster sessions or home practice only. Education participants continue to follow recommendations of educational materials. We will also assess cost effectiveness from the perspectives of the individual, insurers, and society using claims databases, electronic medical records, self-report cost data, and study records. Qualitative data from interviews will add subjective detail to complement quantitative data. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, with the ID number: NCT01343927.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is the most frequent pain condition in Veterans and causes substantial suffering, decreased functional capacity, and lower quality of life. Symptoms of post-traumatic stress, depression, and mild traumatic brain injury are highly prevalent in Veterans with back pain. Yoga for low back pain has been demonstrated to be effective for civilians in randomized controlled trials. However, it is unknown if results from previously published trials generalize to military populations. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a parallel randomized controlled trial comparing yoga to education for 120 Veterans with chronic low back pain. Participants are Veterans >=18 years old with low back pain present on at least half the days in the past six months and a self-reported average pain intensity in the previous week of >=4 on a 0-10 scale. The 24-week study has an initial 12-week intervention period, where participants are randomized equally into (1) a standardized weekly group yoga class with home practice or (2) education delivered with a self-care book. Primary outcome measures are change at 12 weeks in low back pain intensity measured by the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (0-10) and back-related function using the 23-point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. In the subsequent 12-week follow-up period, yoga participants are encouraged to continue home yoga practice and education participants continue following recommendations from the book. Qualitative interviews with Veterans in the yoga group and their partners explore the impact of chronic low back pain and yoga on family relationships. We also assess cost-effectiveness from three perspectives: the Veteran, the Veterans Health Administration, and society using electronic medical records, self-reported cost data, and study records. DISCUSSION: This study will help determine if yoga can become an effective treatment for Veterans with chronic low back pain and psychological comorbidities.

AB  - This explorative study examined the influence of chronic lower back pain on the motives for occupational performance. A narrative interview was conducted with seven Dutch clients. Three phases in the process of living with lower back pain were identified in which theself, the pain, and the environment were seen as interrelated elements that influence the creation of motives. In the first phase, clients wanted to meet social and personal expectations, which led to their ignoring the lower back pain. In the second phase, the pain took control andthe clients withdrew from social participation, which led to 'emotional pain.' In the third phase, clients became more conscious of the dynamics and dilemmas between the self, the pain, and the environment. Analysis of study results suggests that clients' narratives can helpoccupational therapists gain a deeper understanding of clients' experiences of dealing with chronic pain.

AB  - Sciatica is a common form of low back pain (LBP) that has been identified as distinct both in terms of the persistence and severity of symptoms. Little research has explored individual experiences of sciatica, and none focuses on individuals with the most severe, long-lasting symptoms who may experience the most profound impact. This paper addresses this gap through proposing a theoretical framework for understanding such experiences, that of biographical suspension as a form of liminality of Self. Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals with severe sciatic symptoms between January 2016-March 2017, as part of the UK-based SCOPiC (SCiatica Outcomes in Primary Care) randomised controlled trial. Data were analysed thematically using the constant comparison method. The concept of 'biographical suspension', originally developed in LBP, emerged as one whereby individuals put life on-hold in the expectation of an eventual return to their former, pain-free selves. Deeper analysis extended this concept to a form of liminality, whereby individuals are caught between pre- and post-sickness selves, unable to fully identify with either. This liminality is underpinned by ongoing beliefs about sciatica as a temporary and fixable 'injury' rather than long-term 'illness', even among those with long-lasting symptoms. This led to a disjuncture between individuals' ongoing pain beliefs and experiences, resulting in longer-term psychological impacts. Biographical suspension is further conceptualised as an experiential stage giving rise to four distinct short-term trajectories: i) symptom resolution leading individuals to occupy a clearly post-liminal state; ii) remaining in suspended liminality; iii) ongoing symptoms leading to a post-liminal state of resignation; ix) a state of being both between sickness and wellness, and straddling hope and fear; thus exemplifying differing states of liminality experienced over time. Findings have implications for the support provided in clinical settings to individuals who may struggle to self-manage due to sustained liminality of Self.

AB  - Up to 55% of the homeless population report health problems. They often use the emergency department (ED) to obtain care when the health needs are not urgent. Nurse-managed clinics have the potential to reduce nonurgent ED use and improve the health of the homeless. The purpose of this study was to establish baseline health data on homeless persons prior to attending a nurse-managed clinic. This study was a cross-sectional, retrospective health survey of homeless clients at a nurse-managed clinic. A total of 110 participants completed a baseline health survey. Of these, 61% reported that prior to coming to the clinic, they used the ED as a source of health care. The most frequent medical diagnoses reported were substance use disorders, depression, back pain, hypertension, and asthma. Providing care for chronic conditions at a nurse-managed clinic has the potential to improve health and reduce use of the ED.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some researchers think that patients with higher expectations for CAM therapies experience better outcomes and that enthusiastic providers can enhance treatment outcomes. This is in contrast to evidence suggesting conventional medical providers often reorient patient expectations to better match what providers believe to be realistic. However, there is a paucity of research on CAM providers' views of their patients' expectations regarding CAM therapy and the role of these expectations in patient outcomes. METHODS: To better understand how CAM providers view and respond to their patients' expectations of a particular therapy, we conducted 32 semi-structured, qualitative interviews with acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists and yoga instructors identified through convenience sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically using Atlas ti version 6.1. RESULTS: CAM providers reported that they attempt to ensure that their patients' expectations are realistic. Providers indicated they manage their patients' expectations in a number of domains- roles and responsibilities of providers and patients, treatment outcomes, timeframe for improvement, and treatment experience. Providers reported that patients' expectations change over time and that they need to continually manage these expectations to enhance patient engagement and satisfaction with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Providers of four types of CAM therapies viewed patients' expectations as an important component of their experiences with CAM therapy and indicated that they try to align patient expectations with reality. These findings suggest that CAM providers are similar in this respect to conventional medical providers.

AB  - Background: Disrupted self-perception of the low back might contribute to chronic non-specific low back pain. The Fremantle back awareness questionnaire is a simple questionnaire to assess back specific self-perception. The questionnaire has recently been translated to German (FreBAQ-G). The aim was to further investigate the psychometric properties of the FreBAQ-G, to evaluate its cross cultural validity in patients with chronic non-specific LBP and to explore potential relationships between body perception, pain, disability and back pain beliefs.Methods: In this cross-sectional multicentre study, sample data were merged with data from the validation sample of the original English version to examine cross-cultural validity. Item Response Theory was used to explore psychometric properties and differential item function (DIF) to evaluate cross-cultural validity and item invariance. Correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were used to explore the relationship between altered back specific self- perception and back pain parameters.Results: Two hundred seventy-two people with chronic low back pain completed the questionnaires. The FreBAQ-G showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84), good overall reliability (r = 0.84) and weak to moderate scalability (Loevinger Hj between 0.34 and 0.48). The questionnaire showed unidimensional properties with factor loadings between 0.57 and 0.80 and at least moderate correlations (r > 0.35) with pain intensity, pain related disability and fear avoidance beliefs (FABQ total - and subscores). Item and test properties of the FreBAQ-G are given. Only item 7 showed uniform DIF indicating acceptable cross-cultural validity.Conclusions: Our results indicate that the FreBAQ-G is a suitable questionnaire to measure back specific self-perception, and has comparable properties to the English-language version.

AB  - Spondylolysis is a common cause of low back pain in athletes, especially amongst adolescent athletes. The incidence of the condition in the general population is between 6%-8%;1,2 however in the athletic population the incidence has been reported as high as 47%.3 Spondylolysis refers to a defect or fracture of the pars interarticularis of vertebrae which can be either unilateral or bilateral. The pars interarticularis is the junction of the pedicle, articular facets and lamina. Historically stress injuries of the pars interarticularis were thought to be mostly bilateral4 and were noted in young athletes competing in sports requiring repetitive lumbar extension movements such as gymnastics and swimming.5 The growth of professional sport has seen more athletes exposed at a younger age to the repetitive actions which can lead to this condition. This, combined with advances in lumbar spine imaging in the past 20 years has revealed that unilateral spondylolysis is more prevalent than originally thought and further demonstrated that amongst participants in some sports, such as cricket for example, unilateral spondylolyis may in fact be just as common as bilateral spondylolysis.6,7 Studies using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or high resolution Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning have estimated that between 32% - 48% of all cases of radiologically confirmed spondylolysis in athletes are unilateral.8,9 Amongst cricket players, it has been shown that up to 55% of young fast bowlers may suffer from unilateral spondylolysis.10 If this injury is not managed appropriately it significantly limits player's ability to pursue their sporting career.10,11 A large amount of research regarding unilateral spondylolyis has involved this specific group of athletes.6,7,10-13 Unilateral spondylolysis occurs when repetitive stresses are placed on the pars interarticularis. The specific combination of repetitive extension, rotation and side flexion creates a shear force on the pars interarticularis that causes stretching of the pars and eventually stress microfracture.4 With ongoing stress an incomplete fracture occurs that can lead to chronic non-union. The condition occurs most commonly at the L5 vertebral level.9 A spondylolytic injury can have substantial impact on athletes, regardless of their chosen sport. The injury can cause significant pain and impediment to activity and lead to significant time away from sport.5,6 Despite growing knowledge regarding the epidemiology and aetiology of unilateral spondylolysis, the optimum management of athletes with this condition still remains unclear. It has been recommended by several review articles on spondylolysis that conservative management including rest; activity modification and physiotherapy, facilitate a patient's return to sports over time.4,5,14 A study by Blanda et al.15 demonstrated that a 6-month protocol of non-operative management led to apparent radiographic union of the unilateral pars interarticularis defect in 87% of patients, however the authors did not report on return to sport or clinical outcome in this group . Sys et al.8 noted similar outcomes for a subgroup of 11 patients with unilateral spondylolyis treated with lumbar bracing for an average of 16 weeks. These patients all achieved CT identified osseous healing of the fracture, with most of the athletes able to return to a previous level of sport.8 These studies indicate that conservative treatment of up to 6 months achieves positive results in most patients. However, it remains unclear in patients who do not respond to conservative treatment within six months, if surgery or ongoing conservative treatment is more beneficial, or even whether it would potentially be more beneficial for patients to have surgical intervention immediately after the initial diagnosis of the injury. Various methods of surgical fixation have also been described, with surgical fixation only attempted after an initial trial period of conservative management.4,5,14 The general aim of surgical intervention is a direct repair of the pars interar icularis. In the past spinal fusion was used as the first line of surgical treatment, however internal fixation devices have superseded spinal fusion as the gold standard surgical treatment.14 Despite technological advances the role of surgical intervention and its effectiveness remains controversial, and it remains unclear whether athletes with unilateral spondylolysis are able to return to the sports field more rapidly or if they are able to compete to the same level as prior to their injury. A search of the Cochrane (CENTRAL) and CINAHL databases using the keywords “unilateral spondylolysis”, “surgical versus conservative intervention”, and “systematic review” in an attempt to locate any recently published systematic review and/or protocols for review on the topic. No systematic reviews or protocols looking specifically at unilateral spondylolysis were identified. This highlights the value of the proposed research, which will provide sports rehabilitation practitioners with the first synthesis of the available evidence on the effectiveness of surgical intervention compared to conserv

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although most patients with low back pain (LBP) recover within a few weeks a significant proportion has recurrent episodes or will develop chronic low back pain. Several mainly psychosocial risk factors for developing chronic LBP have been identified. However, effects of preventive interventions aiming at behavioural risk factors and unfavourable cognitions have yielded inconsistent results. Risk tailored interventions may provide a cost efficient and effective means to take systematic account of the individual risk factors but evidence is lacking. METHODS/DESIGN: This study will be a cluster-randomised controlled trial comparing screening and a subsequent risk tailored intervention for patients with low back pain to prevent chronic low back pain compared to treatment as usual in primary care. A total of 600 patients from 20 practices in each study arm will be recruited in Berlin and Goettingen. The intervention comprises the following elements: Patients will be assigned to one of four risk groups based on a screening questionnaire. Subsequently they receive an educational intervention including information and counselling tailored to the risk group. A telephone/email consulting service for back pain related problems are offered independent of risk group assignment. The primary outcomes will be functional capacity and sick leave. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of screening for risk factors for chronic low back pain followed by a risk tailored intervention to prevent chronic low back pain. This trial will contribute new evidence regarding the flexible use of individual physical and psychosocial risk factors in general practice. Trial registration: Isrctn 68205910.

AB  - Despite excellent mortality indicators, there is clear evidence that the health status of the population of Geneva could be improved if more attention and resources were devoted to prevention strategies. To identify a set of robust health priorities an original approach was used triangulating results between three methods. The study calculated potential years of life lost, disability adjusted years of life lost, and conducted a Delphi survey to gather the opinion of health professionals and the general public. Several health conditions were unanimously selected by all three methods as top priorities: cardiovascular diseases, AIDS, respiratory cancer, breast cancer for women, suicide and traffic accidents. In addition, two determinants-alcohol abuse and tobacco abuse-for which a clear conceptual link could be established between all methods were chosen. Connections between priorities identified through the DALY and the Delphi method lead to further inclusion of chronic back pain and depression. Some issues solely identified through the Delphi survey were included as they were consistently considered important by professionals and the lay public alike-violence in the family, unemployment, social exclusion. These results indicate that health priorities, and by extension health care priorities, would benefit from using a mix of quantitative and qualitative research methods. The triangulation of results allows for a broader perspective and makes results more acceptable.

AB  - Introduction: Against the background of regional differences in morbidity and social determinants of health small-scale health services research is becoming increasingly relevant, particularly for planners of population-based integrated care models. Despite of longstanding research of regional variation especially by John Wennberg neither are there scientifically or practically accepted standards on how to identify regions which are in a special need for integrating health services nor is there a precisely defined set of methods which could be used to identify and prioritize problems in health services delivery. Policy context and objective: Based on discussions with the health authority of Hamburg the two neighbouring districts of Billstedt and Horn were predefined as a potential region for integrated care activities due to their comparable situation in terms of social deprivation as indicated by several social and demographical indicators. Having focussed on this region the health-related characteristics should be systematically analysed in more detail to develop a comprehensive concept of intervention. Therefore quantitative data analysis of several data sources (statutory health insurance claims data, data of the local health authority, reports of statistical offices and urban planning) as well as qualitative interviews with regional providers were conducted to better understand the health needs of the population living in this area and problems in the way healthcare is provided. Targeted population: The population living in Billstedt or Horn is socially disadvantaged compared to the general population in Hamburg as well as in Germany overall. For example higher unemployment rates, a higher amount of unskilled workers and lower average incomes can be observed which among other indicators is the cause of very low status indexes of these districts [1]. People living in Billstedt or Horn are indeed about four years younger than the population in Hamburg but the older they get the more health related problems they have compared to the average [2].Highlights: Calculating mean ages at the time of death and comparing residents living near chosen subway stations showed mean ages between 71 to 74 for the stations in Billstedt and Horn and for example mean ages between 82 to 87 in socially much more advantaged regions in Hamburg. The claims data analysis moreover indicates that several chronic morbidities like e.g. backpain, depression and diseases of the coronary system occur five to ten years earlier in Billstedt and Horn than averagely in Hamburg. For the region of Billstedt and Horn four key areas for potential interventions were proposed based on the claims data analyses: 1. Improving care for multimorbid elderly patients, 2. Prevention of the metabolic syndrome, 3. Better access to psychiatric care and 4. Improving child health. The qualitative interviews furthermore highlighted problems of unnecessary utilization like e.g. preventable hospital cases which occur due to existing or expected speech barriers in ambulatory care respectively a general unconsciousness of adequate ambulatory health institutions or problems of access to specialist care due to an observable unwillingness of several providers to open a practice in this region which is even exacerbated by a unwillingness of a certain amount of resident patients to leave their district to use health services. The establishment of a multilingual “retail clinic” in a large mall in Billstedt led by a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant who is in charge of offering care coordination consulting was proposed subsequently. Transferability: The methodology of this mixed-methods health services research as a starting point could be used in other settings where an integrated care model is planned. The identified problem fields and the thereupon developed intervention strategies might guide integrated care managers or policy makers on how to systematically plan, implement and/or further develop integrated care systems. Conclusions: The analysis of the regiona social and health characteristics enabled the preparation of a comprehensive concept of planned integrated care strategies and first specific interventions. Because of the systematic approach several providers and health insurances finally could be convinced to participate in a proposal to the German Ministry of Health to give a start up funding for this integrated care project in course of a so called “innovation fund”. The proposal was finally chosen to be granted with the funding amount of about 6.3 million Euros over three years starting in 2017.

AB  - Background: Back-related leg pain (BRLP) is a common variation of low back pain (LBP), with lifetime prevalence estimates as high as 40%. Often disabling, BRLP accounts for greater work loss, recurrences, and higher costs than uncomplicated LBP and more often leads to surgery with a lifetime incidence of 10% for those with severe BRLP, compared to 1-2% for those with LBP. In the US, half of those with back-related conditions seek CAM treatments, the most common of which is chiropractic care. While there is preliminary evidence suggesting chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy is beneficial for patients with BRLP, there is insufficient evidence currently available to assess the effectiveness of this care. Methods/Design: This study is a two-site, prospective, parallel group, observer-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT). A total of 192 study patients will be recruited from the Twin Cities, MN (n = 122) and Quad Cities area in Iowa and Illinois (n = 70) to the research clinics at WHCCS and PCCR, respectively. It compares two interventions: chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) plus home exercise program (HEP) to HEP alone (minimal intervention comparison) for patients with subacute or chronic back-related leg pain. Discussion: Back-related leg pain (BRLP) is a costly and often disabling variation of the ubiquitous back pain conditions. As health care costs continue to climb, the search for effective treatments with few side-effects is critical. While SMT is the most commonly sought CAM treatment for LBP sufferers, there is only a small, albeit promising, body of research to support its use for patients with BRLP. This study seeks to fill a critical gap in the LBP literature by performing the first full scale RCT assessing chiropractic SMT for patients with sub-acute or chronic BRLP using important patient-oriented and objective biomechanical outcome measures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is among the most common and costly chronic health care conditions. Recent research has highlighted the common occurrence of non-specific low back pain in adolescents, with prevalence estimates similar to adults. While multiple clinical trials have examined the effectiveness of commonly used therapies for the management of low back pain in adults, few trials have addressed the condition in adolescents. The purpose of this paper is to describe the methodology of a randomized clinical trial examining the effectiveness of exercise with and without spinal manipulative therapy for chronic or recurrent low back pain in adolescents. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing twelve weeks of exercise therapy combined with spinal manipulation to exercise therapy alone. Beginning in March 2010, a total of 184 participants, ages 12 to 18, with chronic or recurrent low back pain are enrolled across two sites. The primary outcome is self-reported low back pain intensity. Other outcomes include disability, quality of life, improvement, satisfaction, activity level, low back strength, endurance, and motion. Qualitative interviews are conducted to evaluate participants' perceptions of treatment. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of combining spinal manipulative therapy with exercise for adolescents with low back pain. The results of this study will provide important evidence on the role of these conservative treatments for the management of low back pain in adolescents.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pain catastrophizing is widely studied in quantitative pain research because of its strong link with poor pain outcomes, although the exact nature of this construct remains unclear. Focusing on its ruminative dimension, the present qualitative study aimed to explore a nascent aspect of pain catastrophizing - metacognition - by documenting people's attitudes towards rumination and examining how these metacognitions might influence the course it takes. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted in a tertiary care setting with 15 adults experiencing chronic (>=6 months) low back pain who scored highly (>=30) on the Pain Catastrophising Scale. Transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: The first aim of documenting pain metacognitions revealed both positive (e.g., 'thinking helps me to cope') and negative (e.g., 'rumination is uncontrollable') attitudes towards pain rumination. These were often held simultaneously, creating internal conflict. The second aim of exploring the influence of metacognition on rumination showed that both negative and positive metacognitions could fuel perseverative thinking. However, more nuanced negative metacognitions (e.g., 'worry is pointless') could help to end episodes of rumination by motivating the use of concrete problem-solving or active coping behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: While most participants described pain rumination as uncontrollable and harmful, dwelling on pain could be helpful when focused on tangible and solvable problems, thereby translating into adaptive coping behaviours that eventually interrupt rumination. Future treatments may be more effective if they are based on individualized formulations of pain catastrophizing that focus on its perseverative nature and implicit function. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Chronic pain affects one in five people, and psychological coping responses are key targets within gold standard biopsychosocial interventions. People who have elevated pain catastrophizing tend to have worse pain outcomes, including increased pain, disability, and emotional distress. What people believe about their own thinking (i.e., their metacognitions) influences how much they worry or ruminate. What does this study add? This is the first qualitative study exploring metacognitions in people with chronic pain and the first to target a purposive sample of people with elevated pain catastrophizing. People with elevated pain catastrophizing often see rumination as uncontrollable and harmful but may simultaneously believe it helps them to solve problems or feel prepared for future threats. Pain catastrophizing is not a stable and enduring trait but fluctuates both within and across individuals in response to pain, context, metacognitive beliefs about rumination, and coping behaviours.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore problem patterns of patients with musculoskeletal disorders assigned to and treated with a conventional (CR), behavioural-medical (BMR) or work-related (WR) rehabilitation concept. METHODS: We conducted interviews with 8 patients per concept, focus groups with 2 rehabilitation teams and 1 focus group with socio-medical assessors. For the interviews patients with chronic back pain were included, receiving inpatient rehabilitation. Data was examined by qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: We identified 7 problem patterns (one typical for patients in CR, 3 typical for specified subgroups in BMR resp. WR), differing in psychological co-morbidity, limitations of work-related activities and participation, psychosocial stress and pain. On the basis of detailed characterizations of these patterns, we developed recommendations for access and treatment management. CONCLUSION: The study specifies and demarcates different problem patterns in orthopedic rehabilitation and, therefore helps to further improve access management and treatment adequacy. Future studies should verify the generated findings on representative samples.

AB  - Study Design: A prospective cross-sectional analytic approach was taken.Objectives: This study sought to determine the relative contribution of the disc and the zygapophyseal joint as a pain source in patients with chronic low back pain.Summary Of Background Data: Previous studies have employed either zygapophyseal joint blocks or discography, but in no studies have both procedures been performed.Methods: Ninety-two consecutive patients with chronic low back pain were studied using both discography and blocks of the zygapophyseal joints.Results: Thirty-six patients (39%) had at least one positive discogram as defined by exact pain reproduction, an abnormal image, and a negative control. Eight patients responded to both a screening zygapophyseal joint block using lignocaine and a confirmatory block using bupivacaine. Only three patients had both a positive discogram and a symptomatic zygapophyseal joint.Conclusions: In patients with chronic low back pain, the combination of discogenic pain and zygapophyseal joint pain is uncommon.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional secondary prevention programs often fail to produce sustainable behavioral changes in everyday life. Peer-modeling interventions and integration of peer experiences in health education are a promising way to improve long-term effects in behavior modification. However, effects of peer support modeling on behavioral change have not been evaluated yet. Therefore, we implemented and evaluated a website featuring patient narratives about successful lifestyle changes. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to examine the effects of using Web-based patient narratives about successful lifestyle change on improvements in physical activity and eating behavior for patients with coronary heart disease and chronic back pain 3 months after participation in a rehabilitation program. METHODS: The lebensstil-aendern ("lifestyle-change") website is a nonrestricted, no-cost, German language website that provides more than 1000 video, audio, and text clips from interviews with people with coronary heart disease and chronic back pain. To test efficacy, we conducted a sequential controlled trial and recruited patients with coronary heart disease and chronic back pain from 7 inpatient rehabilitation centers in Germany. The intervention group attended a presentation on the website; the control group did not. Physical activity and eating behavior were assessed by questionnaire during the rehabilitation program and 12 weeks later. Analyses were conducted based on an intention-to-treat and an as-treated protocol. RESULTS: A total of 699 patients were enrolled and 571 cases were included in the analyses (control: n=313, intervention: n=258; female: 51.1%, 292/571; age: mean 53.2, SD 8.6 years; chronic back pain: 62.5%, 357/571). Website usage in the intervention group was 46.1% (119/258). In total, 141 trial participants used the website. Independent t tests based on the intention-to-treat protocol only demonstrated nonsignificant trends in behavioral change related to physical activity and eating behavior. Multivariate regression analyses confirmed belonging to the intervention group was an independent predictor of self-reported improvements in physical activity regularity (beta=.09, P=.03) and using less fat for cooking (beta=.09, P=.04). In independent t tests based on the as-treated protocol, website use was associated with higher self-reported improvements in integrating physical activity into daily routine (d=0.22, P=.02), in physical activity regularity (d=0.23, P=.02), and in using less fat for cooking (d=0.21, P=.03). Multivariate regression analyses revealed that using the website at least 3 times was the only factor associated with improved lifestyle behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Usage of the lebensstil-aendern website corresponds to more positive lifestyle changes. However, as-treated analyses do not allow for differentiating between causal effects and selection bias. Despite these limitations, the trial indicates that more than occasional website usage is necessary to reach dose-response efficacy. Therefore, future studies should concentrate on strategies to improve adherence to Web-based interventions and to encourage more frequent usage of these programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of lebensstil-aendern.de ("lifestyle change"), a website providing peer narratives of experiences with successful lifestyle change, and to analyze whether peer model characteristics, clip content, and media type have an influence on the number of visitors, dwell time, and exit rates. METHODS: An in-depth statistical analysis of website use with multilevel regression analyses. RESULTS: In two years, lebensstil-aendern.de attracted 12,844 visitors. The in-depth statistical analysis of usage rates demonstrated that audio clips were less popular than video or text-only clips, longer clips attracted more visitors, and clips by younger and female interviewees were preferred. User preferences for clip content categories differed between heart and back pain patients. Clips about stress management drew the smallest numbers of visitors in both indication modules. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are interested in the experiences of others. Because the quality of information for user-generated content is generally low, healthcare providers should include quality-assured patient narratives in their interventions. User preferences for content, medium, and peer characteristics need to be taken into account. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: If healthcare providers decide to include patient experiences in their websites, they should plan their intervention according to the different needs and preferences of users.

AB  - Study Design: This study describes the formation of nucleus pulposus tissue using a novel tissue engineering approach.Objectives: To determine if a construct composed of nucleus pulposus tissue on the surface of a calcium polyphosphate substrate could be formed in vitro with properties similar to native nucleus pulposus tissue.Summary Of Background Data: There is no optimal treatment for the persistent pain associated with intervertebral disc degeneration. Disc replacement using artificial intervertebral discs has met with some success, and biologic transplantation is limited by the availability of donor tissues.Methods: Nucleus pulposus cells were isolated from bovine caudal intervertebral discs. Cells were seeded at high density on the upper surface of a porous bone substitute material (calcium polyphosphate) and maintained up to 6 weeks in culture. In vitro formed tissue was compared to native nucleus pulposus for histologic appearance, biochemical composition (tissue cellularity, proteoglycan and collagen accumulation), and compressive mechanical properties.Results: When maintained on the surface of a three-dimensional substrate, nucleus pulposus cells formed a continuous layer of tissue with a proteoglycan content equivalent to the native tissue. Although collagen accumulation attained only 26% than that of the native tissue, there was no difference in tissue stiffness, viscosity, or weight-bearing capacity of the in vitro formed tissue when compared with the native tissue.Conclusion: Nucleus pulposus-like tissue formed in vitro on the surface of a calcium polyphosphate substrate resembles the native tissue in terms of proteoglycan content and compressive mechanical properties. These studies are the first step toward developing a functional spinal unit in vitro.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the representations and experiences of male workers regarding self-care, and the ways in which configurations of health-disease-care processes and aging affect male sexuality. A qualitative study was conducted that included semi-structured interviews with fifteen men living with a chronic disease. Respondents had an average age of 56 years old, most had not completed elementary school, and they were residents of a low-income neighborhood in the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Two findings emerge from the analysis: on one hand, conceptions of health care, gender, and the reproductive process are socially mediated by gender-biased sexual prejudices or reproduce stereotypes such as those based on sexual medicine; on the other hand, the aging process has repercussions on the conception and practice of male sexuality, and disease opposes values socially attributed to traditional masculinity. However, the aging process has made it possible for some to reinterpret gender relations, as well as ideals of dominant masculinity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most people experience low back pain (LBP), and it is often ongoing or recurrent. Contemporary research knowledge indicates individual's pain beliefs have a strong effect on their pain experience and management. This study's primary aim was to determine the discourses (patterns of thinking) underlying people's beliefs about what causes their LBP to persist. The secondary aim was to investigate what they believed was the source of this thinking. METHODS: We used a primarily qualitative survey design: 130 participants answered questions about what caused their LBP to persist, and where they learned about these causes. We analysed responses about what caused their LBP using discourse analysis (primary aim), and mixed methods involving content analysis and descriptive statistics to analyse responses indicating where participants learnt these beliefs (secondary aim). RESULTS: We found that individuals discussed persistent LBP as 1) due to the body being like a 'broken machine', 2) permanent/immutable, 3) complex, and 4) very negative. Most participants indicated that they learnt these beliefs from health professionals (116, 89%). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that despite continuing attempts to shift pain beliefs to more complex biopsychosocial factors, most people with LBP adhere to the traditional biomedical perspective of anatomical/biomechanical causes. Relatedly, they often see their condition as very negative. Contrary to current "best practice" guidelines for LBP management, a potential consequence of such beliefs is an avoidance of physical activities, which is likely to result in increased morbidity. That health professionals may be the most pervasive source of this thinking is a cause for concern. A small number of people attributed non-physical, unknown or complex causes to their persistent LBP - indicating that other options are possible.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Low back pain (LBP) is a lifelong problem for many. In acute episodes, or as a persistent condition, LBP is fluctuating in nature, with pain and other features of the condition varying in intensity and duration over time. Symptom flares (also known as flare ups) contribute to this variation and can have a great impact on the lives of those who have LBP. An important goal of treatments for, and research on, LBP is arguably to decrease symptom flare in both frequency and severity. However, this goal is problematic with little research, and no consensus, on how to define LBP flare. In particular, patients' understandings of LBP flare have received limited attention in the literature. To appropriately address this issue, we sought to understand how flares are conceptualized by individuals with LBP. METHODS: We used an inductive, predominantly qualitative methodology, conducting an online survey with 130 individuals who self-reported experiencing LBP. The survey investigated participants' views on LBP flare including its meaning, features and symptoms, and whether 'flare' and 'pain increase' were synonymous. Qualitative analysis of responses involved thematic and content analysis with descriptive statistics used for the quantitative component. RESULTS: Our data analysis found that participants identified many aspects of a flare to be important. Qualitative analyses highlighted a number of themes including that LBP flare was conceptualized as: (1) an increase in pain and other uncomfortable sensations such as paraesthesia or muscle tension, (2) an increase in the area, quality and/or duration of symptoms, (3) a reduction in physical, cognitive and/or social functioning, and (4) negative psychological and/or emotional factors. Flare was also discussed as a change that was difficult to settle. When participants considered whether 'flare' and 'pain increase' were synonymous, responses were evenly divided between 'no' (47%) and 'yes' (46%) with remaining participants 'unsure'. CONCLUSIONS: The key finding was that many people with LBP do not consider their condition to be flared simply on the basis of a pain increase. In general, other features were required to also change. Results highlighted that a narrow focus on pain is unlikely to differentiate minor pain events from a flare. These findings are important as they contrast with most commonly used definitions of a flare that focus predominantly on pain increase. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings have implications for understanding the trajectory of LBP over time. Understandings derived from perspectives of individuals with LBP highlight that defining flare in LBP is complex. In order to provide person-centred care, individual context and experiences should be taken into account. Therefore, understandings of LBP flare require consideration of factors beyond simply an increase in pain. A comprehensive, person-centred understanding of flare that includes a number of features beyond simply an increase in pain intensity is likely to be useful to better identify flares in research settings, assisting endeavours to understand and reduce LBP. Similarly, in clinical settings a nuanced conceptualisation of flare is likely to help health professionals communicate understandings of flare when working with individuals to manage their LBP.

AB  - Background and aims This study aimed to determine, from the perspective of individuals living with the condition, what decreases their low back pain (LBP). LBP affects most people at some point during their life. The condition has a meaningful effect on people's lives including pain, reduced physical and social function, mood fluctuations, and a reduced ability to work. Despite a considerable amount of research on the topic, few strategies to reduce LBP are considered successful, and there has been little investigation into what individuals with the condition believe reduce it. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature by investigating what individuals with the condition believe reduces their LBP. Methods We employed a descriptive qualitative design using a custom-built online survey. Participants were 130 adults in Australia who self-identified as having current or having had previous LBP with or without co-morbidities. Data from the survey responses were analysed using content analysis to determine which management approaches participants considered to be effective in reducing their LBP. Results Participants most commonly said that they believed their LBP was reduced by: heat/cold (86, 66%), medication (84, 64.1%), and rest (78, 60%). Next most common was activity/exercise (73, 55.7%). Other factors such as consulting a health professional (52, 39.7%), stretching/therapeutic exercise (50, 38.1%), resting from aggravating activities (45, 34.3%), and psychological changes (41, 31.3%) were mentioned, but considerably less often. Conclusions Current literature points to the inefficacy of many of the factors participants reported as helping to reduce the effects of their condition, including the treatments that were most commonly listed by the participants in this study, namely: heat/cold, medication and rest. A possible cause of this discrepancy might be that individuals with LBP consider temporary relief (on a scale of hours) to be an acceptable outcome, whereas clinical trials tend to consider efficacy by long term outcomes (on a scale of weeks, months or years). Implications There are several implications of this research. From one perspective, there is the implication that public education about efficacious treatments may need to be enhanced as there is a discrepancy between research findings and the perspectives of individuals living with LBP. On the other hand, these findings also suggest that it is timely to re-examine the focus of LBP research to consider outcomes that are valuable to people living with the condition, which this study implies should include short term or temporary effects. The findings may also help clinicians tailor management to suit the individual patients by increasing the awareness that patient and research perspectives may at times diverge.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the extent to which the principles of chronic pain or illness self-management (SM) programs might be adapted to focus on the workplace concerns of adults with persistent or recurrent pain and lead to new workplace intervention opportunities. Method: Eight SM programs were selected as representative evidence-based programs and then compared to extract common instructional elements. Elements were analyzed for potential application to four workplace problem domains identified by workers with pain: activity interference, negative self-perceptions, interpersonal challenges, and the inflexibility of work. Results: Of 24 instructional elements, 17 were shared by at least half of the SM programs. Instructional elements judged to be best suited for dealing with workplace concerns included those focused on reducing pain and discomfort, making informed decisions, communicating effectively, and dealing with thoughts and feelings. However, aspects of the workplace that may alter the feasibility or effectiveness of SM strategies include the level of physical demands and limitations, job leeway, and the nature of workplace roles and relationships. Conclusions: Principles and methods of SM intervention programs are generally well suited to address pain-related problems in the workplace, but tailoring of messages may be necessary to incorporate the unique organizational, physical, and social aspects of work into psycho-educational programs.

AB  - Background: Chronic low back pain is a common problem that has only modestly effective treatment options.Objective: To determine whether yoga is more effective than conventional therapeutic exercise or a self-care book for patients with chronic low back pain.Design: Randomized, controlled trial.Setting: A nonprofit, integrated health care system.Patients: 101 adults with chronic low back pain.Intervention: 12-week sessions of yoga or conventional therapeutic exercise classes or a self-care book.Measurements: Primary outcomes were back-related functional status (modified 24-point Roland Disability Scale) and "bothersomeness" of pain (11-point numerical scale). The primary time point was 12 weeks. Clinically significant change was considered to be 2.5 points on the functional status scale and 1.5 points on the bothersomeness scale. Secondary outcomes were days of restricted activity, general health status, and medication use.Results: After adjustment for baseline values, back-related function in the yoga group was superior to the book and exercise groups at 12 weeks (yoga vs. book: mean difference, -3.4 [95% CI, -5.1 to - 1.6] [P < 0.001]; yoga vs. exercise: mean difference, -1.8 [CI, -3.5 to - 0.1] [P = 0.034]). No significant differences in symptom bothersomeness were found between any 2 groups at 12 weeks; at 26 weeks, the yoga group was superior to the book group with respect to this measure (mean difference, -2.2 [CI, -3.2 to - 1.2]; P < 0.001). At 26 weeks, back-related function in the yoga group was superior to the book group (mean difference, -3.6 [CI, -5.4 to - 1.8]; P < 0.001).Limitations: Participants in this study were followed for only 26 weeks after randomization. Only 1 instructor delivered each intervention.Conclusions: Yoga was more effective than a self-care book for improving function and reducing chronic low back pain, and the benefits persisted for at least several months.

AB  - Although yoga is an effective treatment for chronic low back pain, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for its benefits. In a trial comparing yoga to intensive stretching and self-care, we explored whether physical (hours of back exercise/week), cognitive (fear avoidance, body awareness, and self-efficacy), affective (psychological distress, perceived stress, positive states of mind, and sleep), and physiological factors (cortisol, DHEA) mediated the effects of yoga or stretching on back-related dysfunction (Roland-Morris Disability Scale (RDQ)). For yoga, 36% of the effect on 12-week RDQ was mediated by increased self-efficacy, 18% by sleep disturbance, 9% by hours of back exercise, and 61% by the best combination of all possible mediators (6 mediators). For stretching, 23% of the effect was mediated by increased self-efficacy, 14% by days of back exercise, and 50% by the best combination of all possible mediators (7 mediators). In open-ended questions, >=20% of participants noted the following treatment benefits: learning new exercises (both groups), relaxation, increased awareness, and the benefits of breathing (yoga), benefits of regular practice (stretching). Although both self-efficacy and hours of back exercise were the strongest mediators for each intervention, compared to self-care, qualitative data suggest that they may exert their benefits through partially distinct mechanisms.

AB  - Objectives:T'ai chi (TC) has been found effective for improving chronic low back pain (cLBP). However, such studies did not include adults over 65 years of age. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of TC in this population compared with Health Education (HE) and with Usual Care (UC). Design: Feasibility randomized controlled trial. Settings/Location: Participants were recruited from Kaiser Permanente Washington and classes took place in a Kaiser facility. Patients: Adults 65 years of age and older with cLBP. Interventions: Twenty-eight participants were randomized to 12 weeks of TC followed by a 24-week tapered TC program, 12 were assigned to a 12-week HE intervention and 17 were assigned to UC only. Outcome Measures: Feasibility and acceptability were determined by recruitment, retention and 12-, 26-, and 52-week follow-up rates, instructor adherence to protocol, class attendance, TC home practice, class satisfaction, and adverse events. Results: Fifty-seven participants were enrolled in two cohorts of 28 and 29 during two 4-month recruitment periods. Questionnaire follow-up completion rates ranged between 88% and 93%. Two major class protocol deviations were noted in TC and none in HE. Sixty-two percent of TC participants versus 50% of HE participants attended at least 70% of the classes during the 12-week initial intervention period. Weekly rates of TC home practice were high among class attendees (median of 4.2 days) at 12 weeks, with fewer people practicing at 26 and 52 weeks. By 52 weeks, 70% of TC participants reported practicing the week before, with a median of 3 days per week and 15 min/session. TC participants rated the helpfulness of their classes significantly higher than did HE participants, but the groups were similarly likely to recommend the classes. Conclusion: The TC intervention is feasible in this population, while the HE group requires modifications in delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To further refine the wording of screening questions and examine their face validity through cognitive interviews with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and chronic mechanical back pain patients. METHODS: In-depth, semi-structured cognitive interviews were conducted with 30 patients (10 axSpA; 20 chronic mechanical back pain patients) to assess the face validity and comprehensibility of the screening questions. The interview protocol focused on 12 questions/domains including participants' feedback/thoughts on the duration of suffering from back pain, age at onset of back pain, pace of back pain development, improvement of pain with movement or rest, nocturnal back pain improving upon awakening, pain in other parts of the body, responsiveness of pain to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, history of autoimmune conditions, and domains such as sleep, sitting, and stiffness. The Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Flesch reading ease scores were then analyzed for the revised versions of screening questions. RESULTS: Participants preferred questions that allowed them to provide more details regarding the frequency of their symptoms. Questions were refined for clarity and eliminated if participants considered them to be irrelevant (e.g., NSAIDs). Two sample screeners were derived from twelve questions each with an overall reading grade of 7.5 and reading ease of 65.7%. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to design a screening tool that is accessible to most (e.g., reading level) and clear to individuals with back pain. An evidence-based approach to demonstrate the validity of the screening tool will be critical for it to be implemented widely into clinical practice. Key Points * Our study developed two sample screeners that are clear to individuals with back pain and accessible to most with an overall Flesch-Kincaid reading grade of 7.5 and Flesch reading ease of 65.7%. * Questions that were considered irrelevant to participants were eliminated such as responsiveness of pain to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). * It is feasible to design a screening tool that is accessible to most (e.g., reading level) and clear to individuals with back pain.

AB  - Background: Existing research on the lived experience of those with spinal cord injury (SCI) resulting in paraplegia who use a manual wheelchair and experience shoulder pain is extremely limited. This research aimed to begin the process of understanding the lived experience of this population and to describe how chronic shoulder pain impacts occupational engagement and quality of life. Method: A phenomenological approach using a constant comparative method was used to analyze data and to construct and redefine themes throughout the research process. The qualitative data obtained from two semi-structured interviews with the four study participants is presented below. Results: Five overarching themes emerged. The themes of putting on the brakes, intrinsic factors, extrinsic factors, hope, and resilience emerged among the participants to describe their lived experience of shoulder pain as a manual wheelchair user with SCI. Conclusion: The themes presented increased the understanding of the lived experience of shoulder pain in this population. Though the experience was unique to each participant, many similarities emerged from the themes, such as the benefit of having a strong support network including others wheelchair users with SCI and demonstrating a resilient spirit.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: One of the greatest obstacles to identifying the most effective therapy for chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the lack of standardized outcome measures for assessing treatment effect in clinical trials. The aim of the OMERACT Special Interest Group was to discuss the development and validation of a preliminary responder index in CLBP. METHODS: Patient data from 5 clinical trials of celecoxib and valdecoxib use in CLBP were used to assess the reliability and validity of multiple items in the outcome domains of pain, functioning, and overall impression of health. Candidate preliminary responder indices were selected on the basis of effect size, high chi-square test values, and a placebo response rate < or = 25%. RESULTS: Candidate indices comprised improvements in single outcome measures and combinations of improvements and/or avoidance of worsening in multiple measures. The preliminary choice for the responder index was at least 30% improvement in pain, with an improvement of at least 30% in patient global assessment and no worsening in function. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to refine a responder index for CLBP trials that is clinically relevant, reliable, and easy to administer for standardizing assessments across clinical trials.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Disabling chronic low back pain (CLBP) is associated with negative beliefs and behaviours, which are influenced by culture, religion and interactions with healthcare practitioners (HCPs). In the UK, HCPs encounter people from different cultures and ethnic backgrounds, with South Asian Indians (including Punjabis) forming the largest ethnic minority group. Better understanding of the beliefs and experiences of ethnic minorities with CLBP might inform effective management. OBJECTIVES: To explore the CLBP beliefs and experiences of English-speaking Punjabi and white British people living with CLBP, explore how beliefs may influence the lived experience of CLBP and conduct cross-cultural comparisons between the two groups. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured interviews set within an interpretive description framework and thematic analysis. SETTING: A National Health Service hospital physiotherapy department, Leicester, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 10 CLBP participants (5 English-speaking Punjabi and 5 white British) purposively recruited from physiotherapy waiting lists. RESULTS: Participants from both groups held negative biomedical CLBP beliefs such as the 'spine is weak', experienced unfulfilling interactions with HCPs commonly due to a perceived lack of support and negative psychosocial dimensions of CLBP with most participants catastrophising about their CLBP. Specific findings to Punjabi participants included (1) disruption to cultural-religious well-being, as well as (2) a perceived lack of understanding and empathy regarding their CLBP from the Punjabi community. In contrast to their white British counterparts, Punjabi participants reported initially using passive coping strategies; however, all participants reported a transition towards active coping strategies. CONCLUSION: CLBP beliefs and experiences, irrespective of ethnicity, were primarily biomedically orientated. However, cross-cultural differences included cultural-religious well-being, the community response to CLBP experienced by Punjabi participants and coping styles. These findings might help inform management of people with CLBP.

AB  - To explore and identify barriers and facilitators to engagement with eHealth technologies among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Qualitative descriptive study. This study was conducted in the general community setting. Community-dwelling individuals with SCI were recruited across Canada. The average age of the 20 participants was 48 years old; 8 participants were male, 12 participants experienced traumatic SCI. Not applicable. Data were collected via one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of 20 participants enrolled in a larger, clinical trial. Analysis of the transcripts was undertaken using a four-phase process of content analysis. Our analysis identified three main barriers and facilitators to engagement with eHealth technologies. Barriers included (1) overcoming a digital divide to comprehending and utilizing mHealth technologies, and (2) navigating internet resources that provide too much information, and (3) interacting with these technologies despite having limited hand function. Facilitators included (1) being able to use voice activation features, (2) being able to interact in an online community network, and (3) having previous successful experiences with eHealth technologies. By identifying barriers and facilitators to eHealth technology use among people with SCIU, these findings may have short-term impacts on informing researchers and clinicians on important factors impacting engagement of individuals with SCI with telemedicine, mobile, and web apps, and long-term impacts on informing future development of eHealth interventions and tools among chronic disease populations. We report no real or perceived conflicts of interest.

AB  - As eHealth technologies become a more prevalent means to access care and self-manage health, it is important to identify the unique facilitators and barriers to their use. Few studies have evaluated the use or potential use of eHealth technologies in spinal cord injury (SCI) populations. The primary objective of this study was to explore and identify barriers and facilitators to engagement with eHealth technologies among individuals with SCI. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. Data were collected via one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with a subsample of 20 community-dwelling participants enrolled in a larger clinical trial. Analysis of the transcripts was undertaken using a four-phase process of content analysis. Our analysis identified three barriers to engagement with eHealth technologies, including (1) overcoming a digital divide to comprehending and utilizing eHealth technologies, (2) navigating internet resources that provide too much information, and (3) interacting with these technologies despite having limited hand function. Our analysis also identified three facilitators to using eHealth technologies, including (1) having previous successful experiences with eHealth technologies, (2) being able to use voice activation features, and (3) being able to interact in an online community network. By exploring barriers and facilitators to eHealth technology use, these findings may have a short-term impact on informing researchers and clinicians on important factors affecting engagement of individuals with SCI with telemedicine, mobile, and web applications (apps) and a long-term impact on informing future development of eHealth interventions and tools among chronic disease populations.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore experiences of sick-listed persons of not returning to work during a six-year period after participation in an extensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme. Participants: The study comprised ten participants with musculoskeletal disorders, mainly neck and back pain. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted and analysed by manifest content analysis. Results: This led to identification of three primary categories and six sub-categories, which described the participants' experiences of barriers to and possibilities of returning to work, and indicated what strategies they used to cope with everyday life. The participants described that the main barriers to returning to work were pain and somatic symptoms, fatigue, and not fulfilling the work requirements. Participants considered physical activity a key factor in coping with pain. Most participants thought that they had residual work ability, and could utilise this if they could get a modified job adapted to their own capacity. Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of utilising residual working ability at workplaces. Finding flexible work possibilities requires an understanding and supportive attitude on the part of both the employer and the social insurance office.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) has become a significant problem due to high healthcare utilization, rising costs of care and perceived limitations of effectiveness of many current treatments. Systematic reviews have repeatedly concluded that, on average across participants, exercise for NSCLBP appears effective in decreasing pain and improving function. Not all people with NSCLBP benefit from exercise programs and it would assist care-providers and care-seekers if factors that impact on program effectiveness and success were identified. METHODS AND DESIGN: The study will be a randomised controlled trial comparing an exercise rehabilitation program informed by a participant preferences questionnaire compared to a program without this guideline for patients with chronic low back pain. A sample of 150 patients will be recruited in Melbourne, Australia through community-based healthcare clinics that provide supervised exercise rehabilitation programs for people with non-specific chronic low back pain. Clinicians will be randomly assigned to exercise preferences questionnaire or no questionnaire and participants will be allocated in a concealed manner. A qualitative focus group study of exercise instructor feedback about the exercise preferences instrument will be embedded in the research design. Two qualitative focus group studies will also be conducted for participants in the intervention and the control groups to obtain feedback about participants' experiences of the two types of exercise programs. The primary outcomes will be functional ability, pain, fear avoidance, exercise adherence. DISCUSSION: This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of individualised exercise prescription compared to usual exercise prescription for NSCLP and, using feedback following the trial, refine the exercise preferences questionnaire.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate how physiotherapists prescribe execise for people with non-specific chronic low back pain in the absence of definitive or differential diagnoses. DESIGN: Four guided focus groups were conducted to gather the views of physiotherapists working in primary care. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Twenty-three primary care physiotherapists from metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, were identified from professional organization member lists and publicly available records. They were recruited via email and assembled for focus groups based on eligibility, availability and location. MAIN MEASURES: Discussions were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and analysed for themes by three independent researchers. RESULTS: The 'dilemma created by diagnostic uncertainty' emerged as a significant overarching theme with the following subthemes. Physiotherapists: (1) perceive that care-seekers want a clear diagnosis, (2) are challenged by diagnostic uncertainty, (3) are critical when patients fail to improve, (4) feel unprepared by traditional education models and (5) seek support from experienced colleagues. Physiotherapists report needing to: (1) educate care-seekers about their injury/diagnosis, despite diagnostic uncertainty, and (2)observe rapid health outcome improvements. They exhibit potentially negative behaviours, including blame attribution, when this does not occur. CONCLUSIONS: Physiotherapists appear under-prepared for the challenges of working with people with chronic conditions. Quality research is warranted to determine best practice in supporting practitioners in the development of suitable therapeutic behaviours to deal with this challenging patient interface.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate young people's experiences of persistent musculoskeletal pain, including care needs and current service gaps as well as perceptions about the role of digital technologies to support their co-care. METHODS: A qualitative study employing two independent data collection modes: in-depth individual semistructured interviews and focus groups. SETTING: Community settings throughout Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were included if they had experienced persistent musculoskeletal pain of >3-month duration with an average of >=3 on the visual analogue scale over the preceding 3 months, including non-specific conditions (eg, low back pain) and specific conditions (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other systemic arthritides), with/without pre-existing or current diagnosed mental health conditions. 23 young people (87.0% women; mean (SD) age: 20.8 (2.4) years) from across 6 Australian jurisdictions participated. Almost two-thirds of participants with persistent musculoskeletal pain reported comorbid mental health conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inductive and deductive approaches to analyse and derive key themes from verbatim transcripts. RESULTS: Participants described their daily experiences of living with persistent musculoskeletal pain, their fears and the challenges imposed by the invisibility of pain, and the two-way relationship between their pain and mental well-being. A lack of relevant and accessible information and resources tailored to young people's unique needs, integrated and youth-relevant healthcare services and adequately skilled healthcare practitioners were identified as key care gaps. Participants strongly advocated for the use of digital technologies to improve access to age-appropriate resources and support for co-care. CONCLUSIONS: Young people living with persistent musculoskeletal pain described the absence of age-appropriate pain services and clearly articulated their perceptions on the role of, and opportunities provided by, digital technologies to connect with and support improved pain healthcare. Innovative and digitally-enabled models of pain care are likely to be helpful for this group.

AB  - This paper presents an in-depth, idiographic study illustrating how chronic benign low back pain may have a serious debilitating impact on the sufferer's sense of self. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six patients and the resultant transcripts subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis. The analysis points to the powerful ways in which chronic pain has negative impact on patients' self and identity. This impact is made worse in the public arena. Some of the participants describe how the ensuing derogatory self image also seems to lead to their directing negative affect towards other people. The results section gives a detailed account of these processes at work. The results are then considered in relation to relevant constructs in the extant literature, including work on illness and identity, shame and acceptance.

AB  - Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) is a qualitative approach which aims to provide detailed examinations of personal lived experience. It produces an account of lived experience in its own terms rather than one prescribed by pre-existing theoretical preconceptions and it recognises that this is an interpretative endeavour as humans are sense-making organisms. It is explicitly idiographic in its commitment to examining the detailed experience of each case in turn, prior to the move to more general claims. IPA is a particularly useful methodology for examining topics which are complex, ambiguous and emotionally laden. Pain is a prime exemplar of such a phenomenon: elusive, involving complex psycho-somatic interactions and difficult to articulate. In addition to the 1998 article, published in this Special Issue, two further papers are suggested that the interested reader might wish to look out for.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Syringomyelia is a rare or 'orphan' condition with the potential to cause significant disability and detrimental effects to quality of life. Syringomyelia shares similar symptoms to those common in other long-term neurological conditions, including spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. In these more prevalent conditions, physiotherapy is utilized widely and is effective in optimizing physical, psychological and social parameters. Therefore, we theorized that physiotherapy might be transferable to, and beneficial to syringomyelia patients. As a paucity of literature exists in this area, we aimed to evaluate the existing uptake and perceived efficacy of physiotherapy. METHODS: An exploratory, mixed methodology was selected to derive sufficient qualitative data for analysis. Specifically designed questionnaires and semi-structured interviews yielded data on uptake and perceived physiotherapy efficacy. One hundred patients from a National Health Service tertiary syringomyelia service were invited to participate. RESULTS: The questionnaire and interviews were completed by 49 and 20 patients, respectively. Of the small number of patients receiving physiotherapy, the majority reported beneficial effects on pain modulation and quality of life. Stretching and hydrotherapy were deemed effective for relief of pain and stiffness. Additionally, physiotherapy was reported to provide similar benefits to surgical intervention. DISCUSSION: Syringomyelia patients report physiotherapy to provide benefits for symptom management and quality of life. Such findings suggest that established rehabilitation techniques in more common conditions may be transferable to those less prevalent. Uptake of physiotherapy was limited, seemingly because of inadequate information, knowledge and resources. To address these deficiencies, further studies should be planned investigating the effectiveness of physiotherapy modalities, such as hydrotherapy, in parallel or in conjunction with surgery and/or pharmacology. Additionally, syringomyelia could be represented alongside similar pathologies in research trials to initiate further research questions and drivers for funding.

AB  - AIM: To discuss the methodological and epistemological challenges experienced when conducting a longitudinal interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) of patients' experiences of chronic low back pain (CLBP). BACKGROUND: The author draws on experiences of managing interpretive analysis while undertaking an IPA of patients with CLBP for more than two years. DATA SOURCES: Semi-structured interviews were conducted at three points in time from a purposeful sample of ten patients. REVIEW METHOD: There was a recognition that prolonged contact between researcher and participant increases the challenges related to minimising bias and managing researcher emotionality and empathy. DISCUSSION: Two main challenges are discussed: the usefulness of 'bracketing' in longitudinal qualitative research and maintaining an inductive approach; and consideration of the emotionality of interviewing and the role of empathy. CONCLUSION: A longitudinal design adds potential analytical pitfalls, including a priori theorising and emotional involvement. Interpretative and emotional safeguarding included reflection and reflexivity, an iterative approach and the role of phenomenological strategies such as the hermeneutic circle. The efficacy of these is discussed, along with the ambiguity surrounding concepts such as bracketing. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH/PRACTICE: Although the topics discussed relate specifically to this methodology and a particular research project sample, they are applicable to qualitative research designs in similar populations.

AB  - It is important to recognize inflammatory back pain (IBP) for an early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) has recently published new criteria set for diagnosing IBP. In the present study, we evaluated the performance of the new ASAS IBP criteria and to compare the performance of IBP criteria sets in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) patients with and without radiographic sacroiliitis. The study sample included a total of 274 patients with a diagnosis of axSpA and 50 patients with a diagnosis of chronic (>3 months) mechanical back pain (MBP). A face-to-face interview by using a standardized questionnaire addressing all the components of IBP was performed. Data about HLA-B27 status and C-reactive protein levels were obtained from the patients' charts. There were significantly more male patients (P < 0.001) in the AS group (68.6 %) than in the non-radiographic axSpA group (29.6 %) and also than in the MBP group (37.5 %). Among the criteria sets, the Calin criteria showed the best sensitivity (91.2 %), and the Berlin criteria showed the best specificity (82.4 %) in differentiation of IBP from MBP. If the morning stiffness item of the Calin criteria was defined as lasting >30 min (Calin 30), the specificity improved (72.9 %), but at a price of loss in sensitivity (82.4 %). In this study, new ASAS criteria for IBP performed almost as good as but not better than the existing criteria sets. Performances of the criteria sets were quite comparable in the differentiation of IBP from MBP in patients with and without radiographic sacroiliitis.

AB  - Purpose In order to support people with low back pain (LBP) to stay at work, work arrangements are regarded important. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a workplace intervention using a participatory approach on work disability of workers with ongoing or recurrent LBP. Methods A total of 107 workers with LBP, with duration of pain for at least two consecutive weeks or recurrent pain of any duration during the last year, were randomized either to the intervention (n = 51) or control group (n = 56). The intervention included arrangements at the workplace, along with individual guidance provided by an occupational physiotherapist (OPT). The randomized intervention study used standard counselling and guidance by an OPT without workplace intervention as a comparison. Surveys were completed at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after baseline. Results There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups on the primary outcome measure, i.e. self-assessed work ability. We found no between-group differences in perceived health, self-assessed work productivity, number of sickness absence days and severity of back pain. However, there were significant positive within-group changes in the intervention group in the intensity of LBP, perceived health and the number of sickness absence days due to LBP. Conclusion Workplace arrangements are feasible using participatory ergonomics, but more quantitative and qualitative research is needed on its utilization and effectiveness among workers with LBP.

AB  - New research is providing health care professionals with evidence for the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation as an intervention for older adults. Recent studies have provided evidence that meditation results in observable changes in brain structure related to memory, sense of self, empathy, and stress. Health care professionals should consider mindfulness training as a helpful intervention for older adults with problems such as depression, anxiety, chronic pain, loneliness, and caregiver burden.

AB  - Aims: The purpose of this research is to help health-care professionals (HCPs) consider how hope is promoted and challenged during the rehabilitation of patients who have had a stroke or spinal cord injury (SCI). Background: Stroke and SCI are two chronic neurological conditions that require significant neurological rehabilitation. During the process of neurological rehabilitation, several internal, external or environmental factors can influence a patient's hope. While research has identified the importance of hope, it has not explicitly identified which factors influence patients' hope. Neither has existing research provided an evidence-based understanding of how health professionals can use strategies to help maintain patients' feelings of hope during rehabilitation. Methods: A qualitative narrative review was undertaken. Following a systematic search, 17 qualitative articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis was used to enable information to emerge regarding the strategies that promote hope and the factors that challenge hope. Results: The results included five hope-generating factors and four factors that challenged hope. Conclusions: This article identified several factors that influenced the hope of patients who have had a stroke or SCI. Hope is influenced by personal, social and situational factors, and many of these factors can have both positive and negative effects. Therefore, HCPs need to understand how to implement these ideas effectively. The current findings consider this.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a body of literature that indicates that physical exercise interventions, with a primary focus on improvement of functioning instead of pain relief, might be effective to stimulate return to work and improve function in workers who are absent from work due to low back pain (LBP). Successful application and implementation of these interventions however, depends on multiple factors that need to be addressed carefully in clinical practice as well as research. METHODS: Descriptive literature review, to identify an overview of current knowledge with respect to the safety, content- and context-related aspects of physical exercise interventions, issues relating to timing, the influence of treatment confidence and patient expectations, and the process of changing provider and employer behavior. RESULTS: Physical exercises are not associated with an increased risk for recurrences. The effects of interventions may vary depending on content-related factors (i.e., type of exercises, dosage, frequency, skills of the healthcare providers, etc.) and contextual factors (i.e., treatment setting, compensation system, etc.). Treatment confidence and patients' expectations also significantly influence outcomes of physical exercise interventions. Timing is also important; interventions targeting return to work, applied during the acute phase of work absenteeism, compete with a high rate of spontaneous recovery and may therefore be inefficient. CONCLUSIONS: Despite numerous studies, more quantitative and qualitative investigations are needed to further clarify the requirements for a successful application and implementation of physical exercise interventions for disabled workers with low back pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Today immersive environments such as Virtual Reality (VR) offer new opportunities for serious gaming in exercise therapy and psychoeducation. Chronic back pain (CBP) patients could benefit from exergames in VR. The requirements in older CBP patients for a VR pain therapy have not yet been determined in studies. The aim of the study was to perform a requirements analysis for the user group of geriatric patients with CBP for a VR exergame. The objective was to find out the expectations, desires, preferences and barriers in order to collect them as requirements for this vulnerable group and to determine frameworks of therapy by physiotherapists and psychotherapists. METHODS: We conducted a requirements analysis through semi-structured interviews with 10 elderly participants with CBP. Furthermore, two focus groups were conducted with three physiotherapists and two psychotherapists to determine frameworks of therapy programs for the target group. The qualitative data were transcribed and examined through a structuring content analysis. Subsequently, the results of the analysis were prioritized by all participants of the study. RESULTS: The results of the requirements analysis indicate mandatory requirements for the overall system, hardware, software and gamification elements. The key requirements were target-group-specific applications of the VR exergame through e.g. individual briefing, user-friendly handling, inclusion of movement limitations, presentation of everyday scenarios in combination with biofeedback, age-appropriate feedback through praise and awards and a maximum exercise duration of 30 min and 15 min of relaxation. CONCLUSION: It should be possible to use the determined requirements productively to create user-friendly VR exergames that motivate elderly chronic back pain patients to perform exercises regularly. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS-ID: DRKS00015294 12.10.2018).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic shoulder pain is common after spinal cord injury (SCI) and limits community mobility. This leads to loss of independence and reduced quality of life. Evidence suggests that exercises can help reduce shoulder pain. However, cost, expertise and transport barriers frequently limit access to treatment services. The objective of this study is to develop an evidence-based, acceptable, usable and persuasive self-guided web-based exercise intervention to treat shoulder pain in people living with SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An iterative and phased person-based approach (PBA) will capture users' perspectives on usability and acceptability to develop guiding principles that will shape the design of the intervention. The intervention will be based on key elements identified through participant input and from evidence identified through systematic and narrative reviews, to ensure the intervention addresses participants' needs and increase the likelihood of uptake. The prototype will be iteratively refined through focus groups and think-aloud sessions. Review data will be synthesised drawing on systematic and narrative review conventions. Qualitative data will be analysed using conventional content analysis (planning phase) and directed content analysis (development phase) to inform intervention design and refinement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been granted by the Auckland University of Technology Ethics Committee (AUTEC) in Auckland, New Zealand. The results of the study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant national and international conferences. A summary of findings will be presented to key stakeholder groups. We will progress to a definitive trial should the findings from this intervention development study indicate the intervention is acceptable and usable.

AB  - Rationale Neck and back pain are major public health problems in Western societies and cause considerable disability and health service use. Swedish women report more severe neck and back pain compared with Swedish men. Most studies on the aetiology of gender differences in pain deal with biological mechanisms, and less with the role of psychological and sociocultural factors. 'Pain beliefs' is a sociocultural factor and can be expressed in different ways among women and men. It is important to know what pain beliefs are held by neck and back pain patients, especially when medical guidelines recommend that back pain patients stay physically active. Aim Exploring pain beliefs in relation to physical activity among neck and back pain patients consulting primary health care. Method Twelve patients (seven women, five men) consulting primary health care for an initial episode of neck or back pain were interviewed before their first appointment with a physiotherapist or general practitioner and 3 months later. The interviews covered patient experiences of neck or back pain, consequences, strategies and treatment experiences. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis from a gender perspective. Result One theme 'Fear of hurting the fragile body' was expressed by all neck or back pain patients. Five categories were identified 'The mechanical body', 'Messages about activity', 'Earlier experiences of pain and activity', 'To be a good citizen' and 'Support to be active' supported or undermined beliefs about pain and physical activity. Gender expressions occurred in the categories 'Messages about activity', 'To be a good citizen' and 'Support to be active'. Conclusions Neck or back pain patients in the study saw the body as fragile and were afraid of hurting it. Notions of gender had an impact on the given advice about activity and on how patients perceived the message about staying active.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing an effective exercise prescription process for patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) is a challenging task. Emerging research has indicated that partnership in care and shared decision making are important for people with NSCLBP and calls for further investigation into the approaches used to prescribe exercise. OBJECTIVE: To explore how shared decision making and patient partnership are addressed by physiotherapists in the process of exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP. DESIGN: A qualitative study using a philosophical hermeneutic approach. METHODS: Eight physiotherapists were each observed on three occasions undertaking their usual clinical activities (total n=24 observations). They conducted brief interviews after each observation and a later in depth semi-structured interview. Iterative hermeneutic strategies were used to interpret the texts and identify the characteristics and processes of exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP. FINDINGS: The findings revealed how physiotherapy practice often resulted in unequal possibilities for patient participation which were in turn linked to the physiotherapists' assumptions about the patients, clinical orientation, cognitive and decision making processes. Three linked themes emerged: (1) I want them to exercise, (2) which exercise? - the tension between evidence and everyday practice and (3) compliance-orientated more than concordance based. CONCLUSIONS: This research, by focusing on a patient-centred approach, makes an important contribution to the body of evidence relating to the management of NSCLBP. It challenges physiotherapists to critically appraise their approaches to the prescription of exercise therapy in order to improve outcomes for these patients.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is older adults' most common pain complaint and is associated with many physical and psychosocial consequences, which have been quantitatively examined. However, little research has qualitatively examined the experience itself of CLBP in later life. Study objective was to understand older adults' lived CLBP experience. Guided by van Manen's phenomenological method, 21 pain clinic patients aged 66 to 83 completed semistructured interviews. Under the main theme "living a life full of pain," results are reflected in four existential subthemes: (a) Corporeality: The pain is relentless and constantly monitored, (b) Temporality: To live with pain is to live by pacing day and night, (c) Relationality: Pain creates limits that can be tested or obeyed, and (d) Spatiality: Manipulating the space around me to accommodate the pain. Findings improve understanding of the patient experience of late life CLBP and highlights the importance of empathy and patient-centeredness when treating older adults.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common pain complaint among older adults. Despite its prevalence, very little research has qualitatively examined the diverse consequences of living with CLBP in later life. As part of a larger study aiming to understand the experience of CLBP among older adults, the objective of this manuscript is to understand how older adults experience CLBP and its impacts on the functioning of older adults. Guided by van Manen's phenomenological method, 23 semi-structured interviews with 21 pain clinic patients aged 66-83 were conducted. Through an iterative process assisted by NVivo 11 software, researchers used line-by-line thematic coding to identify main impacts of CLBP. Under the main theme "It has changed my whole life," results are reflected in six subthemes: (a) Pain damages sense of self; (b) trapped in a body that doesn't work anymore; (c) me, my partner, and my pain; (d) pain complicates family relationships; (e) painfully employed; and (f) feeling socially and recreationally repressed. This study improves our understanding of older pain clinic patients' experience of living with debilitating CLBP and offers direction for social work intervention in the context of multidisciplinary pain management.

AB  - Introduction  The home-based Otago Exercise Programme has been shown to increase sustained physical-activity levels in older people recruited through primary care, when supported by health professionals. The ProAct65+ trial is testing this programme using volunteer peer mentors to support behaviour change. This qualitative study explored how these peer mentors experienced their role.  Methods  Ten peer mentors from the ProAct65+ trial were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.  Results  Peer mentors reported positive experiences including meeting new people, watching mentees progress, developing friendships and being shown gratitude for their support. Key barriers and facilitators to the mentoring process included the home and telephone as settings for support, geography and making contact with mentees.  Conclusion  Findings from this study can help the development of peer mentor programmes in primary care for older people. Future programmes should recruit peer mentors who are local to where mentoring is needed to reduce travel difficulties.

AB  - Background\r\nNo standard definition exists for the concept “persistent pain self-management” or how it should be defined in relation to older adults. Poorly defined concepts can result in misunderstandings in the clinical setting and can hinder research through difficulties identifying or measuring the concept.\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nTo ascertain attributes, referents, antecedents, and consequences of the concept older adults\u0027 persistent pain self-management and develop a theoretical definition.\r\n\r\nDesign\r\nRodgers evolutionary model of concept analysis was used to systematically analyze articles from the academic and grey literature (N = 45). Data were extracted using standardized extraction forms and analyzed using thematic analysis.\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThis concept was discussed in three ways: as an intervention, in reference to everyday behaviors, and as an outcome. Five defining attributes were identified: multidimensional process, personal development, active individuals, symptom response, and symptom control. Patients\u0027 perceived need and ability to manage pain with support from others is necessary for pain self-management to occur. Numerous physical, psychological, and social health consequences were identified. A theoretical definition is discussed.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nOur findings have clarified existing use and understanding regarding the concept of older adults\u0027 persistent pain self-management. We have identified three areas for future development: refinement of the attributes of this concept within the context of older adults, an exploration of how providers can overcome difficulties supporting older adults\u0027 persistent pain self-management, and a clarification of the overall theoretical framework of older adults\u0027 persistent pain self-management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the most common chronic pain condition and is associated with clinical, economic, social, and public health impacts. The effect of CLBP on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is significant. The symptoms and impacts most often associated with CLBP include pain and disability; patients most affected are often crippled by the condition. CLBP also affects patients' mental, physical, and psychosocial well-being. A variety of self-report measures have been developed for the assessment of CLBP, such as the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ); however, existing measures may not meet current regulatory expectation for the development, documentation, and use of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, 2009). OBJECTIVES: This report describes the qualitative development of the Chronic Low Back Pain Impact Questionnaire (CLBP-IQ), created for use in clinical trials. METHODS: A total of 22 CLBP patients recruited by clinicians participated in concept elicitation interviews to identify target measurement concepts. An instrument development team generated the instructions, items, and response options guided by patient input. Cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted with 21 patients recruited by the same clinicians who recruited for concept elicitation interviews. During cognitive interviews, a draft instrument composed of 28 items was presented to individuals with CLBP to evaluate its readability and comprehensiveness. All research activities were conducted in the US. RESULTS: During concept elicitation interviews, participants reported a variety of physical, emotional, and social impacts associated with CLBP. Participants also reported CLBP impacts on sleep, energy, daily activities, work, household activities, leisure activities, cognition, self-care, and sex life. Impacts deemed simple, important, and relevant to CLBP patients became targets of measurement for the CLBP-IQ. During cognitive debriefing, seventeen items were interpreted as intended by at least 90 % of participants, and no items were interpreted incorrectly by more than five patients (24 %). Additionally, seventeen items were experienced by at least 90 % of participants, and no single item was experienced by less than 67 % of participants (n = 14). CONCLUSIONS: The CLBP-IQ was developed in accordance with current US Food and Drug Administration guidance on instrument development. Results from both concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews support the content validity of the CLBP-IQ in patients with CLBP. Future development should proceed with psychometric evaluation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptoms of preoperative anxiety and depression occur in approximately one-third of patients with chronic back pain undergoing surgery. In the last 2 decades, several studies have established that preoperative anxiety and depression are important outcome predictors of greater pain and physical impairments, and lower health-related quality of life in patients undergoing spine surgery. To accommodate symptoms of anxiety and depression and thereby better surgical outcomes, we need to identify factors associated with these symptoms. PURPOSE: We aimed to identify factors associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression in adults both before and after undergoing spinal surgery. STUDY DESIGN: An integrative literature review was carried out. METHODS: The independent charity Helsefonden supported this literature review by contributing $45,000 to remunerate a dedicated investigator. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science. A three-step selection and assessment process was conducted; titles and abstracts of 1,124 articles were skimmed for relevance and of these, 53 articles were found to be of relevance and were read in full. Articles not meeting the inclusion criteria (n=26) were excluded. The 31 articles were critically appraised for methodological validity; 14 of these were synthesized and analyzed using a convergent qualitative design to transform both qualitative and quantitative articles into qualitative findings. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included, reporting results based on 4,833 participants, 3,017 men and 1,816 women, whose mean age was approximately 49 years. From these results, we extracted 75 individual findings, which we then divided into five categories of factors associated with anxiety and depression both before and after undergoing spine surgery: pain, information, disability, employment, and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Five categories of interacting factors that influenced symptoms of anxiety and depression both before and after surgery were identified: pain, lack of information, disability, return to work, and mental health. Information appears to have a regulating effect on anxiety and depression.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article explores the coping construct held by individuals with chronic low back pain. The research addresses two criteria identified as important for coping research: it looks at people's appraisals and responses to the specific stressor of living with chronic low back pain, and it seeks to identify what these individuals actually think and do in response to the ongoing stressor of living with chronic pain. METHOD: Fifteen people with chronic low back pain who responded to a media release participated in focus group discussions on coping with chronic pain. RESULTS: Analysis indicated the desirability, if not need, for a somatic focus, the reliance on higher order cognitive strategies for planful action, and the use of a varied repertoire of coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are discussed both in terms of adjustment to chronic illness and in relation to current pain management practices.

AB  - This paper considers occupational back injuries as they are described by injured workers, including the impact on their abilities to function in family and social roles. In this study, we interviewed people with work-related back injuries in Florida and Wisconsin. The sample was chosen from among workers who either lost more than 28 days from work or who received workers' compensation permanent partial disability benefits. Respondents indicated a wide range of limitations on family and social roles, including physical impacts that hampered respondents' ability to do household chores, to take part in raising children, and to engage in leisure activities with their spouses. Spouses and children took over family responsibilities once carried on by injured workers. The impacts of limitations resulted in a restructuring of family and social roles, relationships, and self-identities. In addition, these impacts led to depression and anger among the injured workers and to stress and strain in family relationships. Unlike the effects on work, many of these outcomes are not valued in the marketplace and, as a consequence, are less visible. They are nonetheless important and suggest that priorities based only on economic outcomes may understate the importance of preventive activities. Moreover, they suggest that attention should be focused on social structural factors such as the provision of medical services and social support to reduce the impact of chronic back pain on family members.

AB  - In this study, a sample of 30 individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) were enrolled in a 10-week risk factor targeted intervention designed to promote return to work. Participants completed measures of pain severity, pain catastrophizing, fear of movement, depression, and self-reported disability at three points in time through the course of the intervention. Results showed that most individuals with FM were agreeable to participate in the return-to-work intervention. Treatment response of individuals with FM was compared to a matched sample of individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that both groups showed comparable reductions in pain catastrophizing, depression, and fear of movement through the course of treatment. Individuals with FM were less likely than individuals with CLBP to show clinically meaningful reductions in pain severity and self-reported disability. Patients with FM were less likely to return to work (23%) than participants with CLBP (50%). The findings suggest that although individuals with FM are more treatment resistant than individuals with CLBP, a significant proportion can still benefit from participation in a rehabilitation intervention with a stated objective of return to work. Implications of the findings for the structure and content of rehabilitation interventions for FM are discussed.

AB  - <b>Introduction</b>: Chronic nonspecific lower back pain (CNSLBP) is a common musculoskeletal condition which can be a source of significant distress and disability for patients. Approaches to managing CNSLBP have been explored in healthcare literature, as has the importance of communication in physiotherapy practice. However, no previous studies have explored clinicians' experiences of communicating their understanding of this diagnosis to their patients. <b>Methods</b>: A qualitative research design, using hermeneutic phenomenological methodology, was employed. Five participants were purposively recruited for the research and data collected via semi-structured interviews. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) methods were used to analyze the data. Emergent, super-ordinate and master themes were developed to help convey the qualitative significant meanings of the lived-through experiences. <b>Findings</b>: Three master themes were identified, with each comprising two sub-themes. These were: 1) Patient-centeredness (1a. Understanding the patient; and 1b. emotional awareness and adaptability); 2) Getting patients "on board" (2a. the "selling" process; and 2b. paternalism and the clinician's perspective); and 3) Dealing with conflict and uncertainty (3a. fear of interpersonal conflict; and 3b. personal doubts and uncertainty). <b>Conclusions</b>: Personal conflicts were identified between clinicians' descriptions of their wishes to "sell" their own perspectives to patients while simultaneously wanting to demonstrate a patient-focused approach and avoid the interpersonal conflicts which arose from clashes with patients' beliefs. Building a good initial rapport, showing empathy and adapting approaches in response to perceptions of patients' reactions were perceived as strategies to help mitigate the risks of failed communication, but this was something for which participants felt unprepared by their prior training.

AB  - Purpose: This paper evaluates the long-term impact of a Canadian mass media campaign on general public beliefs about staying active when experiencing low back pain (LBP).Methods: Changes in beliefs about staying active during an episode of LBP were studied using telephone and web-based surveys. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate changes in beliefs over time and the effect of exposure to campaign messaging.Results: The percentage of survey respondents agreeing that they should stay active through LBP increased annually from 58.9 to ~72.0%. Respondents reporting exposure to campaign messaging were statistically significantly more likely to agree with staying active than respondents who did not report exposure to campaign messaging (adjusted OR, 95% CI = 1.96, 1.73-2.21).Conclusion: The mass media campaign had continued impact on public LBP beliefs over the course of 7 years. Improvements over time were associated with exposure to campaign messaging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neck and low back pain (LBP) are common in office workers. Exercise trials to reduce neck and LBP conducted in sport sector are lacking. We investigated the effectiveness of the standardised Fustra20Neck&Back exercise program for reducing pain and increasing fitness in office workers with recurrent non-specific neck and/or LBP. METHOD: Volunteers were recruited through newspaper and Facebook. The design is a multi-centre randomised, two-arm, parallel group trial across 34 fitness clubs in Finland. Eligibility was determined by structured telephone interview. Instructors were specially educated professionals. Neuromuscular exercise was individually guided twice weekly for 10 weeks. Webropol survey, and objective measurements of fitness, physical activity, and sedentary behavior were conducted at baseline, and at 3 and 12 months. Mean differences between study groups (Exercise vs Control) were analysed using a general linear mixed model according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: At least moderate intensity pain (>=40 mm) in both the neck and back was detected in 44% of participants at baseline. Exercise compliance was excellent: 92% participated 15-20 times out of 20 possible. Intensity and frequency of neck pain, and strain in neck/shoulders decreased significantly in the Exercise group compared with the Control group. No differences in LBP and strain were detected. Neck/shoulder and trunk flexibility improved, as did quality of life in terms of pain and physical functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The Fustra20Neck&Back exercise program was effective for reducing neck/shoulder pain and strain, but not LBP. Evidence-based exercise programs of sports clubs have potential to prevent persistent, disabling musculoskeletal problems.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Vertebral compression fractures (VCF) cause pain and decreased physical ability, with no known well-established treatment. The aim of this study was to illuminate the experience of living with a VCF. The results show that fear and concerns are a major part of daily life. The women's initial contact with health-care providers should focus on making them feel acknowledged by offering person-centered and tailored support. INTRODUCTION: In the past decade, osteoporotic-related fractures have become an increasingly common and costly public health problem worldwide. Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is the second most common osteoporotic fracture, and patients with VCF describe an abrupt descent into disability, with a subsequent desire to regain independence in everyday life; however, little is known of their situation. The aim of this study was to illuminate the lived experience of women with an osteoporotic VCF. METHODS: Ten women were interviewed during 2012-2013, starting with an open-ended question: could you tell me what it is like to live with a vertebral compression fracture? The verbatim transcribed interviews were analyzed using a phenomenological hermeneutical approach. RESULTS: The narrative provided descriptions of living in turmoil and chaos, unable to find stability in their life with little improvement regarding pain and physical function. Shifts from periods of constant pain to periods of fear of constant pain created a loss of confidence and an increased sense of confinement. The structural analysis revealed fear and concerns as the most prominent experience building on five themes: struggling to understand a deceiving body, breakthrough pain fueling fear, fearing a trajectory into isolation, concerns of dependency, and fearing an uncertain future. CONCLUSIONS: Until researchers find a successful prevention or medical/surgical treatment for osteoporotic VCFs, health-care providers and society abandon these women to remain in a painful and never ending story.

AB  - A pain experience is not a simple biological response to a stimulus. It is a complex interaction of biological, psychological and social factors (Melzack and Wall, 1965). Therefore, as well as using biological treatments for treating pain it may also be necessary to use other treatments, including psychological methods. Psychological treatments used for pain include distraction, relaxation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), acceptance (ACT), hypnosis, and mindfulness. Work done by the present research team has established that technological presentation of active distraction is an effective treatment for acute laboratory-induced pain (Jameson, Trevena and Swain, 2011). Distraction is perhaps the simplest of psychological methods, with little therapist skill involved in delivery. More sophisticated psychological therapies for pain include hypnosis and mindfulness training. These therapies are both cognitive coping strategies. We have chosen these two therapies for the present experiment to represent popular psychological therapies. Although these therapies have a well-known lay meaning, findings in the literature are mixed, as there is widespread terminological inconsistency (Lynn, Martin and Frauman, 1996), meaning how much treatment, for how long, by whom, and its\u0027 specific components are not consistent. Hypnosis is a brief cognitive behavioural technique, with no specific side-effects (Lynn et al, 1996; Rhue, Lynn and Kirsch, 1993), Hypnosis has long been used for its pain relieving qualities. A meta-analysis of hypnotically-induced analgesia found that hypnosis can produce moderate to large analgesic effects (Montgomery, DuHamel and Redd, 2000). These researchers also report that hypnosis is equally effective at reducing experimental and clinical pain. A later meta-analysis indicated that the method of hypnotic induction (face-to-face vs audio tape) did not lead to any significant difference in pain outcomes (Montgomery et al, 2002. A more recent review has concluded that (for children and adolescents) hypnosis is at least as effective as distraction and is more effective than control conditions at managing pain related to treatment and tests (Accardi and Milling, 2009). Conversely, mindfulness is a heightened awareness of the present moment. Mindfulness is also commonly used for the psychological treatment of chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982). Mindfulness both reduces the intensity of pain and increase mood, attention, sleep, well-being and general functioning (Baer, 2003; Morone et al, 2008; Palermo, 2009). Acceptance as a component of mindfulness has been found to be particularly useful for the management of pain (Palermo, 2009). Recent results using mindfulness for cold pressor pain found a mixed results, with one reporting a 12 minute mindfulness task not sufficient to increase tolerance time (Sharpe et al, 2009) and one using a 15 minute mindfulness task finding it was sufficient to increase pain tolerance (Liu et al, 2013). While it is not clear exactly how either hypnosis or mindfulness therapies work to control pain, one possibility is that they may both train people to focus attention. Neurocognitive models of pain would suggest that pain demands a great deal of attention (LeGrain et al, 2009), so directing attention somewhere else might be a very effective way of dealing with an acute pain experience. Hypnosis directly asks people to shift their attention while mindfulness pays some attention to the pain in a less emotional way. While mindfulness and hypnosis are both effective for the treatment of pain, the problem remains of how to efficiently and economically administer the treatments. One option is to use DVD presentation of treatment, which has been found to work in several other medical fields. For example, the DVD presentation of CBT interventions has been found to reduce intensity and duration of hot flashes (Carpenter et al, 2007). Patient information presented via DVD has also been found to be useful and acceptable in cases of heart surgery (Steffinino et al, 2007), chemotherapy (Schofield et al, 2008), joint replacement surgery (Lewis, Gunta and Wong, 2002), and post surgical pain medication (Chen, Yeh and Yang, 2005). …

AB  - Studies of incarcerates with serious mental illnesses have found elevated rates of chronic medical conditions such as asthma and diabetes, and of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis compared with general population rates. This study explored the pattern of chronic medical conditions in a sample of adult detainees in psychiatric treatment in a large urban jail to develop a clinical profile encompassing the full range of medical conditions. A total of 431 male and female detainees were sampled with certainty from admissions to a residential psychiatric treatment program (overall recruitment rate = 67%). Interviews used the World Mental Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess psychiatric and substance use disorders per DSM-IV criteria and chronic medical conditions. Latent class analysis was conducted using 17 medical conditions as class indicators, yielding a 3-class model composed of: a latent class with a high to intermediate probability of multiple medical conditions (HMC; 12.5% of the sample); an intermediate class with a lower probability of having a smaller number of medical conditions (MMC; 43.2%); and a class with a low probability of any medical condition (44.3%). Those in the HMC class were more likely to report respiratory problems, severe headaches, musculoskeletal pain, hypertension, and arthritis, have greater functional impairment, and have a higher number of co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Being older (50+ years) and female were associated with higher odds of being in the HMC or MMC classes. The policy implications for providing medical care to incarcerates with complex mixtures of medical conditions and psychiatric disorders are considered.

AB  - A 52-year-old woman presented with a 1-week history of recurrent fevers and joint pains accompanied by abdominal and low back discomfort. She has a history of hypoparathyroidism and is on calcium supplements. Physical examination revealed fever and tachycardia. The rest of the examination was normal. Laboratory tests showed newly increased transaminase activity. Serum bilirubin and prothrombin time were normal. She was admitted for evaluation of acute hepatitis. Serology for hepatitis A, B, C and HIV were negative. Her serum acetaminophen and alcohol were undetected. Abdominal imaging was normal. Cultures were sterile. Additional tests for uncommon viral hepatitis included herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. Liver biopsy revealed non-specific inflammation. Subsequently, cytomegalovirus serology showed an IgM positive and negative IgG titre. Cytomegalovirus DNA qualitative PCR was also positive. No antiviral medication was given. She continued to have intermittent daily fever but reported no associated symptoms. She was discharged 9 days after admission in stable condition per her request with the advice to follow-up in the clinic in 1 week. Her serum hepatic profile returned to normal and she reported no more episodes of fever. Repeated titres of cytomegalovirus serology showed seroconversion.

AB  - QUESTION: What are physiotherapists' perspectives on managing the cognitive, psychological and social dimensions of chronic low back pain after intensive biopsychosocial training? DESIGN: Qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews to explore physiotherapists' perceptions of their identification and treatment of the biopsychosocial dimensions of chronic low back pain after intensive Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) training. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen qualified physiotherapists from four countries who had received specific CFT training. The training involved supervised implementation of CFT in clinical practice with patients. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. An interpretive descriptive analysis was performed using a qualitative software package. RESULTS: Four main themes emerged from the data: self-reported changes in understanding and attitudes; self-reported changes in professional practice; altered scope of practice; and increased confidence and satisfaction. Participants described increased understanding of the nature of pain, the role of patient beliefs, and a new appreciation of the therapeutic alliance. Changes in practice included use of new assessments, changes in communication, and adoption of a functional approach. Since undertaking CFT training, participants described a greater awareness of their role and scope of practice as clinicians in identifying and addressing these factors. CONCLUSION: Physiotherapists expressed confidence in their capacity and skill set to manage the biopsychosocial dimensions of chronic low back pain after CFT training, and identified a clear role for including these skills within the physiotherapy profession. Despite this, further clinical trials are needed to justify the time and cost of training, so that intensive CFT training may be made more readily accessible to clinicians, which to date has not been the case.

AB  - Abstract Perceptions and experiences of chronic pain in older adults have not been fully explored. This study aimed to explore experiences and perceptions of life with chronic pain among older Japanese adults in the community. The grounded theory approach was used to identify a process model of older people\u0027s perceptions and experiences of living with chronic pain. Twenty-four people were recruited via snowball sampling. Ten participants had suffered from pain for 30 years or more. Data were collected through semistructured, individual interviews. Responses were transcribed verbatim, coded, and clustered. Categories were integrated using the constant comparison method. A core category—motivating oneself to resist being controlled by chronic pain—emerged from the analysis of experiences among participants with chronic pain. Participants alternated between two phases: losing the self in pain (phase 1) and regaining the self in pain (phase 2). Flare-up pain was commonly experienced, and immobility and suffering led older adults to adopt several strategies to live with their pain. In phase 2, older participants adopted several strategies, such as “letting sleeping dogs lie” and “cutting corners.” Their perceptions of and behaviors toward pain were often influenced by perceptions of their aging bodies. Nurses need to be aware of these conditions among older people with chronic pain and adjust their activities individually according to patient perceptions of their physical conditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Opioid abuse and overdose have increased drastically in recent years. Diversion of opioids used to treat pain, either through theft or sharing, is increasing and may contribute to this misuse. Based on these trends, we designed a study to investigate opioid storage and disposal practices of patients who were prescribed these agents in the emergency department. METHODS: A prospective cohort pilot study was conducted. All adults (aged >=18 years) with a chief complaint of either minor musculoskeletal trauma, renal colic, or acute back pain who were discharged home with an opioid prescription were eligible for inclusion; persons with chronic pain were excluded. Patients were asked to participate in two home interviews in which the research assistant viewed the storage location of the opioid prescription. Safe storage was defined as being stored in a locked container or cabinet. Safe disposal was defined as returning the drugs to a designated location or mixing unused pills with an undesirable substance, placing in a sealable container, and then in the trash. Patients self-reported disposal methods. Feasibility of study methods evaluated the ability to conduct home interviews after the ED visit. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects consented to participate; 20 patients completed both home interviews. None of the medications were safely stored. Only 1 patient disposed of the medication, yet did so improperly. CONCLUSION: This pilot study revealed widespread improper storage and disposal of opioids. The study has major implications for education for ED physicians, nurses, and residents.

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this 2 year longitudinal study was to identify the relationship between self‐care agency, lifestyle, physical condition, and frailty among community‐dwelling older people in a rural area of Japan. The participants were 133 older individuals aged 65 years or above. Data collection was conducted via face‐to‐face interviews using self‐administered questionnaires. Background information, such as age, sex, current employment status, family structure, medication use, comorbidities, and knee and lower back pain, were assessed. The definition of frailty was based on the Frailty Checklist. Self‐care agency, lifestyle habits, and locomotive syndrome were assessed using specific assessment scores. Logistic regression analysis showed that locomotive syndrome, knee and lower back pain, and stroke are risk factors for frailty. Among the factors associated with frailty, current employment, regular exercise, and self‐care agency were recognized as preventive factors of depression, decreased cognitive function, and being housebound. Our findings suggest that enhancing self‐care agency, regular exercise, and self‐management skills for chronic illness and disability may decrease the progression of frailty among older people.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with low back pain frequently demonstrate recumbent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alterations not always related to homogeneous clinical symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and quantify the statistical significance of variations of some anatomical parameters of the lumbosacral spine and reveal occult disc pathologies from recumbent to upright position in patients with acute and chronic low back pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients complaining of low back pain (27 women, 30 men) underwent dynamic lumbosacral MRI with a 0.25-T tilting system (G-scan Esaote). We settled five parameters for which variations have been evaluated: lumbosacral angle, lordosis angle, L3-L4 intersomatic disc height, L3-L4 interspinous processes distance, and widest anteroposterior dural sac diameter. Images were obtained in both recumbent and upright positions. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences [one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), p = 0.0043] were found between each pair of values of parameters sampled in recumbent and upright positions. In 70 % of patients, on visual qualitative analysis only, an increment of disc protrusions and/or spondylolisthesis was found in the upright position; in three cases, in the upright position only, an interarticular pseudocyst was found. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic MRI with an open-configuration, low-field tilting MRI system is a feasible and promising tool to study degenerative pathology of the spine. Moreover, in cases of low back pain with negative MRI in the recumbent position or in patients with pain in the upright position only, tilting MRI permits visualization of occult spine and disc pathologies in patients with acute or chronic low back pain.

AB  - Chronic low back pain (CLBP) often proves resistant to treatment because there are different biological, psychological, and social factors that can affect its treatment. In this study, we explored Iranian women's beliefs regarding the cause of their LBP. Findings are based on four focus groups (N = 24 participants) with LBP patients. Participants articulated their causation beliefs (Explanatory Models) about low back pain through three themes: idioms of distress: stress in women's lives; lack of knowledge resulted in high-risk behaviors; and organic/biomedical. Given the difficultly regarding diagnosis and treatment of CLBP, understanding patients' health beliefs, causation beliefs, and experiences are warranted.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate effectiveness of mindfulness by bibliotherapy on disability, distress, perceived pain and mindfulness in women with tension headaches and migraines. Primary headaches have been of great interest to mental health researchers because of the high prevalence, as well as significant disability and distress in the affected people. Despite the promising results of in-person treatment and some limitations that such interventions may cause, patients may be encountered with problems when using health care services. The present study is a quasi-experimental randomized design with pre-test, post-test, and control group. The study population consisted of 1396 women with migraine headache referring to headache clinic of Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran. Of these, 30 patients (including tboh experimental and control group) were selected by objective sampling method and were randomly assigned to the two groups. The experimental group, in addition to medical treatment as usual, was treated for a period of 8 sessions by Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction Internet-based Bibliotherapy, but the control group used only the medical treatment. The sample had no attritions. Data were collected by the four scales of (DASS-21), Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS), McGill\u0027s Short Form Questionnaire (MPQ-SF), and Mindfulness Inventory (MAAS). We used covariance analysis to analyze the findings in the measured scales. MBSR-IBB treatment had no significant effect on pain sensory dimension (P \u003c0.44), despite improvement of mindfulness (P \u003c0.0001). In contrast, the greatest effect was on the level of disability (P \u003c0.0001). We observed also a significant improvement in distress (P \u003c0.0001). In conclusion, in spite of the presence of headaches, the mindfulness improved the quality of life and reduced the level of mental distress. In addition, using the Internet-based bibliotherapy method, these services can be used with easier access, lower cost, and more flexibility.

AB  - For individuals with a diagnosis of chronic back pain---CBP---who have exhausted other resources, a final treatment option traditionally has been attending a back school to learn a mechanistic approach to managing and living with CBP. The success of back schools over 30 years has been mixed at best, despite numerous designs and curricula. This study attempted to change the delivery model of back schools to a new pedagogy and to broaden the perspectives addressed in the curriculum to better accommodate the complexity of CBP and identify the individual needs of the person living with CBP.The format for this qualitative study was collaborative inquiry , a form of participatory action research. The study was a case study of a group of eight participants, including the researcher, who participated in an eight-week prototype, participatory back school (PBS). The study spanned 14 weeks from entry interview to final post-treatment survey. The data focused on the experiences of the individuals and the group as a whole.The results indicated a multiple systems effect that promoted limited self-care and suggested that in light of new understandings about chronic pain, the traditional back school model may require significant restructuring. In addition to self-care skills, valuable skills were identified for future participants and facilitators who might participate in a PBS. The participants reported value in the interactive group learning process and the materials on the emotional and spiritual influences on chronic pain. Each participant struggled with compliance, despite having experienced the support and insight the new skills provided and having the resources to continue the new behaviors. Participant reflections on this failure to comply suggested a spiritual dilemma rather than a motivation or learning deficit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite robust evidence concerning self-management for some long-term conditions (LTCs), others lack research explicitly on self-management and, consequently, some patient groups may be overlooked. AIM: To undertake a rapid, systematic overview of the evidence on self-management support for LTCs to inform health-care commissioners and providers about what works, for whom, and in what contexts. METHODS: Self-management is 'the tasks . . . individuals must undertake to live with one or more chronic conditions . . . [including] . . . having the confidence to deal with medical management, role management and emotional management of their conditions'. We convened an expert workshop and identified characteristics of LTCs potentially of relevance to self-management and 14 diverse exemplar LTCs (stroke, asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, dementia, epilepsy, hypertension, inflammatory arthropathies, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, progressive neurological disorders and type 1 diabetes mellitus). For each LTC we conducted systematic overviews of systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of self-management support interventions ('quantitative meta-reviews'); and systematic overviews of systematic reviews of qualitative studies of patients' experiences relating to self-management ('qualitative meta-reviews'). We also conducted an original systematic review of implementation studies of self-management support in the LTCs. We synthesised all our data considering the different characteristics of LTCs. In parallel, we developed a taxonomy of the potential components of self-management support. RESULTS: We included 30 qualitative systematic reviews (including 515 unique studies), 102 quantitative systematic reviews (including 969 RCTs), and 61 studies in the implementation systematic review. Effective self-management support interventions are multifaceted, should be tailored to the individual, their culture and beliefs, a specific LTC and position on the disease trajectory, and underpinned by a collaborative/communicative relationship between the patient and health-care professional (HCP) within the context of a health-care organisation that actively promotes self-management. Self-management support is a complex intervention and although many components were described and trialled in the studies no single component stood out as more important than any other. Core components include (1) provision of education about the LTC, recognising the importance of understanding patients' pre-existing knowledge and beliefs about their LTC; (2) psychological strategies to support adjustment to life with a LTC; (3) strategies specifically to support adherence to treatments; (4) practical support tailored to the specific LTC, including support around activities of daily living for disabling conditions, action plans in conditions subject to marked exacerbations, intensive disease-specific training to enable self-management of specific clinical tasks; and (5) social support as appropriate. Implementation requires a whole-systems approach which intervenes at the level of the patient, the HCP and the organisation. The health-care organisation is responsible for providing the means (both training and time/material resources) to enable HCPs to implement, and patients to benefit from, self-management support, regularly evaluating self-management processes and clinical outcomes. More widely there is a societal need to address public understanding of LTCs. The lack of public story for many conditions impacted on patient help-seeking behaviour and public perceptions of need. CONCLUSIONS: Supporting self-management is inseparable from the high-quality care for LTCs. Commissioners and health-care providers should promote a culture of actively supporting self-management as a normal, expected, monitored and rewarded aspect of care. Further research is needed to understand how health service managers and staff can achieve this culture change in their health-care organisations.

AB  - Cervical disc prolapse can be accompanied by severe pain, numbness, paraesthesiae and muscle weakness. The choice lies between a conservative approach with physiotherapy and pain modulating drugs, such as gabapentin, or a more active surgical approach, ranging from nerve decompression through vertebral foraminotomy through to cervical disc replacement. We relate the experience of a medically qualified patient in having disc prolapse at three cervical levels and what it was like to experience a lonely and difficult post-surgical recovery. Despite this, the patient would still choose active surgical decompression over a non-interventional approach. The reasons for this are discussed from the patient perspective, of which there is little directly in the medical literature.

AB  - Background: With the increasing availability of Smartphones and wearable tracking devices, it is now feasible and affordable to apply such mobile devices to delivering mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and intermittent fasting (IF) to lower blood pressure, as traditional MBSR and IF incur the burden of commuting to the intervention sites for the patients. Our study will develop and scientifically evaluate an MBSR app, an IF app and an MBSR + IF app in terms of their effectiveness for lowering blood pressure. We will further explore the possible interaction effect (synergistic effect) between MBSR and IF intervention: will improved mindfulness enhance patients\u0027 adherence to the IF protocol? Methods: We will develop an MBSR app, an IF app, and an MBSR+IF app. We will then conduct an 8-week randomized controlled trial with a factorial design to evaluate the efficacy of these new apps, especially the interaction effect between MBSR and IF. Eligible individuals will be randomly assigned to Group 1 (MBSR app), Group 2 (IF app), Group 3 (MBSR + IF app) or Group 4 (usual care). Discussion: This will be the first attempt to explore the impact of mindfulness intervention on the adherence of a behavioral intervention. Nevertheless, our protocol is limited in that the effectiveness of intermittent fasting on lowering blood pressure has not been supported by large-sample randomized controlled trials. Thus if there is no significant effectiveness we cannot determine whether it is due to the intermittent fasting intervention itself or it is due to the limit of smartphone as a vehicle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic low back pain undergoing lumbar spinal fusion (LSF) are physically inactive and thereby at risk of poor health. Barriers to being physically active need to be acknowledged in post-surgical rehabilitation. The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to examine the effect of an early active intervention consisting of graded activity and pain education (GAPE) on sedentary behaviour in a population of patients undergoing LSF. The secondary objective is to examine the effect of GAPE on disability, pain, fear of movement, self-efficacy for exercise, and health-related quality of life. METHODS: The study is an RCT planned to include 144 patients undergoing LSF at 1-2 levels for low back pain caused by degeneration of the lumbar spine. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive either usual care or usual care plus GAPE. GAPE consists of nine individual physiotherapist-guided sessions over a 10-week period. The overall purpose is to reduce sedentary behaviour, by educating the patient about pain and, based on a cognitive behavioural perspective, gradually strengthen the patient's self-efficacy to be physically active and reduce fear of movement. The physiotherapist will plan the intervention in collaboration with the patient. Based on a semi-structured interview and observations of the patient in their home, they will set individually functional goals. The primary outcome will be a reduction in sedentary behaviour, measured by an accelerometer at baseline (pre-surgery) and at 3 and 12 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes will include disability, pain, fear of movement, self-efficacy for exercise, and quality of life. Secondary outcome data will be collected at baseline (pre-surgery) and at 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgery. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that, compared with the "usual care group", GAPE will primarily lead to a significant reduction in sedentary behaviour, and secondarily a reduction in disability, pain intensity, and fear of movement; further, it will increase the patient's self-efficacy for exercise and quality of life.

AB  - Lepidium meyenii (Walp.), commonly called maca, is an Andean crop belonging to the Brassicaceae family. Maca hypocotils are habitually consumed as customary food as well as traditional remedies for pathological conditions such as infertility. Moreover, the characterization of maca extracts revealed the presence of compounds that are able to modulate the nervous system. Aimed to evaluate the efficacy of L. meyenii in persistent pain, the present study analyzed the effects of a commercial root extract from maca in different animal models reproducing the most common causes of chronic painful pathologies. A qualitative characterization of this commercial extract by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analyses allowed us to confirm the presence of some macamides known as bioactive constituents of this root and the absence of the main aromatic glucosinolates. The acute oral administration of maca extract is able to reduce mechanical hypersensitivity and postural unbalance induced by the intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetate and the chronic-constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. Furthermore, L. meyenii extract reverts pain threshold alterations evoked by oxaliplatin and paclitaxel. A good safety profile in mice and rats was shown. In conclusion, the present maca extract could be considered as a therapeutic opportunity to relieve articular and neuropathic pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic pain diaries are of increasing interest to patients and physicians. The goal of the present pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of standardized telephone interviews in patients with refractory pain who had been switched to oxycodone in the setting of daily practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Once a week for 3 consecutive weeks, 33 female and male patients answered a standardized telephone interview derived from the ICF (International Classification of Functioning) about the impact of pain on their daily activities. RESULTS: After 3 weeks, complete datasets were available for 70% of all participants. With flawless technicalities, the following aspects appeared to be worth improving: non-uniform response categories, limited language choice, and handling instructions to physicians and patients. The efficacy (pain relief and improved limitations in the activities of daily living) and good tolerability of oxycodone were comparable with findings reported in clinical trials. More than 95% of patients accepted the anonymous storage of their data for quality control purposes. CONCLUSION: Standardized telephone interviews aimed at documenting the evolution of pain are feasible in a daily practice setting. They should however be simplified for user-friendliness.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: North American rural residents have higher rates of chronic disease and they report being ill more frequently compared to their urban counterparts. We recently studied health-related quality in residents living in the isolated, rural community of Bella Coola, Canada. OBJECTIVE: To assess health-related quality of life parameters in adults suffering from chronic disease and living in the rural, remote community of Bella Coola. METHODS: Design, mixed methods: (1) mailed health-related survey; (2) retrospective chart review. STUDY POPULATION: people aged 17 years and older living in the Bella Coola Valley and having a chart at the Bella Coola Medical Clinic as of September 2001 were asked to complete a detailed health-related quality of life survey during the period August to December 2001. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: demographics (age, sex, weight [BMI], ethnicity). Health-related quality of life was measured using the MOS 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the US Centers for Disease Control healthy day's items. Chronic diseases studied included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, depression/anxiety, cancer, osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthritis and chronic back/neck pain. RESULTS: Response rate to the survey was 38% (675/1770). Compared to total clinic population relatively more female (57% vs 49%), non-Aboriginal (63% vs 57%) and older people (48.9 vs 43.5 years) answered the survey. The most prevalent chronic diseases among the survey respondents were hypertension (17%), depression/anxiety (13%), hyperlipidemia (11%), chronic back/neck pain (11%), and osteoarthritis (9%). Linear regression analysis was performed for each of the SF-36 domains and CDC healthy day items. The presence of chronic disease is associated with significant differences in HRQOL item scores and the greater the number chronic diseases present the worse the HRQOL item scores. CONCLUSION: People living in the rural remote community of Bella Coola who have chronic disease experience significant impairment in their health-related quality of life. The greater the number of coexisting chronic diseases a person has, the more likely that poor HRQOL scores will be reported.

AB  - In this qualitative systematic review, we have evaluated studies of the economic effectiveness of multidisciplinary pain treatment in chronic non-malignant pain patients. Published reports were identified from a systematic search of bibliographic databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) and reference lists of retrieved reports. Fourteen reports of nine studies of patients suffering from back pain, fibromyalgia, and mixed chronic pain conditions were considered to be appropriate as economic analyses. In the selected studies, we found serious methodological problems in study designs and application of outcome measures. The quality of the cost measurements was characterized by an apparent lack of tradition using economic methodology. This review does not give an answer to whether multidisciplinary pain management in chronic pain patients is cost-effective or not. Application of standard methods of costing and outcome measurement are essential before studies of cost-effectiveness in multidisciplinary pain treatment can be used in decision-making and planning.

AB  - Background A growing body of research evidence has identified psychosocial factors to be important in the management of low back pain (LBP). Evidence suggests that healthcare professionals have a considerable influence on patients' attitudes and beliefs. Few studies have investigated how patients experiencing LBP interpret the language used by their osteopath during their consultation and the impact of language on their attitudes and beliefs of their LBP. Objectives To explore and describe how patients with acute or chronic LBP interpret the language used by student osteopaths when explaining their diagnosis, and the impact their interpretation has on their attitudes and beliefs of their LBP. Method Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of nine patients experiencing LBP who had recently attended an osteopathic teaching clinic in the UK. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and elements of grounded theory were used as a framework for data analysis. Results Participants expressed a range of interpretations in response to the language used when discussing their LBP. The use of medical words, metaphors and analogies, reassurance and the patient-practitioner relationship were identified as factors influencing the level to which participants engaged, taking an active role in their care. Conclusions The language used by student osteopaths' influences patient beliefs about LBP in a variety of ways. The current study furthers understanding of how language contributes to these beliefs, identifying ways through which communication can contribute to improved healthcare through enhancing patient engagement.

AB  - Objectives  This study evaluated the immediate effects and acceptability of a smartphone application named NeckProtector to promote neck pain self-management through stretching incorporating deep slow breathing, among smartphone users with neck pain.  Methods  One-hundred participants were recruited in the study. Participants were divided into two groups by block randomized allocation. The researchers gave the NeckProtector application to all participants for acceptability testing by navigation of the application for 20-30 minutes. Next, the treatment group (n = 50) conducted the exercise program via smartphone application for 15-20 minutes, while the control group (n = 50) rested for 20 minutes. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after intervention for pain intensity, muscle tension, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and cervical range of motion (CROM). Quantitative and qualitative feedback was then obtained by an acceptability survey and open-ended questionnaires.  Results  The immediate effects showed statistically significant improvements in pain intensity, muscle tension, PPT, and CROM in the treatment group in comparison to the control group. Participants reported a high level of acceptability through ratings on a Likert scale. The qualitative questionnaires received positive responses that the application was easy to use and the exercise program was useful to cope with neck pain.  Conclusions  NeckProtector can be an alternative treatment for neck pain self-management via smartphone application among smartphone users with neck pain. Further studies should examine the long-term effectiveness (Clinical trials registry: TCTR20160523001).

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the feasibility of a 16-week supervised heavy resistance training program with weekly undulating periodization for individuals with persistent non-specific low-back pain (LBP). METHODS: Twenty-five adults with persistent non-specific LBP participated in this mixed methods feasibility study. Participants trained a whole-body program consisting of squat, bench press, deadlift and pendlay row two times per week for 16 weeks. We assessed pain intensity, pain-related disability, pain self-efficacy and one-repetition maximum strength at baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks. Three focus group interviews were conducted at the end of the program. Linear mixed models were used to assess changes in outcomes, and the qualitative data was assessed using systematic text condensation. RESULTS: We observed clinically meaningful reductions in pain intensity after 8 and 16 weeks of training. The mean difference on the numeric pain rating scale (0-10) in the last 2 weeks from baseline to 8 weeks was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.8-3.6) and from baseline to 16 weeks 3.4 (95% CI: 2.5-4.4). In addition, there were improvements in pain-related disability (3.9, 95% CI: 2.3-5.5), pain self-efficacy (7.7, 95% CI: 5.4-10.1) and muscle strength. In the focus group interviews, participants talked about challenges regarding technique, the importance of supervision and the advantages of periodizing the training. Perceived benefits were improved pain, daily functioning, energy level and sleep, and changes in views on physical activity. CONCLUSION: Periodized resistance training with weekly undulating periodization is a feasible training method for this group of individuals with persistent non-specific LBP. A randomized clinical trial should assess the efficacy of such an intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: <b>clinicaltrials.gov</b> <b>/</b> Identifier - NCT04284982, Registered on February 24th 2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementation fidelity is poorly addressed within physical therapy interventions, which may be due to limited research on how to develop and implement an implementation fidelity protocol. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a feasible implementation fidelity protocol within a pilot study of a physical therapy-led intervention to promote self-management for people with chronic low back pain or osteoarthritis. DESIGN: A 2-phase mixed-methods design was used. METHODS: Phase 1 involved the development of an initial implementation fidelity protocol using qualitative interviews with potential stakeholders to explore the acceptability of proposed strategies to enhance and assess implementation fidelity. Phase 2 involved testing and refining the initial implementation fidelity protocol to develop a finalized implementation fidelity protocol. Specifically, the feasibility of 3 different strategies (physical therapist self-report checklists, independently rated direct observations, and audio-recorded observations) for assessing implementation fidelity of intervention delivery was tested, followed by additional stakeholder interviews that explored the overall feasibility of the implementation fidelity protocol. RESULTS: Phase 1 interviews determined the proposed implementation fidelity strategies to be acceptable to stakeholders. Phase 2 showed that independently rated audio recordings (n=6) and provider self-report checklists (n=12) were easier to implement than independently rated direct observations (n=12) for assessing implementation fidelity of intervention delivery. Good agreement (79.8%-92.8%) was found among all methods. Qualitative stakeholder interviews confirmed the acceptability, practicality, and implementation of the implementation fidelity protocol. LIMITATIONS: The reliability and validity of assessment checklists used in this study have yet to be fully tested, and blinding of independent raters was not possible. CONCLUSIONS: A feasible implementation fidelity protocol was developed based on a 2-phase development process involving intervention stakeholders. This study provides valuable information on the feasibility of rigorously addressing implementation fidelity within physical therapy interventions and provides recommendations for researchers wanting to address implementation fidelity in similar areas.

It describes the four-stage development process of the Health Assessment Project (HAP), a collaboration of the UMASS School of Public Health faculty and students, community based organizations and youth residents: (1) planning with a contemporary participatory approach, (2) implementing the data collection with traditional survey methodology, (3) tailoring the data analysis for a presentation at a community forum and report, and (4) incorporating the community's reaction to data results. In addition, it presents selected data results on health conditions of individual household members and perceived community health concerns and resources. Salient data results include high rates of chronic health conditions such as asthma and other respiratory problems among residents 0-18, back pain and other musculoskeletal among younger adults 19-54, and high blood pressure and other cardi-circulatory problems among older adults age 55 and older. The three most prevalent perceived community concerns are substance abuse, gangs and drug dealing. Identified community resources include sources of (1) providers of primary care, (2) health information as family/friends and Spanish media, (3) social activity such as churches and schools. Finally, this paper concludes by discussing implications for community health practice.

AB  - Purpose. To explore how patients with persistent unexplained pain interpret and utilise the biopsychosocial model. This might have an impact on the outcome from treatment programmes that adopts a biopsychosocial approach. Method. We conducted three interviews with 20 patients attending a pain management programme for persistent unexplained back pain; prior to attending the course, immediately following the course and at 1 year. We used the methods of grounded theory. Results. Patients battled through several dialectic tensions in an attempt to legitimise their pain: First, patients wanted a medical diagnosis but also recognised that psychosocial factors contributed to their pain. Second, although the outward appearance of pain was important to legitimacy, it was also important not to appear ‘too ill’. Third, meeting others with unexplained pain reinforced credibility, but patients also described how they were not ‘like the others’. Finally, although holding on to one's self was important, patients also described an acceptance of loss. Conclusions. These dialectic tensions are likely to have an impact on a person's decision to embrace the biopsychosocial model, and might therefore effect their outcome. Health care professionals should be sensitive to the cultural ambiguity of patients with persistent unexplained pain.

AB  - Purpose: Qualitative research can help to advance our understanding, management and prevention of work disability. Our aim was to integrate qualitative research findings in order to increase our understanding of barriers to stay in work with chronic pain.Methods: We searched five electronic bibliographic databases until September 2012, supplemented by citation tracking and hand-searching. We used meta-ethnography to synthesis our findings. Central to meta-ethnography is identifying “concepts” and developing a conceptual model. Concepts were compared and organised into categories.Results: The following categories can have an impact on the decision to remain in work: struggling to affirm myself as a good worker; balancing life and work in the face of unpredictable symptoms; my work colleagues don't believe me; the system does not facilitate return to work; the battle for legitimacy.Conclusions: Our innovation is to present an internationally relevant model based on a conceptual synthesis. This model highlights the adversarial work experience of people with chronic. The papers span 15 years of qualitative research. A significant finding is that these themes continue to pervade the current work environment for those in pain, and this has clear implications for education, social care and policy.Implications for RehabilitationPeople with chronic pain face an adversarial struggle to maintain their credibility at work.Strategies to maintain personal credibility can have an adverse effect on working lives.Changes at a systems level are needed to facilitate continuance and return to work.Cultural changes in the way that we view people with pain would help to keep people in work.

AB  - Infrared radiation (IR) is a promising complementary treatment for musculoskeletal conditions and chronic pain. By means of a systematic review, we evaluated the contribution of IR to the management of these ailments. PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched until 20 December 2021. The literature search yielded 233 relevant records. Following the screening of titles and abstracts, 42 full-texts were evaluated. As per inclusion/exclusion criteria, 13 publications were entered into the qualitative assessment. These studies described the effects of IR in humans: three studies focused on osteoarthritis, four studies on fibromyalgia, and six encompassed a wider range of diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, recovery from sports injuries, myofascial pain syndrome). Based on the findings of our systematic review, we noted a decrease in pain levels, as evaluated by the visual analog scale (VAS), in patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders treated with IR. In addition, IR use led to a decrease in Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FiQ) scores in subjects diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Nevertheless, IR has failed to facilitate muscle recovery following athletic injuries.

AB  - Background: 80% of nursing home residents have reported chronic pain, which is often accepted by older adults as part of aging. Peer support models are being used to help individuals manage their chronic conditions and overcome the challenges of limited healthcare resources. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine the effectiveness of a 12 week peer-led pain management program (PAP) for nursing home residents and (ii) to evaluate their experiences. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was used. The 12 week pain management program was provided for the experimental group. Outcomes were measured at three time points. The participants’ satisfaction and acceptance were evaluated by a semi-structured interview after the program was completed. Results: Pain self-efficacy, pain intensity, pain interference, pain knowledge, and depression levels improved after the completion of the 12 week peer-led PAP. The pain-intensity level reported at week 12 was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group. Semi-structured interviews showed that the nursing home residents were satisfied with the pain education that they received. Conclusions: The 12 week peer-led PAP appeared to improve the pain-related and psychological outcome measures in nursing home residents, and the feedback on the peer-led PAP from the nursing home residents was positive.

AB  - Pressure ulcers (PUs) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) present a persistent and costly problem. Continuing effort in developing new technologies that support selfmanaged care is an important prevention strategy. Specifically, the aims of this scoping review are to review the key concepts and factors related to self-managed prevention of PUs in individuals with SCI and appraise the technologies available to assist patients in self-management of PU prevention practices. There is broad consensus that sustaining long-term adherence to prevention regimens is a major concern. Recent literature highlights the interactions between behavioral and physiological risk factors. We identify four technology categories that support self-management: computer-based educational technologies demonstrated improved short-term gains in knowledge (2 studies), interface pressure mapping technologies demonstrated improved adherence to pressure-relief schedules up to 3 mo (5 studies), electrical stimulation confirmed improvements in tissue tolerance after 8 wk of training (3 studies), and telemedicine programs demonstrated improvements in independence and reduced hospital visits over 6 mo (2 studies). Overall, self-management technologies demonstrated low-to-moderate effectiveness in addressing a subset of risk factors. However, the effectiveness of technologies in preventing PUs is limited due to a lack of incidence reporting. In light of the key findings, we recommend developing integrated technologies that address multiple risk factors.

AB  - PURPOSE: Most working adults with low back pain (LBP) continue to work despite pain, but few studies have assessed self-management strategies in this at-work population. The purpose of this study was to identify workplace challenges and self-management strategies reported by workers remaining at work despite recurrent or persistent LBP, to be used as a framework for the development of a workplace group intervention to prevent back disability. METHOD: Workers with LBP (n = 38) participated in five focus groups, and audio recordings of sessions were analysed to assemble lists of common challenges and coping strategies. A separate analysis provided a general categorisation of major themes. RESULTS: Workplace pain challenges fell within four domains: activity interference, negative self-perceptions, interpersonal challenges and inflexibility of work. Self-management strategies consisted of modifying work activities and routines, reducing pain symptoms, using cognitive strategies and communicating pain effectively. Theme extraction identified six predominant themes: knowing your work setting, talking about pain, being prepared for a bad day, thoughts and emotions, keeping moving and finding leeway. CONCLUSIONS: To retain workers with LBP, this qualitative investigation suggests future intervention efforts should focus on worker communication and cognitions related to pain, pacing of work and employer efforts to provide leeway for altered job routines.

AB  - Adult de novo scoliosis is a chronic health condition characterised by a curvature in the ageing spine. It can cause debilitating back pain and significant visible differences. Yet there has been very limited research on the psychological effects of this condition, particularly around identity. Therefore, we undertook semi-structured interviews to explore the ways in which individuals with scoliosis understood their identity. Findings from narrative analysis highlight the ways in which individuals negotiate their identity in relation to their social roles, their ability to control their condition and things around them, the extent to which their condition is visible and the extent to which they experienced physical pain from their condition. This article concludes by highlighting the relationship between identity and scoliosis and offers practical implications and suggestions for future research.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Efficacy and safety of willow bark extract for pain reduction in patients suffering from musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) has been shown in clinical short term trials. Therefore this observational study over 6 months should evaluate patterns of treatments like mono- or combinations therapy, dosage and safety during long-term treatment under pragmatic conditions with the aqueous willow bark extract STW 33-I, (Proaktiv( R); drug-extract-ratio 16-23:1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patients were treated with STW 33-I; comedication with other NSAIDs and opioids was allowed. An extensive case report form including pain questionnaires and patient diary was used for outcome evaluation. RESULTS: Four hundred and thirty-six patients with rheumatic pain mainly due to osteoarthritis (56.2%) and back pain (59.9%) were included. During the study the mean reductions from baseline value 58.4+/-22.6-31.8+/-22.5 after 24 weeks in the pain intensity scale (VAS 0-100mm) were significant even after 3 weeks with a reduction by 26 mm (45.6% of the baseline value) at the end of the study. The relative reductions of the weekly means of the daily patient self-rated scores of the pain (6-point Likert-scales) were between 33% and 44% of the baseline values during the course of the study. We present results of subgroups according their analgetic/antiphlogistic comedication. The distribution and specification of the main adverse events and the ratings of the treatment showed a good tolerability. No relevant drug interactions were reported. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that STW 33-I can be used as a basic treatment in the long-term therapy of painful musculoskeletal disorders and that it can be combined with NSAIDs and opioids if necessary.

AB  - PURPOSE: The main aim of patient education is to maintain or improve quality of life. It is mostly focused on patients even if families might be included. The aim of this study was to explore patients' and relatives' perceptions and experiences about the role of relatives in disease management in chronic inflammatory arthritis in order to provide insight into how patient education programs might include relatives. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 patients (13 with polyarthritis; 7 with spondyloarthritis) and one of their relatives (N=40). A thematic analysis following an inductive approach was carried out using the QDA-Miner Software (inter-coder agreement 0.7). RESULTS: The analysis revealed three relevant themes. The first was their perception of relatives' general roles, which included technical skills, knowledge about the disease and interpersonal skills. The other two themes dealt with their specific relationship: the dyad relationship (including the usual relationship and in the context of the disease) and the help relationship (including practical assistance and emotional help). CONCLUSION: The results show the wide-ranging role of relatives in practical and emotional support, the complexity of patient-relative interactions regarding requests for help, their relationship and ability to share difficulties. This study gives indications about how to include relatives in TPE programs and emphasizes the importance of developing interventions for patient-relative dyads regarding the practical and emotional management of the disease, as well as interactions concerning help. Those interventions should enhance patients and relatives' quality of life.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study with nonconsecutive enrollment. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of the slump test for neuropathic pain (NeP) in those with low to moderate levels of chronic low back pain (LBP), and to determine whether accuracy of the slump test improves by adding anatomical or qualitative pain descriptors. BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain has been linked with poor outcomes, likely due to inadequate diagnosis, which precludes treatment specific for NeP. Current diagnostic approaches are time consuming or lack accuracy. METHODS: A convenience sample of 21 individuals with LBP, with or without radiating leg pain, was recruited. A standardized neurosensory examination was used to determine the reference diagnosis for NeP. Afterward, the slump test was administered to all participants. Reports of pain location and quality produced during the slump test were recorded. RESULTS: The neurosensory examination designated 11 of the 21 participants with LBP/sciatica as having NeP. The slump test displayed high sensitivity (0.91), moderate specificity (0.70), a positive likelihood ratio of 3.03, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.13. Adding the criterion of pain below the knee significantly increased specificity to 1.00 (positive likelihood ratio = 11.9). Pain-quality descriptors did not improve diagnostic accuracy. CONCLUSION: The slump test was highly sensitive in identifying NeP within the study sample. Adding a pain-location criterion improved specificity. Combining the diagnostic outcomes was very effective in identifying all those without NeP and half of those with NeP. Limitations arising from the small and narrow spectrum of participants with LBP/sciatica sampled within the study prevent application of the findings to a wider population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnosis, level 4-.

AB  - Background: There has been immense interest and debate regarding the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for chronic low back pain. Two randomised controlled trials have examined the efficacy of antibiotics for chronic low back pain with disc herniation and Modic changes, but have reported conflicting results. The aim of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in a broader patient subgroup of chronic low back pain with disc herniation and investigate whether the presence of Modic changes predicts response to antibiotic therapy.Methods: One hundred and seventy individuals with chronic low back pain will be recruited through hospital and private medical and allied health clinics; advertising in national, community and social media; and posting of flyers in community locations. They will be randomly allocated to receive either amoxicillin-clavulanate (500 mg/125 mg) twice per day for 90 days or placebo. The primary outcome measure of pain intensity will be assessed using the Low Back Pain Rating scale and a 100-mm visual analogue scale at 12 months. Secondary measures of self-reported low back disability and work absence and hindrance will also be examined, and an economic analysis will be conducted. Intention-to-treat analyses will be performed.Discussion: There is uncertainty about whether antibiotic treatment is effective for chronic low back pain and, if effective, which patient subgroup is most likely to respond. We will conduct a clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of antibiotics compared with placebo in individuals with chronic low back pain and a disc herniation. Our findings will provide high-quality evidence to assist in answering these questions.Trial Registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12615000958583 .

AB  - Study Design: Retrospective case series.Objectives: To determine the factors influencing symptom relief after uninstrumented posterolateral spinal fusion with or without decompression in adult patients with chronic back pain and previously asymptomatic low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis.Summary Of Background Data: The role of previously asymptomatic low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis in chronic adult low back pain is unclear. Operative intervention in this setting is controversial.Methods: Twenty-four consecutive adult patients with chronic low back pain and low-grade isthmic spondylolisthesis first detected during routine work-up of new onset low back pain underwent spinal fusion with or without decompression. The influence of active worker's compensation or litigation claims, radicular pain, concomitant laminectomy, age, gender, fusion to L4, intervertebral disc bulge, and pseudarthrosis were investigated.Results: All 13 patients involved in worker's compensation claims or pending litigation had fair or poor results. Nine of 11 patients without such issues had good or excellent results. Although the strong association of worker's compensation with poor results made it difficult to assess the importance of other risk factors, the data suggest that good results may be more likely in patients with radiculopathy who undergo laminectomy.Conclusions: This investigation, although limited by a number of factors including small sample size and retrospective, unblinded review, suggests that active worker's compensation and litigation issues are associated strongly with poor results of operative management for chronic low back pain in adult patients with low-grade spondylolisthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is the highest reported musculoskeletal problem worldwide. Up to 90 % of patients with low back pain have no clear explanation for the source and origin of their pain. These individuals commonly receive a diagnosis of non-specific low back pain. Patient education is a way to provide information and advice aimed at changing patients' cognition and knowledge about their chronic state through the reduction of fear of anticipatory outcomes and the resumption of normal activities. Information technology and the expedited communication processes associated with this technology can be used to deliver health care information to patients. Hence, this technology and its ability to deliver life-changing information has grown as a powerful and alternative health promotion tool. Several studies have demonstrated that websites can change and improve chronic patients' knowledge and have a positive impact on patients' attitudes and behaviors. The aim of this project is to identify chronic low back pain patients' beliefs about the origin and meaning of pain to develop a web-based educational tool using different educational formats and gamification techniques. METHODS/DESIGN: This study has a mixed-method sequential exploratory design. The participants are chronic low back pain patients between 18-65 years of age who are attending a primary care setting. For the qualitative phase, subjects will be contacted by their family physician and invited to participate in a personal semi-structured interview. The quantitative phase will be a randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be randomly allocated using a simple random sample technique. The intervention group will be provided access to the web site where they will find information related to their chronic low back pain. This information will be provided in different formats. All of this material will be based on the information obtained in the qualitative phase. The control group will follow conventional treatment provided by their family physician. DISCUSSION: The main outcome of this project is to identify chronic low back pain patients' beliefs about the origin and meaning of pain to develop a web-based educational tool using different educational formats and gamification techniques.

AB  - PURPOSE: The scope of this study is women's descriptions of symptoms experienced through persistent pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain (PPLP) as well as their strategies to cope with the condition. METHODS: This is a mixed-method study based on questionnaire responses and inductive interviews with 12 Swedish women with self-reported PLP during pregnancy 2002 partaking in a 12-year postpartum follow-up questionnaire cohort. Test of statistical differences between the interview cohort and the total cohort was performed and the interviews were analysed through inductive qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire data showed that the interview sample reported significantly more pain than the questionnaire respondents but resembled the questionnaire respondents on most other characteristics. The theme "Balancing avoidance and activity" and its sub-themes illustrate the strategies the participants used to manage their situation on a daily basis. The pain was a constant reminder that led to evaluation of pros and cons for physical, social, and mental activities as well as the search for therapies and treatments. CONCLUSIONS: For the women who participated in the interviews, living with persistent pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain caused limitations and negatively affected various and major parts of life to a far greater extent than previously known.Implications for rehabilitationPersisting pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain affects various and major parts of life, including working, physical and social activities, and psychological well-being.Rehabilitation should focus on individualized physical activities and effective coping strategies.Effort should be put into helping the patient find fulfilling explanatory reasons for the persisting pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain.

AB  - Background and aim Physicians' attitudes predict clinical decision making and treatment choices, but the association between attitudes and behaviour is complex. Treatment guidelines for non-specific low back pain (LBP) include recommendations of early assessment of psychosocial risk factors forchronic pain, patient education and reassurance. Implication of these principles is demanding, and many patients are not referred for appropriate treatments due to a lack of systematic screening of psychosocial risk factors for chronic pain. Even though health care providers recognise the need for psychosocial assessment in LBP, psychosocial issues are seldom raised in acute settings. The aim of this study is to evaluate how physicians' attitudes towards assessing psychological issues of LBP patients are associated with their treatment practice, and to assess if their clinical actions follow current treatment guidelines. Methods The study was amixed methods study of primary care physicians (n = 55) in Finland. Physicians' attitudes were measured with a psychological subscale of attitudes to back pain scales for musculoskeletal practitioners (ABS-mp). Treatment practice of LBP was evaluated by as king physicians to describe a typical LBP treatment process and by asking them to solve a LBP patient case. Members of the research team individually evaluated the degree to which psychosocial issues were taken into account in the treatment process and in the patient case answer. Qualitative and quantitative data were combined to examine the role of attitudes in the treatment of LBP. Results The attitudes of physicians were generally psychologically oriented. Physicians who addressed to psychosocial issues in their treatment practice were more psychologically oriented in their attitudes than physicians who did not consider psychosocial issues. Only 20% of physicians mentioned psychosocial issues as being a part of the LBP patient's typical treatment process, while 87% of physicians paid attention to psychosocial issues in the LBP patient case. On the level of the treatment process, radiological investigations were over-represented and pain assessment, patient information and reassurance infrequently performed when compared to LBP guidelines. Conclusions Although primary care physicians were generally psychosocially oriented in their attitudes on LBP, psychological issues were inconsistently brought up in their reported clinical behaviour. Physicians recognised the need to assess psychosocial factors. Those who were psychologically oriented in their attitudes were more inclined to take psychosocial issues into account. However on a process level, evaluation and treatment of LBP featured biomechanical principles. LBP guidelines were only partially followed. Implications Clinical behaviour of physicians in the treatment of LBP is complex and only partly explained by attitudes.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that pain disability in chronic back pain patients is closely associated with pain-related fear and avoidance. This study was aimed at replicating this finding in a sample of low back pain (LBP) patients with a new episode of sick leave. In addition, the supplemental value of problem solving in predicting pain disability was examined. It was further hypothesized that problem solving would moderate the effects of daily stress on pain disability. The results were partly as predicted. Pain-related fear, pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, daily stress, and problem solving were found to be individually related to functional disability, of which pain intensity and pain catastrophizing were the strongest predictors. Problem solving neither added predictive value regarding pain disability, nor could the moderating role of problem solving be confirmed. Surprisingly, and in disagreement with previous findings, pain intensity was found to be closely related to disability in this sample of LBP patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recovery following lumbar fusion surgery is frequently accompanied by post-operative pain, and patients often continue to experience some level of chronic pain. There is a scarcity of qualitative research focusing on patient experiences regarding lumbar fusion surgery. This study aims to clarify how lumbar fusion surgery patients experience the perioperative period; their hopes, their post-operative pain experiences, their fluctuating physical condition and accompanying emotions. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 lumbar fusion surgery patients. Transcripts of these interviews were open and axial coded by two coders using Atlas.ti software and Thematic Analysis. RESULTS: A total of thirteen categories and four overarching themes were generated from the data. Participants described their beliefs and experiences surrounding surgery, including a long preoperative illness process, tumultuous recovery and unfulfilled preoperative expectations. Participants used various forms of pain coping including activity avoidance and endurance, and emotion regulation strategies such as acceptance. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that, for lumbar fusion patients, surgery seems to be a last resort. Professionals should fulfill the patients need for information and focus on managing realistic expectations while respecting the distress and strain the illness process has on a patient, thereby potentially increasing patient satisfaction and enhancing postoperative recovery.

AB  - Objectives. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first randomized controlled\r\ntrial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a second-generation mindfulness-based\r\nintervention (SG-MBI) for treating fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Compared to firstgeneration\r\nmindfulness-based interventions, SG-MBIs are more acknowledging of the\r\nspiritual aspect of mindfulness.\r\nDesign. A RCT employing intent-to-treat analysis.\r\nMethods. Adults with FMS received an 8-week SG-MBI known as meditation awareness\r\ntraining (MAT; n = 74) or an active control intervention known as cognitive behaviour\r\ntheory for groups (n = 74). Assessments were performed at pre-, post-, and 6-month\r\nfollow-up phases.\r\nResults. Meditation awareness training participants demonstrated significant and\r\nsustained improvements over control group participants in FMS symptomatology, pain\r\nperception, sleep quality, psychological distress, non-attachment (to self, symptoms, and\r\nenvironment), and civic engagement. A mediation analysis found that (1) civic engagement\r\npartially mediated treatment effects for all outcome variables, (2) non-attachment\r\npartially mediated treatment effects for psychological distress and sleep quality, and (3)\r\nnon-attachment almost fully mediated treatment effects for FMS symptomatology and\r\npain perception. Average daily time spent in meditation was found to be a significant\r\npredictor of changes in all outcome variables.\r\nConclusions. Meditation awareness training may be a suitable treatment for adults with\r\nFMS and appears to ameliorate FMS symptomatology and pain perception by reducing\r\nattachment to self.

AB  - Objectives This Masterclass discusses findings from a growing body of qualitative research studies that have investigated the subjective experience of having persistent non-malignant low back pain. These studies have found that people with experience changes in self image, personal relationships and life roles. They have also reported on how subjectivity affects the therapeutic relationship, what patients have found helpful in dealing with healthcare professionals, and what it is like to go through a healthcare system for a pain that may not be curable or even diagnosable. The findings are of great importance for clinicians who wish to provide person centred care for patients with persistent low back pain, so this Masterclass ends with key lessons for practitioners.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of general practitioners (GP) about inflammatory back pain (IBP) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and potential barriers for referral of patients suspected of having axSpA. METHODS: A qualitative study involving semistructured interviews with GP was conducted. Transcripts of the interviews were independently read and annotated by 2 readers. Illustrative themes were identified and a coding system to categorize the data was developed. RESULTS: Ten GP (all men; mean age 49 yrs) were interviewed. All could adequately describe "classic" ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and mentioned chronic back pain and/or stiffness as key features. All GP thought that AS is almost exclusively diagnosed in men. Six GP knew that there is a difference between mechanical back pain and IBP, but could recall only a limited number of variables indicative of IBP, such as awakening night pain (4 GP), insidious onset of back pain (1 GP), improvement with movement (1 GP), and (morning) stiffness (2 GP). Two GP mentioned peripheral arthritis as other SpA features, none mentioned dactylitis or enthesitis. GP awareness of associated extraarticular manifestations was low. Most GP expressed that (practical) referral measures would be useful. CONCLUSION: GP are aware of "classic", but longterm features of axSpA. Knowledge about the disease spectrum and early detection is, however, limited. Addressing these issues in training programs may improve recognition of axSpA in primary care. This may ultimately contribute to earlier referral, diagnosis, and initiation of effective treatment in patients with axSpA.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and effectiveness of acupuncture for the management of nonspecific low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Acupuncture is one of the oldest forms of therapy, but little is known about the effectiveness of acupuncture for low back pain. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials were done to assess the effectiveness of all types of acupuncture treatment, which involves needling for subjects with nonspecific low back pain. Two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution, and journal independently assessed the methodologic quality of the studies. Because data were statistically and clinically too heterogeneous, a qualitative review was performed. The evidence was classified into four levels: strong, moderate, limited, or no evidence. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials were included. Overall, the methodologic quality was low. Only two studies met the preset "high quality" level for this review. No study clearly evaluated acupuncture for acute low back pain. The results indicate that there was no evidence showing acupuncture to be more effective than no treatment. There was moderate evidence indicating that acupuncture is not more effective than trigger-point injection or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and there was limited evidence that acupuncture is not more effective than placebo or sham acupuncture for the management of chronic low back pain. CONCLUSIONS: Because this systematic review did not clearly indicate that acupuncture is effective in the management of back pain, the authors would not recommend acupuncture as a regular treatment for patients with low back pain. There clearly is a need for more high-quality randomized controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the Swedish back school in 1980, the content of back schools has changed and appears to vary widely today. Back schools are frequently used in the treatment of low back pain patients. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of back schools for patients with non-specific low back pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Medline and Embase databases up to December 1997 and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to December 1998 if reported in English, Dutch, French or German. We also screened references given in relevant reviews and identified randomised trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised trials that reported on any type of back school for non-specific low back pain were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution and journal independently extracted the data and assessed trial quality. Our preset "high quality" level was 6 or more out of 11 internal validity criteria with positive scores. As data were statistically and clinically too heterogeneous, a qualitative review (best evidence synthesis) was performed. The evidence was classified into 4 levels (strong, moderate, limited or no evidence) taking into account the methodological quality of the studies. MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs were included in our systematic review. Overall, the methodological quality was low. Only 3 trials were considered high quality. It was not possible to make relevant subgroup analyses for radiation versus no radiation or to have a relevant subgroup of studies reporting on acute low back pain only. The results indicate that there is moderate evidence that back schools have better short-term effects than other treatments for chronic low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence that back schools in an occupational setting are more effective compared to 'placebo' or waiting list controls. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Back schools may be effective for patients with recurrent and chronic low back pain in occupational settings, but little is known about the cost-effectiveness of back schools.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic back pain (CBP) is responsible for considerable suffering across the world and is frequently associated with decreased functional capacity, quality of life, and substantial health care costs. Fear avoidance beliefs (FAB) comprise cognitions and fears about the potential for physical activities to produce pain and harm and are common among people with CBP. Collectively, research shows that FAB are frequently associated with low levels of physical activity, poorer work outcomes, and disability. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to systematically locate and synthesize the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of psychological interventions on fear avoidance beliefs and fear avoidance behavior in patients with CBP. DESIGN: A systematic literature search was conducted based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included the databases Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, Medline, and PsycINFO. RESULTS: A total of 5,052 records were identified resulting in 2,448 documents after duplicates were removed. We screened 147 studies full text. Twenty-two studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. FAB were assessed by the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia and the Avoidance Exercise Questionnaire. Interventions included cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), psychoeducation (PE), and other psychological approaches like motivational interviewing. Twelve of 22 studies demonstrated significant improvements in FAB for people with CBP who underwent a PE or CBT intervention or a different psychological approach. CONCLUSION: CBT and PE interventions are mainly used to address FAB among people with CBP. However, there is still inconsistent evidence as to which psychological interventions are most effective to treat FAB among people with CBP.

AB  - Associations between depression/anxiety and pain are well established, but its directionality is not clear. We examined the associations between temporally previous mental disorders and subsequent self-reported chronic back/neck pain onset, and investigated the variation in the strength of associations according to timing of events during the life course, and according to gender. Data were from population-based household surveys conducted in 19 countries (N = 52,095). Lifetime prevalence and age of onset of 16 mental disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and the occurrence and age of onset of back/neck pain were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Survival analyses estimated the associations between first onset of mental disorders and subsequent back/neck pain onset. All mental disorders were positively associated with back/neck pain in bivariate analyses; most (12 of 16) remained so after adjusting for psychiatric comorbidity, with a clear dose-response relationship between number of mental disorders and subsequent pain. Early-onset disorders were stronger predictors of pain; when adjusting for psychiatric comorbidity, this remained the case for depression/dysthymia. No gender differences were observed. In conclusion, individuals with mental disorder, beyond depression and anxiety, are at higher risk of developing subsequent back/neck pain, stressing the importance of early detection of mental disorders, and highlight the need of assessing back/neck pain in mental health clinical settings.Perspective: Previous mental disorders according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition are positively associated with subsequent back/neck pain onset, with a clear dose-response relationship between number of mental disorders and subsequent pain. Earlier-onset mental disorders are stronger predictors of subsequent pain onset, compared with later-onset disorders.

AB  - We examined the potential contribution of sleep quality to the relation between mindfulness and subjective vitality, a marker of physical and psychological energy. Seven components of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were investigated as potential mediators of the association between dispositional mindfulness and subjective vitality in our sample of 219 older adults. Mindfulness, sleep quality, and subjective vitality were significantly and positively associated with each other. Sleep quality partially mediated the relation between mindfulness and subjective vitality, with two components responsible for this effect: habitual sleep efficiency and sleep-related problems experienced during the daytime. Implications of the association between mindfulness and subjective vitality in older adults via sleep quality are addressed, including the potential for interventions to improve sleep quality and well-being among older adults by inclusion of mindfulness training.

AB  - The performance of 245 male conscripts with chronic low back pain (CLBP) during military service was compared with their pre-conscription performance and with that of 126 age-matched male controls without low back pain (LBP). The frequency of LBP in the conscripts with CLBP increased significantly during their service period compared to risk before service (odds ratio, 10.35; 95% confidence interval, 3.61-29.52). The same factors that induced LBP before entering service, mainly lifting and carrying, also caused LBP during military service. Of the conscripts with CLBP, 120 had experienced an accidental back injury and 125 had injured their backs during lifting or carrying before entering service. During service, back problems were caused by accidents in 88 cases and by lifting or carrying in 157 cases. The frequency of LBP injuries, measured as the need for medical consultation or treatment, increased 2.4-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.41-4.10) during the term of service. Conscripts with CLBP served significantly more frequently as ordinary soldiers than the controls. There was no difference in participation in leisure time or competitive sports activities between the two groups. The future expectations of the CLBP conscripts were pessimistic: only one-fifth believed in complete recovery, and two-fifths thought that they would need substantial outside help in the future.

OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of medical complications: Urinary tract infections (UTI) requiring intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization (severe UTI), pressure ulcers, hemorrhoids and rectal bleeding, chronic medical conditions, and hospitalizations in the past 3 years. Urinary stones, orchitis or epididymitis, pneumonia, ventilatory assistance, thromboembolism, and latex allergy since injury. Current experience with UTI, bladder and bowel incontinence, bowel program length, constipation or diarrhea, dysreflexia, and hyperhidrosis. RESULTS: Two hundred sixteen individuals were interviewed, with a mean age of injury of 14 years and a mean age at follow-up of 29 years. Most commonly experienced complications were UTI (74%), bowel incontinence (63%), pressure ulcers (44%), autonomic dysreflexia (42%), and respiratory complications (33%). Pressure ulcers were more common in men and latex allergy more common in women. Age at injury was not associated with any of the complications. Older age at interview was associated with orchitis or epididymitis, bowel incontinence, respiratory complications, thromboembolism, and chronic medical conditions; longer duration of injury was associated with these same complications, except for bowel incontinence. Greater neurologic impairment was related to UTI, severe UTI, stones, bowel incontinence, respiratory complications, autonomic dysreflexia, hyperhidrosis, latex allergy, and pressure ulcers. With the exception of latex allergy and UTI, Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores were associated with the same factors as neurologic impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Medical complications are common sequelae for adults with pediatric-onset SCI. Demographic, impairment, and functional limitation factors are associated with these complications and can be used to identify at-risk individuals.

AB  - This paper develops a prognostic approach to defining chronic back pain. Possible and probable chronic back pain were defined, respectively, by a 50% and an 80% (or greater) probability of future clinically significant back pain. We assessed whether an empirically derived chronic pain classification satisfied these validating criteria among 1213 primary care back pain patients assessed at baseline and at 1, 2 and 5 year follow-ups. From multiple measures of back pain intensity and dysfunction, Latent Transition Regression Analysis empirically identified four pain severity latent classes: no pain; mild pain; moderate pain and limitation; and severe, limiting pain. From one observation point to the next, patients were most likely to remain in the same pain severity class, but chronic pain was better characterized as a dynamic state than a static trait. Among persons with severe, limiting pain, prognostic variables (depression, diffuse pain, pain persistence) improved prediction of future severe, limiting pain. A risk score developed from pain severity and prognostic measures identified risk levels corresponding to 50 and 80% probability thresholds for predicting future clinically significant back pain. At baseline and 1 year, 6.1 and 4.4% of study patients met or exceeded the 80% risk threshold for probable chronic back pain. An additional 20.3% at baseline and 12.5% at 1 year met or exceeded the 50% risk threshold for possible chronic back pain. Defining chronic pain prospectively, by risk thresholds for future clinically significant pain, provides an empirically grounded approach to chronic pain assessment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the addition of motivational enhancement treatment (MET) to conventional physical therapy (PT) produces better outcomes than PT alone in people with chronic low back pain (LBP). DESIGN: A double-blinded, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: PT outpatient department. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N=76) with chronic LBP were randomly assigned to receive 10 sessions of either MET plus PT or PT alone. INTERVENTION: MET included motivational interviewing strategies and motivation-enhancing factors. The PT program consisted of interferential therapy and back exercises. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Motivational-enhancing factors, pain intensity, physical functions, and exercise compliance. RESULTS: The MET-plus-PT group produced significantly greater improvements than the PT group in 3 motivation-enhancing factors; proxy efficacy (P<.001), working alliance (P<.001), and treatment expectancy (P=.011). Furthermore, they performed significantly better in lifting capacity (P=.015), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey General Health subscale (P=.015), and exercise compliance (P=.002) than the PT group. A trend of a greater decrease in visual analog scale and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores also was found in the MET-plus-PT group than the PT group. CONCLUSION: The addition of MET to PT treatment can effectively enhance motivation and exercise compliance and show better improvement in physical function in patients with chronic LBP compared with PT alone.

AB  - PURPOSE: In the past, qualitative studies have focused on chronic low back pain (LBP), yet 90% of LBP is acute and episodic. The purpose of this study was to examine the broader experience (acute as well chronic) of LBP in the community. METHODS: This study was part of a Personal Project Analysis of adaptation to LBP. Participants answered an open-ended question that invited them to tell researchers about their LBP. The narratives were analysed using thematic content analysis and structure was analysed using the narrative types described in 'The Wounded Storyteller' (Frank A. The Wounded Story Teller: Body, Illness and Ethics. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; 1995). FINDINGS: Two themes were identified: (1) the challenges to the authenticity of LBP and (2) the consequences of living with LBP, which had two threads: the disruption of life due to physical limitations, and the emotional distress incurred. The narratives were solely told as chaos narratives. CONCLUSIONS: The emotional and behavioural responses of individuals with LBP and the tensions that exist between the individual and others, especially healthcare providers, is explained in the context of LBP as a moral event. Understanding the narratives as chaos narratives provides insight into ways to improve the quality of the interactions between patients and health care providers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current evidence for the effectiveness of specialist multidisciplinary programs for burdensome chronic pain and functional somatic syndromes drives the effort to improve approaches, strategies, and delivery modes. It remains unknown to what extent and in what respect serious gaming during the regular outpatient rehabilitation can contribute to health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of our study were to determine the effect of additional serious gaming on (1) physical and emotional functioning in general; (2) particular outcome domains; and (3) patient global impressions of change, general health, and functioning and to determine (4) the dependency of serious gaming effects on adherence. METHODS: We conducted a naturalistic quasi-experiment using embedded qualitative methods. The intervention group patients received an additional guided (mindfulness-based) serious gaming intervention during weeks 9-12 of a 16-week rehabilitation program at 2 sites of a Dutch rehabilitation clinic. Simultaneously, 119 control group patients followed the same program without serious gaming at 2 similar sites of the same clinic. Data consisted of 10 semistructured patient interviews and routinely collected patient self-reported outcomes. First, multivariate linear mixed modeling was used to simultaneously estimate a group effect on the outcome change between weeks 8 and 16 in 4 primary outcomes: current pain intensity, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, and psychological distress. Second, similar univariate linear mixed models were used to estimate effects on particular (unstandardized) outcomes. Third, secondary outcomes (ie, global impression of change, general health, functioning, and treatment satisfaction) were compared between the groups using independent t tests. Finally, subgroups were established according to the levels of adherence using log data. Influences of observed confounding factors were considered throughout analyses. RESULTS: Of 329 eligible patients, 156 intervention group and 119 control group patients (N=275) with mostly chronic back pain and concomitant psychosocial problems participated in this study. Of all, 119 patients played >=75% of the game. First, the standardized means across the 4 primary outcomes showed a significantly more favorable degree of change during the second part of the treatment for the intervention group than for the control group (beta=-0.119, SE=0.046, P=.009). Second, the intervention group showed a greater outcome change in depressive mood (b=-2.748, SE=1.072, P=.011) but not in "insufficiency" or concentration problems. Third, no significant group effects on secondary outcomes were found. Fourth, adherence was generally high and invariant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest a very small favorable average effect on relevant health outcomes of additional serious gaming during multidisciplinary rehabilitation. The indication that serious gaming could be a relatively time-efficient component warrants further research into if, when, how, and for which patients serious gaming could be cost-effective in treatment and why.

AB  - Chronic pain sufferers are frequently misunderstood and stigmatised. The aim of this investigation was to provide a description of the life-world of people with chronic low back pain, using the phenomenological method. Themes which emerged were that the persistent nature of chronic pain makes it particularly difficult to endure, arousing a profound fear of the future. Chronic pain causes a disruption in the relationship between the person and the body. The person is forced to function within the constraints of pain and to find ways of coping. Sufferers are unable to fulfil social roles as expected and are forced to revise their goals and activities to accommodate the pain. The distress of their experience is mediated by the ability to make sense of their condition, finding meaning in the pain itself.This study highlights the value of the phenomenological method in health psychology. Recommendations are made which may be of benefit to people with chronic pain and their families. The multidimensional nature of chronic pain is highlighted and implications for various professionals who work with chronic pain patients are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The anti-TNF inhibitor, etanercept is administered as a once or twice weekly subcutaneous injection for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Limited data from the patients' perspective are available on the use of biologics in the treatment of these chronic conditions and this evaluation was designed to collect data from patients who had been prescribed etanercept for the first time. This manuscript describes the self-reported baseline characteristics and health-related quality of life of patients prior to treatment. Follow-up data will be reported separately. METHODS: Patients throughout the United Kingdom prescribed etanercept were invited to participate in an evaluation of their condition and treatment using a data collection tool consisting of a web-based system supplemented by telephone reporting (PROBE). Outcome measures reported at baseline included demographic data, the condition being treated, previous treatment with biologic agents and current and previous medications. Questions modified from standard, validated quality of life questionnaires such as EQ-5D were incorporated and patients made a global assessment of the severity of their own illness using the CGI-S scale. RESULTS: A total of 344 patients/carers/parents participated in the evaluation at baseline, 290 (84%) by online questionnaire and 54 (16%) by telephone. Overall, the study population had a mean age of 53 years, was predominantly female (62%) and 20% had been previously treated with a biologic agent. A total of 191 (56%) patients were receiving treatment with etanercept for rheumatoid arthritis, 44 (13%) for psoriatic arthritis, 43 (13%) for ankylosing spondylitis, 35 (10%) for psoriasis, 9 (3%) for known juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and 22 (6%) for another condition/patient unsure/missing response. All patients were prescribed the 50 mg weekly dose of etanercept except for 1 patient with JIA (40 mg) dose and 2 patients with psoriasis (100 mg). Thirty-eight percent of patients with rheumatoid arthritis were not receiving treatment with methotrexate. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline characteristics and health-related quality of life of first time users of etanercept can be adequately described using self-reported patient data collected using an online questionnaire with a telephone option (PROBE).

AB  - Despite advances in psychological interventions for pediatric chronic pain, there has been little research examining mindfulness meditation for these conditions. This study presents data from a pilot clinical trial of a six-week manualized mindfulness meditation intervention offered to 20 adolescents aged 13–17 years. Measures of pain intensity, functional disability, depression and parent worry about their child’s pain were obtained at baseline and post-treatment. Results indicated no significant changes in pain or depression, however functional disability and frequency of pain functioning complaints improved with small effect sizes. Parents’ worry about child’s pain significantly decreased with a large effect size. Participants rated intervention components positively and most teens suggested that the number of sessions be increased. Three case examples illustrate mindfulness meditation effects and precautions. Mindfulness meditation shows promise as a feasible and acceptable intervention for youth with chronic pain. Future research should optimize intervention components and determine treatment efficacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many neurosurgical procedures are now performed with the patient aware in order to allow interactions between the patient and healthcare professionals. These procedures include awake brain surgery and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), lead placement for treatment of refractory chronic back and leg pain. Neurosurgical procedures under local anaesthesia require optimal intraoperative cooperation of the patient and all personnel involved in surgery. In addition to accommodating this extra source of intraoperative information all other necessary sources of data relevant to the procedure must be presented. The concept of an operating room dedicated to neurosurgical procedures performed aware and accommodating these concepts is presented, and some evidence for improvements in outcome presented, deriving from a series of patients implanted with spinal cord stimulators before and after the operating theatre was brought into service. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: In addition to the description, two videos demonstrate the facility online. Beyond this qualitative evidence, quantitative improvement in patient outcome is evidenced by the series presented: 91.3% of patients operated in the awake anaesthesia-dedicated theatre obtained adequate low back pain coverage, versus 60.0% for patients operated before (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: The concept of such an operating room is a step in improving the outcome by improving the presentation of all types of information to the operating room staff most notably in the example of aware procedures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Telephone surveys are intended to reduce attrition in longitudinal studies. For paediatric chronic pain patients, the comparability of pain-related information gathered using telephone interviews and postal surveys remain unknown. Furthermore, it remains unknown how social desirability may influence answers. METHODS: To compare data from telephone interviews and postal surveys, a randomized cross-over design with two measure points 2 weeks apart and four conditions (combinations of telephone interviews (T) and postal surveys (P): P-T, T-P, P-P, T-T) was conducted in a sample of N = 323 paediatric chronic pain patients. RESULTS: In the inter-group comparison, pain-related information did not differ between telephone interviews and postal surveys except for the information on pain location (back and extremities). Agreement measures of the intra-group comparisons suggest substantial to excellent agreements for all items and did not differ between the groups. The internal consistency of a disability scale was excellent for both assessment modes; the number of missing values did not differ. Participation rate was higher for telephone interviews compared to the postal surveys. Across both time points, attrition was lowest for the groups without a switch in assessment mode compared to the groups with a switch in assessment mode. Except for pain-related school absence, no effect of social desirability occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone interviews are a useful method to achieve a high response rate. Pain locations should be asked for separately and not in an open question when interviewing children and adolescents on the telephone. SIGNIFICANCE: Telephone interviews are a good method to achieve a high response rate and obtain valid data in studies with paediatric chronic pain patients.

AB  - Older adults, a rapidly growing population in the United States, have fewer physiological reserves and are more likely to be affected by stress, making them especially susceptible to depression symptoms. Meditation offers promising potential as an effective treatment; however, few studies have evaluated meditation interventions for this demographic. The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an iRest meditation program in older adults with depression symptoms and to collect preliminary data on its effect on depression and depression-related symptoms compared to a vacation control. The study occurred at the Institute of Noetic Sciences EarthRise Retreat Center and participants\u0027 homes. Thirty generally healthy older adults, aged 55-90, with depression symptoms were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2-day retreat of either iRest meditation training or vacation. After the retreat, participants were asked to complete 20 minutes of home practice per day for 6 weeks; this consisted of either guided meditations (iRest) or music (vacation). Data were collected pre- and post-retreat and then 6 weeks later. Measures included depression-related variables (expectancy, depression symptoms, perceived stress, resilience, pain, sleep quality, and spirituality) and biomarkers (voice stress analysis, heart rate, heart rate variability). We found the iRest intervention for older adults with depression symptoms to be feasible and acceptable. Preliminary results at 6 weeks demonstrated improvements in sleep impairment in older adults compared to the control group and promising trends in improvements in depression symptoms and pain severity.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective interventional study, problems with performance were evaluated in 101 consecutive patients with chronic low-back pain for more than 12 months, before and after participation in an outpatient-based multidisciplinary pain management program in Mansfield, United Kingdom. OBJECTIVES: To describe problems identified as most important by patients with chronic low-back pain and to evaluate the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) as a tool for measuring problem-specific outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with chronic low-back pain report difficulties with a variety of activities. The COPM permits the identification and measurement of problems of particular concern to the patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: COPM, likert-modified Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, and 5-minute walk test were administered at baseline, immediately after, and 9 months after intervention. Differences and statistical interactions were determined by nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Participants identified 60 different types of problem activity, 45 of which were identified by nine or fewer participants. Decreased walking tolerance was the most frequently identified problem (56% of participants). Improvements were observed in all outcomes following intervention. Approximately one third of participants reported improvements two or more COPM units in overall performance and satisfaction with their performance at 9 months. Higher reported performance and satisfaction were associated with greater self-efficacy. Increased reported walking performance was associated with increased observed 5-minute walk distance (R = 0.35, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic low-back pain report problems with diverse activities. The COPM provides a patient-centered outcome measure that displays good external validity and responsiveness to change when addressing the individual's goals.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chronic musculoskeletal pain and osteoarthritis can significantly limit the functional independence of individuals, and given that 25% of the population experience these problems, the socioeconomic impact is immense. Exercise and self-management have proven benefits for these conditions, but most trials tailor interventions for specific joints. Epidemiological data demonstrates that many older people with degenerative joint problems experience pain and functional difficulty in other joints, seeking further healthcare input when these present. Managing multiple joint presentations simultaneously could potentially reduce the need for repeat visits to healthcare professionals as advice is frequently the same for differing site presentations. This single-blind cluster randomised controlled trial will determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of an exercise and self-management intervention delivered to people over-50 with either hip, knee or lower back pain, compared to 'standard' GP care. A qualitative analysis will also establish the acceptability of the intervention. METHODS: 352 people with chronic degenerative musculoskeletal pain of the hip, knee or lower back will be recruited from primary care. GP surgeries will be randomised to either the intervention or control arms. Participants in the intervention arm will receive a 6-week group exercise and self-management programme facilitated by a physiotherapist in primary care. Participants allocated to the control arm will continue under 'standard' GP care. The primary outcome measure is the Dysfunction Index of the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA). ANALYSIS: Individual patient responses will be modelled using a mixed effects linear regression, allowing for the clustering effects. Resource use and related intervention costs will be estimated and broader resource use data will be collected using a version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory adapted for musculoskeletal relevance. In addition, a cost-utility analysis will be undertaken to present an estimate of the incremental cost per QALY. A qualitative analysis investigating the acceptability of the intervention to participants and healthcare professionals will also be undertaken and thematically analysed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was received from South West 4 REC, identification number 11/SW/0053. Study findings will be disseminated via conference and journal presentation; via arthritis charitable organisations; and through local GP consortia.

AB  - This pilot study assessed the role of Healing Touch (HT), an energy-based therapy, in modulating chronic neuropathic pain and the associated psychological distress from post spinal cord injury. Twelve veterans were assigned to either HT or guided progressive relaxation for six weekly home visits. The instruments selected showed sensitivity, although there was a large variation among the groups. There was a significant difference in the composite of interference on the Brief Pain Inventory (t = -2.71, p = .035). The mean score of the fatigue subscale of the Profile of Moods decreased (ns) in the HT group and in the subscale of confusion yet remained stable in the control group. The Diener Satisfaction With Life Scale showed increased well-being in the HT group and no change in the control group. Participants reported various experiences with HT sessions indicating that it may have benefit in the complex response to chronic pain.

AB  - CONTEXT: Spinal cord injury often results in chronic pain syndromes that conventional pain management is unable to resolve. Healing Touch (HT) is a biofield therapy that involves using the hands to promote healing and mediate the perception of pain by affecting the energy field of the person. The practice of HT is based on the premise that the energy field has the ability to provide valuable information about the person's physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual condition and can influence the dense matter of physical form. OBJECTIVE: This secondary analysis using case study reviews describes two different experiences of receiving a HT session for management of chronic neuropathic pain and its sequelae, utilizing energy field data and reports of participants and their HT practitioners. DESIGN: Qualitative case study approach was used. SETTING: Data were obtained from 42 HT sessions that took place within the homes of seven veterans with spinal cord injury. METHOD: Two cases involving the most common patterns of response were selected from seven cases to represent the participants' and practitioners' experiences. A descriptive qualitative approach informed the results. RESULTS: The findings indicate that a variety of experiences can exist in individuals with chronic pain due to spinal cord injury; experiences will also vary with their healing touch practitioners. There are commonalities in the perception of the practitioners in the damage to the energy field and energy centers, with individualized and consistent resolution of the field over time.

AB  - This qualitative study is a secondary analysis of comments written on survey questionnaires about pain mailed to community-dwelling persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) or amputation. Narrative comments were added by 54.1% of 797 respondents. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of those who wrote comments and to understand what was being communicated in their comments. A qualitative content analysis was used to identify the major themes, subthemes, and thematic categories in the unsolicited comments. The overarching theme was desiring dialogue with the researcher. Presenting themselves as experts on living with pain because of a chronic disabling condition, respondents described personal experiences of living with pain, coping with pain, and educating others about pain. Examining comments and narratives written in the margins of quantitative survey questionnaires can add value to and extend understanding of survey findings and implications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the self-reported reasons for participation in the clinical research of chronic low back pain and to evaluate those reasons in the context of informed consent and the concept of therapeutic misconception. This is the belief that research participation is equivalent to clinical care. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study with semistructured interviews. SETTING: Phone interviews with subjects with chronic low back pain after they completed a double-blind controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two of 60 (86%) randomized controlled trial completers. RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent had more than one reason for study participation, including the following: to contribute to research; to seek relief of pain (both short- and long-term); to try a different drug; monetary remuneration; and to have their pain taken seriously. An initial altruistic reason for participation was often followed later in the interview by reasons of personal benefit. In most cases, the single question, "why did you participate?" was insufficient to reveal these multiple reasons. "Personal benefit" had many individual meanings, framed in the context of an illness narrative of coping with chronic pain. Despite reasons of personal benefit, subjects were still able to make the distinction between research and clinical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the adequacy of informed consent requires a thorough understanding of how subjects viewed a study and their reasons for participation. Quantitative-based surveys may not capture the complexities of reasons for study participation. Reasons of personal benefit, seemingly contradictory reasons for participation, or overriding desire for relief may all affect the quality of informed consent. Yet, these issues may not automatically signal the presence of TM.

AB  - Background: Across Europe, Canada, Australia, and the United States, the prevalence of home mechanical ventilation (HMV) prevalence is 6.6-12.9 per 100,000. At-home ventilator-assisted individuals (VAIs) are often vulnerable and highly comorbid, requiring complex care. In Canada, most VAI care is provided by family, leading to poor health-related quality of life and increased caregiver burden. No supportive interventions or peer support programs are tailored to VAI caregivers. Owing to the financial, geographic, and time limitations, Web-based support delivery may especially meet VAI family caregiver needs. We have developed a peer mentor training and Web-based peer support program for VAI caregivers including information-sharing, peer-to-peer communication, and peer mentorship. Objective: Study Stage 1 aims to (1) evaluate the face and content validity of the peer mentor training program and (2) investigate participant satisfaction. Study Stage 2 aims to evaluate (1) the feasibility of participant recruitment and Web-based program delivery; (2) acceptability, usability, and satisfactoriness; (3) experiences of caregivers and peer mentors with the Web-based peer support program; and (4) effect of the Web-based peer support program on caregiver health outcomes. Methods: Study Stage 1: We will train 7 caregivers to act as peer mentors for the Web-based peer support program trial; they will complete questionnaires rating the utility of individual training sessions and the training program overall. Study Stage 2: We will recruit 30 caregiver peers for a pilot randomized controlled trial of the 12-week Web-based peer support program using a waitlist control; the program includes private chat, a public discussion forum, and weekly moderated chats. Caregiver peers will be randomized to the intervention or waitlist control group using a 1:1 ratio using Randomize.net. Both groups will complete pre- and postintervention health outcome questionnaires (ie, caregiving impact, mastery, coping, personal gain, positive affect, and depression). Caregiver peers in the intervention arm will only complete a program evaluation and will be invited to participate in an interview to provide insight into their experience. Peer mentors will be invited to participate in a Web-based focus group to provide insight into their experience as mentors. We will judge the feasibility per the number of recruitment and program delivery goals met, use analysis of covariance to compare health outcomes between intervention and control groups, and analyze qualitative data thematically. Results: Peer mentor training was completed with 5 caregivers in July 2018. To date, 2 caregivers have beta-tested the website, and the Web-based peer support program trial will commence in September 2018. Results are expected by early 2019. Conclusions: This study will result in the production and initial evaluation of a rigorously developed, evidence- and stakeholder-informed Web-based peer training and peer support program for caregivers of VAIs residing at home.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is often accepted as a "normal" part of pregnancy. Despite research suggesting that quality of life for women who are pregnant is adversely affected, most are advised to self-manage. Although the use of acupuncture for the management of persistent nonspecific low back pain has been recommended in recent UK national guidelines, its use in the management of pregnancy-related low back pain remains limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of physical therapists involved in treating women who are pregnant and have low back pain with the objective of informing the pretrial training program for a pilot randomized trial (Evaluating Acupuncture and Standard care for pregnant womEn with Back pain [EASE Back]). DESIGN: A qualitative phenomenological method with purposive sampling was used in the study. METHODS: Three focus groups and 3 individual semistructured interviews were undertaken, and an iterative exploratory thematic analysis was performed. To ensure transparency of the research process and the decisions made, an audit trail was created. RESULTS: Twenty-one physical therapists participated, and emergent issues included: a lack of experience in treating pregnancy-related complaints, mixed messages from previous acupuncture education, a mistrust of the current evidence for acupuncture safety and effectiveness, and personal and professional fear of causing harm. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that UK physical therapists are reluctant to use acupuncture in the management of pregnancy-related low back pain. The explanations for these findings include perceived lack of knowledge and confidence, as well as a pervasive professional culture of caution, particularly fears of inducing early labor and of litigation. These findings have been key to informing the content of the training program for physical therapists delivering acupuncture within the pilot EASE Back trial.

AB  - Aim. This paper reports the evaluation phase of an action research project that promoted face-down posturing of patients following vitreo-retinal surgery for macular hole to enhance patient outcomes. The evaluation phase identified areas of practice needing further development from the perspectives of those involved with the care of patients. Background. To achieve best results following surgical repair of macular hole, patients are required to posture face down for several weeks. As a consequence, patients complain of severe back and neck ache and find it difficult to persist with the posturing. Work to advance nursing practice as surgical developments occur has relevance beyond ophthalmology and the particular context of this project. Method. The first three phases of this action research - problem identification, planning and action - have been reported in another paper. Throughout the project an action research group comprising of representatives of key stakeholders were actively involved in researching and changing practice. During the evaluation phase, a qualitative methodology was chosen. Interviews with 17 members of staff from the inpatient area were carried out to elicit their perspectives on the posturing of patients. Qualitative interviews were selected to facilitate comparison with interview data from Phase 1. Data analysis ran concurrently with data collection, so that one could inform the other. Findings. Overall, nurses and healthcare support workers felt that patients were more agreeable to posturing and after surgery began to posture more quickly. Communication was still an issue in some instances, and patients having urgent as opposed to planned surgery were found to be more difficult to prepare and the psychological care of patients still posed problems for nursing staff. Conclusions. The evaluation suggests that improvements in the care of this group of patients have occurred. A 10-point plan to promote face-down posturing has been developed which will be of use to practitioners in other settings. Some aspects of practice remain less well-understood, for example, the psychological care of patients.

AB  - Self-discrepancies occur when patients' evaluations of their actual self differ from their views of who they ideally would like to be (ideal self) or feel they ought to be (ought self), or from patients' perceptions of how significant others wish they could be (ideal-other self) or ought to be (ought-other self). These self-discrepancies may be related to psychological functioning and adjustment to pain. This study sought to: 1) determine the reliability of self-discrepancy assessments in patients; 2) determine whether each of the four types of self-discrepancies (actual self vs. ideal self, actual self vs. ought self, actual self vs. ideal-other self and actual self vs. ought-other self) measure a distinct type of self-discrepancy; and, 3) examine the relationship of self-discrepancies to pain intensity, depression, and psychological distress in 93 chronic low back pain patients. A semi-structured questionnaire assessed self-discrepancies. Standardized measures were used to assess pain intensity, depression, and psychological distress. Results showed that self-discrepancies can be reliably assessed in patients with persistent pain. Furthermore, data analyses showed that patients who had large ought-other self-discrepancies reported more severe pain and higher levels of psychological distress. Patients who had large ideal self-discrepancies reported higher levels of depression and psychological distress. Taken together, these findings suggest that self-discrepancy can be reliably assessed in patients with persistent pain and demonstrate that self-discrepancies are related in meaningful ways to measures of pain, depression, and psychological distress in chronic low back pain patients. © 2004 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

AB  - The aim of this qualitative exploratory study was to investigate older adults\u0027 perceptions of having a peer to encourage their participation in resistance training. The participants were recruited from a retirement village to undergo a 6-week resistance training program. Some participants attended a center; others participated in their home. Data were collected via semistructured interviews and analyzed thematically using a six-phase framework to obtain the participants\u0027 perspectives about the peer support they received. The participants (n = 21) had divergent views about peer support, with some finding it enabling, while others did not find it helpful. Overall, the participants suggested that peer support could be beneficial if offered as a choice. Further research is needed to determine whether peer support assists in sustaining resistance training engagement among older adults when the aspect of choice is included.

AB  - Abstract The purpose of the ongoing trial is to improve care of older Veterans with chronic low back pain (CLBP, i.e., low back pain for ≥6 months on ≥ half the days). Current CLBP care is limited by being either overly spine-focused or non-specifically prescribed and both approaches frequently lead to suboptimal reduction in pain and improvement in function. Through prior studies we have laid the foundation for a patient-centered approach to care for older Veterans with CLBP in which the spine is a source of vulnerability but not the sole treatment target. The approach considers CLBP a geriatric syndrome, a final common pathway for the expression of multiple contributors rather than a disease of the spine. We describe here the rationale and design of a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of an older Veteran-centered approach to CLBP care in “Aging Back Clinics (ABCs)” compared with Usual Care (UC). Three hundred thirty Veterans age 65–89 with CLBP will be randomized to ABCs or UC and followed for 12 months after randomization. We will assess the impact of ABCs on our primary outcome of pain-associated disability with the Oswestry Disability Index at 6 and 12 months, and secondary outcomes of pain intensity, health-related quality of life, balance confidence, mobility and healthcare utilization. If shown efficacious, the approach tested in ABCs has the potential to transform the care of older adults with CLBP by improving the quality of life for millions, reducing morbidity and saving substantial healthcare costs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the outcomes and explore experiences of patients undergoing a residential combined physical and psychological programme (CPPP) for chronic low back pain. DESIGN: A longitudinal observational cohort design, with a parallel qualitative design using semistructured interviews. SETTING: Residential, multimodal rehabilitation. PARTICIPANTS: 136 adults (62 male/74 female) referred to the CPPP, 100 (44 male/56 female) of whom completed the programme, during the term of the study. Ten (2 male/8 female) participated in the qualitative evaluation. INTERVENTION: A 3-week residential CPPP. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were the STarT Back screening tool score; pain intensity-11-point Numerical Rating Scale; function-Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); health status/quality of life-EQ-5D-5L EuroQol five-Dimension-five level; anxiety-Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7; depression-Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Secondary outcome measures were the Global Subjective Outcome Scale; National Health Service Friends and Family Test;. RESULTS: At discharge, 6 and 12 months follow ups, there were improvements from baseline that were greater than minimum clinically important differences in each of the outcomes (with the sole exception of ODI at discharge). At 12 months, the majority of people considered themselves a lot better (57%) and were extremely likely (86%) to recommend the programme to a friend. The qualitative data showed praise for the residential nature of the intervention and the opportunities for interaction with peers and peer support. There were testimonies of improvements in understanding of pain and how to manage it better. Some participants said they had reduced, or stopped, medication they had been taking to manage their pain. CONCLUSIONS: Participants improved, and maintained long term, beyond minimum clinically important differences on a wide range of outcomes. Participants reported an enhanced ability to self-manage their back pain and support for the residential setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acupuncture is frequently employed to treat chronic pain syndromes or other chronic conditions. Nevertheless, there is a growing literature on adverse events (AEs) from treatments including pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade and spinal cord injury. Acupuncture is provided in almost all NHS pain clinics and by an increasing number of GP's and physiotherapists. Considering acupuncture's popularity, its safety has become an important public health issue. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the harm caused to patients through acupuncture treatments within NHS organisations. METHODS: The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) database was searched for incidents reported from 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2011. The free text fields of all reports received from all healthcare settings and specialties were searched for the keyword 'acupuncture'. All relevant incidents were reviewed to provide a qualitative theme of the harm to patients. RESULTS: 468 patient safety incidents were identified; 325 met our inclusion criteria for analysis. Adverse events reported include retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), Bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), Pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse reactions (12%). The majority (95%) of the incidents were categorised as low or no harm. CONCLUSIONS: A number of AEs are recorded after acupuncture treatments in the NHS but the majority is not severe. However, miscategorisation and under-reporting may distort the overall picture. Acupuncture practitioners should be aware of, and be prepared to manage, any significant harm from treatments.

AB  - The present study was part of a larger mixed-methods study concerning facilitators and barriers to living with chronic pain after spinal cord injury. The agreement with themes obtained in qualitative interviews were quantified in a large online survey and overarching themes were defined by factor analysis. The present study aimed to define subgroups based on cluster analysis of the overarching themes' factor scores and to compare the subgroups on pain-related variables. Three subgroups-high pain impact, moderate pain impact, and low pain impact-emerged. The high pain impact subgroup experienced severe pain with neuropathic pain characteristics; used pain medication, multiple coping strategies, and self-remedies; and considered information about pain and its management critical, but were not able to communicate well about their pain. The moderate pain impact subgroup carried on despite pain, considered pain information important, and used multiple approaches to manage their pain, but used less medication owing to concerns about side effects and addiction. The low pain impact subgroup considered information about pain, pain treatments, and communication regarding pain less important than the other subgroups did. This study suggests that treatment approaches need to be individually tailored not only to type of pain, but also to personal factors and preferences. PERSPECTIVE: People who experience significant pain impact after spinal cord injury use multiple approaches to manage their pain. Many have concerns about side effects and addiction, and consider information about pain and its management, including pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and self-remedies, a high priority. Therefore, patients' personal preferences may provide additional tailoring options for patient-centered treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Persistent neuropathic pain is a common and often severe consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI). There is a critical need to better understand how to overcome barriers and promote facilitators to optimal pain management. The present study was designed to identify, from the perspectives of persons living with SCI, their significant others, and SCI health care professionals, the barriers and facilitators to optimal pain management for intense neuropathic pain. DESIGN: Qualitative interviews. SETTING: University laboratory. SUBJECTS: People with SCI who had experienced intense neuropathic pain for a minimum of a year (N = 15), their significant others (N = 15), and SCI health care providers (N = 15). METHODS: Qualitative interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed based on grounded theory using ATLAS.ti software. RESULTS: Inadequate access to care, information, or pain management expertise were frequently perceived barriers to optimal pain management across all three groups. Another major barrier was SCI stakeholders' concerns regarding the risks of adverse effects and addiction to pain medication. Facilitators included having a better understanding of pain and available treatment options, effective patient-provider communication, resilience, and access to nonpharmacological treatment options. CONCLUSIONS: Managing intense neuropathic pain poses significant challenges after SCI. SCI stakeholders felt that accessible treatment options were limited and primarily focused on pain medications with minimal benefit but with significant risks for addiction and adverse effects. Actionable facilitators to optimal pain management after SCI include education regarding neuropathic pain and treatment options for all stakeholders, better communication regarding neuropathic pain among stakeholders, and improved patient access to nonpharmacological treatment options.

AB  - This study sought to identify distinct subgroups of chronic pain patients based on responses to the Symptom Checklist 90-revised (SCL-90R), a measure of psychological distress. Two scoring methods were used: the standard scoring that accompanies the manual, and a scoring method based upon factor scores obtained in an earlier study using low back pain patients. Two separate cluster analyses assigned patients into 2 groups: one based on standard scores and one based on factor scores. Results of this study support the hypothesis that distinct and replicable subgroups of chronic pain patients can be identified using the SCL-90R. Depending upon group membership, patients significantly differed on measures of qualitative pain and quantitative pain report, depressive symptoms, medication usage, and pain-related behaviors. This study supports the use of SCL-90R factor scoring with pain patients as greater differentiation between clusters was found for pain report and pain-related behavior when this method was used. Guidelines for clinical application of SCL-90R cluster groups is provided.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological treatments such as adalimumab (Humira<sup> R</sup>; AbbVie Ltd, Maidenhead, UK) are antibodies targeting tumour necrosis factor alpha, released from ruptured intervertebral discs, which might be useful in sciatica. Recent systematic reviews concluded that they might be effective, but that a definitive randomised controlled trial was needed. Usual care in the NHS typically includes a physiotherapy intervention. OBJECTIVES: To test whether or not injections of adalimumab plus physiotherapy are more clinically effective and cost-effective than injections of saline plus physiotherapy for patients with sciatica. DESIGN: Pragmatic, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with blinded participants and clinicians, and an outcome assessment and statistical analysis with concurrent economic evaluation and internal pilot. SETTING: Participants were referred from primary care and musculoskeletal services to outpatient physiotherapy clinics. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with persistent symptoms of sciatica of 1-6 months' duration and with moderate to high levels of disability. Eligibility was assessed by research physiotherapists according to clinical criteria for diagnosing sciatica. INTERVENTIONS: After a second eligibility check, trial participants were randomised to receive two doses of adalimumab (80 mg and then 40 mg 2 weeks later) or saline injections. Both groups were referred for a course of physiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were measured at the start, and after 6 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up. The main outcome measure was the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Other outcomes: leg pain version of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Sciatica Bothersomeness Index, EuroQol-5 Dimensions, 5-level version, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, resource use, risk of persistent disabling pain, pain trajectory based on a single question, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia and adverse effects. SAMPLE SIZE: To detect an effect size of 0.4 with 90% power, a 5% significance level for a two-tailed t-test and 80% retention rate, 332 participants would have needed to be recruited. ANALYSIS PLAN: The primary effectiveness analysis would have been linear mixed models for repeated measures to measure the effects of time and group allocation. An internal pilot study would have involved the first 50 participants recruited across all centres. The primary economic analysis would have been a cost-utility analysis. RESULTS: The internal pilot study was discontinued as a result of low recruitment after eight participants were recruited from two out of six sites. One site withdrew from the study before recruitment started, one site did not complete contract negotiations and two sites signed contracts shortly before trial closure. In the two sites that did recruit participants, recruitment was slow. This was partly because of operational issues, but also because of a low rate of uptake from potential participants. LIMITATIONS: Although large numbers of invitations were sent to potential participants, identified by retrospective searches of general practitioner (GP) records, there was a low rate of uptake. Two sites planned to recruit participants during GP consultations but opened too late to recruit any participants. CONCLUSION: The main failure was attributable to problems with contracts. Because of this we were not able to complete the internal pilot or to test all of the different methods for primary care recruitment we had planned. A trial of biological therapy in patients with sciatica still needs to be done, but would require a clearer contracting process, qualitative research to ensure that patients would be willing to participate, and simpler recruitment methods. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN14569274.

AB  - This study used a randomized control group design to investigate the impact of an assistive technology and home modification intervention on function for individuals who are aging with a disability. There were 91 participants with polio, rheumatoid arthritis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, and other impairments. Outcome data were collected at 12 and 24 months through in-home interviews using the Older Americans Resources and Services Instrument (OARS) and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and through monthly telephone contact on the hours of in-home care, hospitalizations, and acquisition of AT. The treatment group received an in-home evaluation of their equipment and home modification needs. All recommended AT and home modifications were provided and paid for in full or in part by the study. The control group received the standard community-available health care. A significant 'group by time' interaction for the FIM suggested a slower decline in function for the treatment group over 2 years. Further analyses found that the treatment group was more likely to use equipment to maintain independence vs. personal assistance. This study supports the value of assistive technology for adults aging with a disability and suggests that it be provided earlier in the aging process.

AB  - Clinical practice guidelines produced by NICE - the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence - are seen as key mechanisms to regulate and standardise UK healthcare practice, but their development is known to be problematic, and their adoption and uptake variable. Examining what a guideline or health policy means to different audiences, and how it means something to those communities, provides new insight about interpretive discourses. In this paper we present a micro-analysis of the response of healthcare professionals to publication of a single NICE guideline in 2009 which proposed a re-organisation of professional services for chronic non-specific low back pain. Adopting an interpretive approach, we seek to understand both the meaning of the guideline and the socio-political events associated with it. Drawing on archived policy documents related to the development and publication of the guideline, texts published in professional journals and on web-sites, and semi-structured interview data from professionals associated with the debate, we identify a key discourse that positions the management of chronic non-specific low back pain within physician jurisdiction. We examine the emergence of this discourse through policy-related symbolic artifacts taking the form of specific languages, objects and acts. This discourse effectively resisted and displaced the service reorganisation proposed by the guideline and, in so doing, ensured medical hegemony within practice and professional organisations concerned with the management of non-specific low back pain.

AB  - Catastrophizing about pain is related to elevated pain severity and poor adjustment among chronic pain patients, but few physiological mechanisms by which pain catastrophizing maintains and exacerbates pain have been explored. We hypothesized that resting levels of lower paraspinal muscle tension and/or lower paraspinal and cardiovascular reactivity to emotional arousal may: (a) mediate links between pain catastrophizing and chronic pain intensity; (b) moderate these links such that only patients described by certain combinations of pain catastrophizing and physiological indexes would report pronounced chronic pain. Chronic low back pain patients ( N = 97) participated in anger recall and sadness recall interviews while lower paraspinal and trapezius EMG and systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Mediation models were not supported. However, pain catastrophizing significantly interacted with resting lower paraspinal muscle tension to predict pain severity such that high catastrophizers with high resting lower paraspinal tension reported the greatest pain. Pain catastrophizing also interacted with SBP, DBP and HR reactivity to affect pain such that high catastrophizers who showed low cardiovascular reactivity to the interviews reported the greatest pain. Results support a multi-variable profile approach to identifying pain catastrophizers at greatest risk for pain severity by virtue of resting muscle tension and cardiovascular stress function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess second-year medical students' views on chiropractic. METHODS: A three-step triangulation approach was designed, comprising a 53-item survey, nine key informant interviews and one focus group of 8 subjects. ANOVA was used to assess attitude-response survey totals over grouping variables. Constant comparison method and NVivo was used for thematic analysis. RESULTS: 112 medical students completed the survey (50% response rate). Subjects reporting no previous chiropractic experience/exposure or interest in learning about chiropractic were significantly more attitude-negative towards chiropractic. Thematically, medical students viewed chiropractic as an increasingly evidence-based complementary therapy for low back/chronic pain, but based views on indirect sources. Within formal curriculum, they wanted to learn about clinical conditions and benefits/risks related to treatment, as greater understanding was needed for future patient referrals. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the importance of exposure to chiropractic within the formal medical curriculum to help foster future collaboration between these two professions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Of various chronic diseases, low back pain (LBP) is the most common and debilitating musculoskeletal condition among older adults aged 65 years or older. While more than 17 million older adults in the USA suffer from at least one episode of LBP annually, approximately six million of them experience chronic LBP that significantly affects their quality of life and physical function. Since many older adults with chronic LBP may also have comorbidities and are more sensitive to pain than younger counterparts, these older individuals may face unique age-related physical and psychosocial problems. While some qualitative research studies have investigated the life experiences of older adults with chronic LBP, no systematic review has integrated and synthesized the scientific knowledge regarding the influence of chronic LBP on the physical, psychological, and social aspects of lives in older adults. Without such information, it may result in unmet care needs and ineffective interventions for this vulnerable group. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review is to synthesize knowledge regarding older adults' experiences of living with chronic LBP and the implications on their daily lives. METHODS/DESIGN: Candidate publications will be sought from databases: PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Qualitative research studies will be included if they are related to the experiences of older adults with chronic LBP. Two independent reviewers will screen the titles, abstracts, and full-text articles for eligibility. The reference lists of the included studies will be checked for additional relevant studies. Forward citation tracking will be conducted. Meta-ethnography will be chosen to synthesize the data from the included studies. Specifically, the second-order concepts that are deemed to be translatable by two independent reviewers will be included and synthesized to capture the core of the idiomatic translations (i.e., a translation focusing on salient categories of meaning rather than the literal translation of words or phrases). DISCUSSION: This systematic review of qualitative evidence will enable researchers to identify potential unmet care needs, as well as to facilitate the development of effective, appropriate, person-centered health care interventions targeting this group of individuals.

AB  - In this research, the utility of Folkman's meaning-based coping theory was examined using a sample of adults with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Folkman's research included caregivers of AIDS patients and found that meaning-based coping variables were related to positive but not negative psychological outcomes. These coping processes were used in an effort to find meaning in the midst of a stressful situation. This research examined the meaning-based coping variables of positive reappraisal, goal-directed problem focused coping, and religious beliefs/practices in relation to psychological and physical outcomes. The study used 118 clients seeking care at a pain clinic who were diagnosed with CLBP. Meaning-based coping variables were examined using scales from the COPE inventory. Religious practices were evaluated with the Religious Practices Questionnaire. Psychological outcomes were examined using three subscales from Ryff's Well-Being Scale and the shortened PANAS assessed both positive and negative affect. Two physical outcome scales from the SF-36 were used to assess physical outcomes. In addition, five clients were interviewed in order to elaborate on the use of coping processes in this sample. Bivariate correlations and a series of hierarchical multiple regressions were used to assess each of the outcomes. The models included, first, the significantly correlated control variables and, secondly, the meaning-based coping variables. For psychological outcomes, the model including all of the meaning-based coping variables accounted for significant variance in positive but not negative outcomes. These findings support Folkman's meaning-based coping processes as useful among clients with CLBP. The addition of meaning-based coping variables did not contribute significantly to the variance in physical functioning outcomes. This finding replicated Folkman's research findings. Interviews provided evidence that clients do use all meaning-based coping variables in addition to the coping processes of perseverance, social support, and distraction. First identified in Folkman's research, the coping process of infusing ordinary events with positive meaning was also identified in the interviews. These results indicated that Folkman's meaning-based coping theory is useful when examining psychological outcomes but not physical functioning outcomes. Additional research is required to further evaluate the use of meaning-based coping processes in adults with CLBP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several methods currently used for determining meaningful or important change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures are anchored by global transition items. It can be empirically demonstrated that patients' responses to these gold standards for change do not adequately incorporate the prior condition, yet these transition items play an influential role in patient-clinician communications and cannot be disregarded. This follow-up study queried patients to better understand how they ascertained their transition assessments. DATA SOURCE: Prior to their qualitative interviews, the 41 participants in this study had completed 1 year of enrollment in a clinical study with bi-monthly HRQoL telephone interviews that included the SF-36 and a disease-specific HRQoL instrument (asthma, COPD, or heart disease), as well as global transition assessments for each instruments domains. STUDY DESIGN: We used face-to-face cognitive interview and the think aloud approaches to obtain qualitative clues for understanding patient reports of HRQoL changes over time. Interview transcripts were coded using the four components of the Rapkin-Schwarz Appraisal Model: frame of reference; sampling strategy; standards of comparison; and combinatory algorithm. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients' explanations for determining global transition item responses often focused on current mobility and fatigue patterns, physicians' statements about their conditions, comparisons of their current states with the prior health conditions, and strong personal convictions that reflected a resistance to voicing any emotional changes. Patients also expressed primary health concerns, like back pain, that were not related to the chronic conditions (asthma, COPD or heart disease) under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: HRQoL studies and patient-clinician communications that incorporate global transition assessments to anchor the interpretations of HRQoL changes should also consider additional relevant questions to understand the process patients uses to appraise and report changes in HRQoL.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to understand the meaning and nature of pain experienced among patients with chronic pain. The present study adopted a hermeneutic phenomenological method which was developed by van Manen. METHOD: The participants for this study were 4 men and 5 women, who were over the age of 20 with chronic pain more than 6 months. Data was collected by using in-depth interviews and observations from September, 2004 to December, 2004. The contents of the interviews were tape-recorded with the consent of the subject. RESULT: The essential themes that fit into the context of the 4 existential grounds of body, time, space and other people were 'untamed and unremitting pain', 'the body as an obstacle', 'continuity of suffering time as if the moment would never end', 'a narrow radial range of action' and 'separating from other people'. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic pain experienced and perceived the world through the filter of their pain. It is necessary for nurses to understand the experiences of chronic pain patients and to provide more empathic, supportive care. Further research is needed on nursing interventions that could help chronic patients cope with and find the meaning in their suffering.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of Pilates exercise on improving health-related quality of life in people living with chronic low back pain. METHODS: This was a single-blind, randomised clinical trial. Thirty-nine physically active subjects aged between 30 and 70 years with nonspecific chronic low back pain for more than three months were recruited. The study employed a pretest-posttest design, with a 4 -, 8 -, and 26-week follow-up. For eight weeks, the intervention group participated in a group-supervised, mat-based Pilates program, while the control group received the usual pharmacologic and rehabilitation standard of care, including patient education on chronic low back pain. The primary outcome was self-perceived health status measured using the EQ-5D questionnaire in a structured form and a visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes included intensity of pain and degree of disability. RESULTS: By the end of the 8-week Pilates program, the intervention group achieved a better health-related quality of life on the EQ-5D visual analogue score than the control group. In assessing the trends in each individual group regarding pain, the intervention group demonstrated an earlier pain reduction than the control group that lasted until the end of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week supervised Pilates-based core exercise program is an effective therapeutic modality for improving self-perceived health status in patients with chronic low back pain. This finding could inform clinicians of better alternatives when they suggest exercise interventions for chronic low back pain.

AB  - Background: The Keele STarT Back Tool was designed for primary care medical physicians in the UK to determine the risk for persistent disabling pain in patients with musculoskeletal pain and to tailor treatments accordingly. In medical and physical therapy settings, STarT Back Tool's tailored care plans improved patients' low back pain outcomes and lowered costs. Objective: Review studies using the STarT Back Tool in chiropractic patient populations. Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Index to Chiropractic Literature, and Science Direct databases were searched. Articles written in English, published in peer-reviewed journals, that studied the STarT Back Tool in patients seeking chiropractic care were included. Results: Seven articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The STarT Back Tool was feasibly incorporated into 19 chiropractic clinics in Denmark. Total STarT Back 5-item score correlated moderately with total Bournemouth Questionnaire score. Two studies reported that the STarT Back Tool's predictive ability was poor, while another reported that the tool predicted outcomes in patients scoring in the medium and high risk categories who completed the STarT Back 2 days after their initial visit. A study examining Danish chiropractic, medical and physical therapy settings revealed that only baseline episode duration affected STarT Back's prognostic ability across all care settings. The tool predicted pain and disability in chiropractic patients whose episode duration was at least 2 weeks, but not in patients with an episode duration <2 weeks. Conclusion: While the STarT Back Tool can be incorporated into chiropractic settings and correlates with some elements of the Bournemouth Questionnaire, its prognostic ability is sometimes limited by the shorter low back pain episodes with which chiropractic patients often present. It may be a better predictor in patients whose episode duration is at least 2 weeks. Studies examining outcomes of stratified care in chiropractic patients are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain, one of the most common reasons for seeking healthcare services, causes significant negative impacts on individuals and society. Nonpharmacologic therapies and self-management are included in practice guidelines, but their implementation is challenging. AIM: To assess the feasibility of using an auricular point acupressure (APA) mobile app as a self-guided tool to learn and self-administer APA to manage chronic low back pain (cLBP) and to compare cLBP outcomes between 2 groups (app vs app + telehealth). DESIGN: A 2-phase study design was used. In phase 1, participants (app group, n = 18) had in-person study visits and installed the app to learn and self-administer APA to manage cLBP. In phase 2, all research activities occurred remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so a second group was recruited (app + telehealth, n = 19). The app + telehealth group underwent a virtual session, installed the app, and were provided the opportunity for questions and verification on the accuracy of the self-administered APA. SETTING: The participants were recruited by distributing study flyers at outpatient clinics and referrals. PARTICIPANTS: Participants with chronic low back pain were eliglbe for the study. METHODS: Using a quasi-experimental design with a mixed methods approach, all participants were instructed to download the APA app, provided an APA kit (includes seeds embedded within pre-cut squares of adhesive tape), and advised to self-administer APA with guidance from the app for 4 weeks to manage their cLBP. Study outcomes were collected at the preintervention time point as well as postintervention and 1-month follow-up. Interviews were also conducted at the postintervention time point. RESULTS: Of the 37 participants enrolled, six dropped out, and the attrition rate was 16%. Adherence to APA practice was high (85%-94%). After 4 weeks of APA treatment, participants in the app + telehealth group experienced a 29% decrease in pain intensity during the postintervention time point and a 35% reduction during the 1-month follow-up. Similar improvements were noted in pain interference (28%) and physical function (39%) for participants in the app + telehealth group at the 1-month follow-up. These changes are slightly higher compared with those in the app group (21% pain intensity reduction, 23% improved pain interferences, and 26% improved physical function) during the 1-month follow-up. Overall, APA was found to be feasible using the app and the qualitative findings showed acceptability of the intervention in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to learn and self-administer APA with an app, supplemented with either in-person or telehealth sessions, presenting a promising intervention toward cLBP self-management. Telehealth was found to boost this intervention effectively.

AB  - Pain Management Programmes (PMPs) are a multi-disciplinary approach to the management of chronic low back pain (CLBP). Notwithstanding evidence of effectiveness, successful take-up of programmes requires acceptability to patients. We used a discrete choice experiment to investigate patient preferences for alternative PMPs for managing CLBP in primary care. Specifically, we estimated the probability of uptake of alternative configurations of PMPs. Potential attributes and associated levels influencing take-up were identified through a systematic literature review, survey of current PMPs, expert consultation, and focus groups. Five attributes were included: content; provider; schedule; group size; and travel time to clinic. Four hundred and fourteen questionnaires were mailed to patients attending clinics and 124 questionnaires were returned suitable for analysis. Method of delivery influenced probability of take-up, with small group sizes and low intensity programmes over a prolonged period increasing the probabilities. Travel time was also important. However, providers and contents of PMPs were not main drivers of preferences, though those with more severe pain did prefer PMPs provided by more specialists. Probability of take-up increases when PMPs better reflect patient preferences. Given preferences, resource constraints, and evidence on clinical outcomes of alternative configurations it is suggested more resource-intensive PMPs be reserved for those with the most severe and disabling pain and less intensive programmes delivered over a longer time period in smaller groups for those with less severe pain. These findings can inform future randomised trials to evaluate acceptable PMPs in primary care.

AB  - AIM: Pain is an increasingly common phenomenon as people age; pain over a long period can result in limited functioning. The present study investigated the impacts of general and multisite-specific pain on activities of daily living and physical performance among older adults. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a representative sample of the population aged >=50 years. Face-to-face interview and nurse records were used from waves 2-6 (2004-2012) for analyses. General and site-specific pain (back, hip and knee) were measured biennially between 2004 and 2008 (n = 5010). Impaired activity of daily living and physical performance measures (chair rise and grip strength) between 2008 and 2012 were aggregated across assessments as outcomes. Multinomial logistic regressions were used for the former and linear regression for the latter, adjusting for potential covariates. RESULTS: General pain (moderate-to-severe) was prevalent, with close to one-quarter of participants reporting pain at least twice during the follow-up period. Multisite pain reports were strong predictors of subsequent limited activities of daily living (adjusted odds ratio range 1.86-3.97 for back and hip, 2.04-4.19 for back and knee, and 2.08-5.16 for hip and knee). Persistent pain was also strongly associated with worse physical performance outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the longitudinal impacts of persistent pain among older adults. The findings highlight the value of monitoring and management of both general and site-specific pain in order to promote sustained independence at older ages.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of combined transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) and electromagnetic millimeter wave (EMMW) therapy as an add-on treatment for pain relief and physical functional activity enhancement among adults with sub-acute non-specific spinal pain in either the low back or neck. DESIGN: A non-blinded study with data obtained before, immediate, one week and three months after intervention. SETTING: The Telehealth Clinic and Community Centre, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven subjects with either sub-acute neck or low back pain. INTERVENTION: Subjects were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n=23) or a control group (n=24). These groups were then divided into subgroups according to the site of their spinal pain-neck or back. The intervention group had eight treatments over a three-week period of TAES and EMMW. OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes from baseline to the end of treatment were assessed at intervals of one week and three months on either neck or low back pain intensity [by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)]; stiffness level; stress level; neck or low back lateral flexion and forward flexion in cm, and interference with daily activities. RESULTS: The baseline VAS scores for the intervention and control groups were 5.34 and 5.18 out of 10, respectively (P value=0.77). At the one week and three month assessments, there were no significant differences between the groups-VAS (P value=0.09 and 0.27, respectively). A further subgroup of chronic pain sufferers (n=31) was identified and these had significantly reduced pain intensity at the one week assessment (P value=0.04) but this was not sustained at post three months after treatment (P value=0.15). Improvements in stiffness level, stress level, and functional disability level in the intervention group were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that there was a reduction in pain intensity, stress and stiffness level immediately after the eight sessions of treatment (TAES and EMMW), though the effect is not sustained after a week. No pain relief was found with the neck pain subgroup. However, the reduction in subjective average pain intensity among the chronic pain subgroup was sustained at the post one week assessment for the intervention group but not at the post three month assessment.

AB  - Abstract: Chronic pain is associated with reduced quality of life, increased medical expenditures, and significant economic costs. Chronic pain is among the most common chronic conditions in the United States, although estimates vary widely regarding its precise prevalence. Understanding the scope of the problem using the most contemporaneous data is therefore an important goal. This study sought to determine the prevalence of chronic pain and its impacts among adults in the United States using the National Health Interview Survey, a household-based annual survey of self-reported health status of U.S. adults that can be used to generate national-level estimates. Using a chronic pain module introduced in the 2019 edition of National Health Interview Survey, we found that 50.2 million adults (20.5%) reported pain on most days or every day. The most common pain locations were back pain and hip, knee, or foot pain. The most commonly used management strategies for chronic pain were physical therapy and massage. Respondents with chronic pain reported limitations in daily functioning, including social activities and activities of daily living. Respondents with chronic pain reported significantly more workdays missed compared with those without chronic pain (10.3 vs 2.8, P < 0.001). Overall, these findings indicate that more than 1 in 5 adults in America experiences chronic pain; additional attention to managing the burden of this disease is warranted.

AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness training may help seniors successfully manage the physical and psychological challenges of aging in a manner that reduces distress and promotes vitality. The purpose of this retrospective analysis is to evaluate the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training on mood states in older adults. Methods: The authors identified 141 older adults (\u003e60 years) who completed MBSR training. All participants completed the Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF) at baseline and following 8 weeks of MBSR. Using paired t tests, the authors evaluated changes in mood following training in MBSR. In a subset analysis, the authors further examined the impact of MBSR training in individuals with the highest scores on depression and anxiety. Primary reasons cited for MBSR enrollment are also reported. Results: Overall emotional distress and all sub-scale mood measurements improved significantly following MBSR training. MBSR training resulted in \u003e50% reduction in the number of older p...

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the feasibility of a main RCT to compare the effectiveness of two frequencies (2 versus 5 times/week) of acupuncture treatment for chronic low back pain (LBP). METHODS: Participants (n=30) with chronic LBP were randomised into two groups to receive 10 acupuncture treatments: Low Frequency Group, 2 times/week for five weeks (n=15); High Frequency Group, 5 times/week for two weeks (n=15). The following outcomes were measured blindly at baseline, 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 3 months and 1 year: pain on a VAS, functional disability using the RMDQ, quality of life using the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP-2), psychological impact with the Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ) and Pain Locus of Control (PLC) questionnaire. Two objective outcomes, the Shuttle Walk Test (SWT) and Lateral Trunk Flexibility (LTF), were also measured. RESULTS: The compliance rate was 100% for each group. Some of the measurements were shown to be sensitive (VAS, RMDQ, MYMOP-2 Wellbeing). 66-330 participants would be required for a fully powered non-inferiority trial. The groups were balanced at baseline for LBP and demographic characteristics. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of any of the outcomes, at each follow-up time point. It was notable however that the clinically important improvement in terms of pain, functional disability, quality of life, and SWT in both groups was achieved within the first two weeks, which was maintained at one year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to conduct a main RCT, to compare different frequencies of acupuncture for LBP, using sensitive measurements. Also the trend for early clinically important improvement within a minimum of four measurements is worthy of further study.Copyright © 2009 by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine childhood traumatic experiences and dissociative characteristics in women with chronic headache and low back pain. SETTING: The patients were evaluated in the multidisciplinary pain clinic of a university hospital. SUBJECTS: This study included 73 patients: 41 with chronic headache and 32 with chronic low back pain. OUTCOME MEASURES: All the patients were assessed with use of a semistructured questionnaire, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), the Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ), and the Childhood Abuse and Neglect Questionnaire. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between the headache and low back pain groups in terms of prevalence of history of neglect; abuse; or sexual, physical, and emotional abuse separately. In addition, no significant differences were found between the groups with respect to the Dissociative Experiences Scale scores. However, analysis of the SDQ scores showed that the neglect rate in the two groups differed significantly. According to our findings, the neglect rate was higher in the headache group, thus warranting further research to investigate the sensitivity of the SDQ for neglect.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Long waiting time is an important barrier to accessing recommended care for low back pain (LBP) in Australia's public health system. This study describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that aims to establish the feasibility of delivering and evaluating stratified care integrated with telehealth ('Rapid Stratified Telehealth'), which aims to reduce waiting times for LBP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a single-centre feasibility and pilot RCT with nested qualitative interviews. Sixty participants with LBP newly referred to a hospital outpatient clinic will be randomised to receive Rapid Stratified Telehealth or usual care. Rapid Stratified Telehealth involves matching the mode and type of care to participants' risk of persistent disabling pain (using the Keele STarT MSK Tool) and presence of potential radiculopathy. 'Low risk' patients are matched to one session of advice over the telephone, 'medium risk' to telehealth physiotherapy plus App-based exercises, 'high risk' to telehealth physiotherapy, App-based exercises, and an online pain education programme, and 'potential radiculopathy' fast tracked to usual in-person care. Primary outcomes include the feasibility of delivering Rapid Stratified Telehealth (ie, acceptability assessed through interviews with clinicians and patients, intervention fidelity, appointment duration, App useability and online pain education programme usage) and evaluating Rapid Stratified Telehealth in a future trial (ie, recruitment rates, consent rates, lost to follow-up and missing data). Secondary outcomes include waiting times, number of appointments, intervention and healthcare costs, clinical outcomes (pain, function, quality of life, satisfaction), healthcare use and adverse events (AEs). Quantitative analyses will be descriptive and inform a future adequately-powered RCT. Interview data will be analysed using thematic analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has received approval from the Ethics Review Committee (RPAH Zone: X21-0221). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences. Trial registration number: Actrn12621001104842.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Psychosocial factors play an important role in the development and subsequent recovery of individuals suffering from chronic low back pain (CLBP). The study explored physiotherapists' personal beliefs and knowledge about the biopsychosocial model and the different ways they assess and manage psychosocial factors in patients presenting with CLBP. METHODS: Qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews and a constructivist grounded theory approach to data collection and analysis. A purposive sample of eight physiotherapists practicing in Italy and having experience with patients presenting chronic musculoskeletal problems were recruited from private clinics. RESULTS: Three main categories were constructed: 1) conceptions of the biopsychosocial model and its role in CLBP; 2) evaluation and management of PS factors; 3) barriers in the assessment and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Physiotherapists showed a basic knowledge of the biopsychosocial model and partially recognised social, emotional, cognitive and psychological factors in chronic low back pain patients, and their contribution in the individual patient's pain and disability. Physiotherapists highlighted the presence of barriers in the evaluation and treatment of people with CLBP, and some participants displayed a lack of skills to overcome these barriers. Physiotherapists perceived limited education and training to successfully address psychosocial factors in the management of patients with chronic low back pain, indicating the need to incorporate the biopsychosocial model in the daily practice and improve the training and education of the psychosocial assessment and management.

AB  - <b>Context:</b> Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex chronic condition with multiple self-management requirements and a high prevalence of complications. Pressure injuries (PIs) are among the most common ones and represent a frequent reason for re-hospitalization. This study aimed to identify styles of prevention that individuals with SCI adopt to deal with the risk of developing PIs. <b>Design:</b> Qualitative explorative interview study. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed verbatim and analyzed following the principles of thematic analysis. <b>Setting:</b> Switzerland. <b>Participants:</b> The participants were a purposive sample of community-dwelling Swiss residents with SCI for at least five years. <b>Interventions:</b> Not applicable. <b>Outcome measures:</b> Not applicable.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the coping strategies used by family caregivers of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Switzerland in order to develop tailored support programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Purposive sample of >18 years participants, speaking an official Swiss language fluently, being family caregivers of persons with SCI for at least 4 years, and perceiving either a high or low burden in relation to caregiving. Data were collected through face-to-face semi-structured interviews (N = 22). Thematic analysis was performed. RESULTS: Four main coping strategies were identified: reappraisal, active acceptance, setting limits to the caregiver role, and seeking support. These strategies can be used one at a time or combined, and at different times of a caregiver pathway. Our analysis highlighted that caregivers need skills to implement these strategies (e.g., self-evaluation skills). CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of persons with SCI develop cognitive coping strategies to make sense of the situation and establish a "new normal" and problem-focused coping strategies to deal with their new tasks and role. These strategies do not seem to be typical only of SCI caregivers. Hence, interventions that worked for caregivers in other fields could be adapted. Rehabilitation centers should systematically integrate programs targeted to caregivers into their offerings.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONHealthcare systems need to develop educational and support measures for both persons with a health condition and their caregivers.Caregivers should become long-term partners in rehabilitation and a regular and structured needs assessment should be offered. Interventions that worked for caregivers in other fields can be adapted to support also caregivers in SCI.Educational and support programs dedicated to caregivers should teach not only how to perform caregiving tasks but also how to balance between responding to the care recipient's needs and their own needs.

AB  - Pain is a multidimensional experience that involves interacting sensory, cognitive, and affective factors, rendering the treatment of chronic pain challenging and financially burdensome. Further, the widespread use of opioids to treat chronic pain has led to an opioid epidemic characterized by exponential growth in opioid misuse and addiction. The staggering statistics related to opioid use highlight the importance of developing, testing, and validating fast-acting nonpharmacological approaches to treat pain. Mindfulness meditation is a technique that has been found to significantly reduce pain in experimental and clinical settings. The present review delineates findings from recent studies demonstrating that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates pain through multiple, unique mechanisms-an important consideration for the millions of chronic pain patients seeking narcotic-free, self-facilitated pain therapy.

AB  - Although the construct of 'a symptom-free day' has been widely applied in asthma and gastric reflux disease, there is no analogous concept in the field of pain management. This study represents the initial development of a 'day of acceptable or manageable pain control,' a construct which reflects patients' daily strategic use of pain medication in order to allow the accomplishment of desired activities while minimizing side effects. Focus group methodology was used to extract patient-generated themes of 'an acceptable day of pain control.' Fifty-three outpatients with persistent moderate to severe average pain intensity due to osteoarthritis (n=18), metastatic cancer (n=15), and low back pain (n=20) participated. Participants preferred the term 'manageable' or 'tolerable' to 'acceptable.' Thematic analysis revealed components of a manageable/tolerable day of pain control as including: 1) taking the edge off the pain, 2) performing valued activities; 3) relief from dysphoria and irritability; 4) reduced medication side effects; 5) feeling well enough to socialize. Additional cancer-specific themes included relief from fatigue and ability to have a positive day when one's future days were perceived as being limited. The set of themes is presented and their relevance for developing a measure of 'a manageable day of pain control' discussed. Study findings identify a novel construct that can inform development of an outcome for evaluating the effectiveness of different pharmacotherapies for pain management.

AB  - Abstract:Having a better understanding of the intersection between chronic pain and obesity in the Mexican American community can be valuable for pain management specialists in determining treatment, service, and prevention strategies. The objectives of this study were (1) to describe the type and severity of chronic pain among overweight/obese Hispanic adults aged 40 years and older, and (2) to determine the association between chronic pain indices and key demographic variables, including excessive weight. Hispanic adults (N=101) were interviewed using validated questionnaires and measured for BMI and waist circumference. Data analyses revealed that most participants had widespread pain; 60% were suffering severe pain (including back, knee, and shoulder pain); the most common pain location was head (headache, 80%), followed by knee and upper back (75-76%), shoulder (73%) and lower back (73%). Greater obesity was associated with some negative pain outcomes. Results are relevant for pain management with this at-risk population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although mindfulness meditation (MM) is increasingly used for chronic pain treatment, limited evidence supports its clinical application for opioid-treated chronic low back pain (CLBP). The goal of this study was to determine feasibility, acceptability, and safety of an MM-based intervention in patients with CLBP requiring daily opioid therapy. DESIGN: 26-week pilot randomized controlled trial comparing MM-based intervention, combined with usual care, to usual care alone. SETTING: Outpatient. PATIENTS: Adults with CLBP treated with >=30 mg of morphine-equivalent dose (MED) per day for 3 months or longer. INTERVENTIONS: Targeted MM-based intervention consisted of eight weekly 2-hour group sessions and home practice (30 minutes/d, 6 days/wk) during the study. "Usual care" for opioid-treated CLBP was provided to participants by their regular clinicians. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility and acceptability of the MM intervention were assessed by adherence to intervention protocol and treatment satisfaction among experimental participants. Safety was evaluated by inquiry about side effects/adverse events and opioid dose among all study participants. RESULTS: Thirty-five participants enrolled during the 10-week recruitment period. The mean age (+/-standard deviation) was 51.8 +/- 9.7 years; the patients were predominantly female, with substantial CLBP-related pain and disability, and treated with 148.3 +/- 129.2 mg of MED per day. All participants completed baseline assessments; none missed both follow-up assessments or withdrew. Among experimental participants (n = 21), 19 attended 1 or more intervention sessions and 14 attended 4 or more. They reported, on average, 164.0 +/- 122.1 minutes of formal practice per week during the 26-week study and 103.5 +/- 111.5 minutes of brief, informal practice per week. Seventeen patients evaluated the intervention, indicating satisfaction; their qualitative responses described the course as useful for pain management (n = 10) and for improving pain coping skills (n = 8). No serious adverse events or safety concerns occurred among the study participants. CONCLUSIONS: MM-based intervention is feasible, acceptable, and safe in opioid-treated CLBP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is disabling and costly. Existing therapies have proven suboptimal, with many patients resorting to long-term opioid therapy, which can cause harms. Cognitive behavioral (CBT) and mindfulness-based (MBT) therapies can be effective and offer unique skills for safe pain coping. This article describes the protocol for a study evaluating comparative effectiveness of CBT and MBT in adults with opioid-treated CLBP. DESIGN: Pragmatic, multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT). SETTINGS: Community and outpatient care. PARTICIPANTS: Planned enrollment of 766 adults (383/group) with CLBP treated with long-term opioids (>=3 months; >=15 mg/day morphine-equivalent dose). INTERVENTIONS: CBT or MBT consisting of eight weekly therapist-led, two-hour group sessions, and home practice (>=30 min/day, 6 days/week) during the 12-month study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures, collected by self-report at baseline, then three, six, nine and 12 months post-entry, include co-primary measures: pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale) and function (Oswestry Disability Index), and secondary measures: quality of life (Medical Outcomes Study) and average daily opioid dose (Timeline Followback). Baseline scores of depression, anxiety, and opioid misuse questionnaires will be assessed as potential contributors to the heterogeneity of treatment response. Intention-to-treat, linear mixed-effects analysis will examine treatment effectiveness. Qualitative data will augment the quantitative measures. CONCLUSIONS: This will be the largest RCT comparing CBT and MBT in opioid-treated CLBP. It will provide evidence on the impact of these interventions, informing clinical decisions about optimal therapy for safe, effective care, improving quality of life and decreasing opioid-related harm among adults with refractory CLBP.

AB  - Background: The identification of the cause of chronic low back pain (CLBP) represents a great challenge to orthopedists due to the controversy over the diagnosis of discogenic low back pain (DLBP) and the existence of a number of cases of CLBP of unknown origin. This study aimed to develop diagnostic models to distinguish DLBP from other forms of CLBP and to identify serum biomarkers for DLBP.Methods: Serum samples were collected from patients with DLBP, chronic lumbar disc herniation (LDH), or CLBP of unknown origin, and healthy controls (N), and randomly divided into a training set (n = 30) and a blind test set (n = 30). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed for protein profiling of these samples. After the discriminative ability of two most significantly differential peaks from each two groups was assessed using scatter plots, classification models were developed using differential peptide peaks to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy. The identity of peptides corresponding to three representative differential peaks was analyzed.Results: The fewest statistically significant differential peaks were identified between DLBP and CLBP (3), followed by CLBP vs. N (5), DLBP vs. N (9), LDH vs. CLBP (20), DLBP vs. LDH (23), and LDH vs. N (43). The discriminative ability of two most significantly differential peaks was poor in classifying DLBP vs. CLBP but good in classifying DLBP vs. LDH. The accuracy of models for classification of DLBP vs. CLBP was not very high in the blind test (forecasting ability, 67.24%; sensitivity, 70%), although a higher accuracy was observed for classification of DLBP vs. LDH and LDH vs. N (forecasting abilities, ~90%; sensitivities, >90%). A further investigation of three representative differential peaks led to the identification of two peaks as peptides of complement C3, and one peak as a human fibrinogen peptide.Conclusions: Our findings benefit not only the diagnosis of CLBP but also the understanding of the differences between different forms of DLBP. The ability to distinguish between different causes of CLBP and the identification of serum biomarkers may be of great value to diagnose different causes of DLBP and predict treatment efficacy.

AB  - Purpose Of Review: Many studies have demonstrated that discogenic low back pain is the most common type of chronic low back pain (CLBP), one of the major causes of disability, and has a major socioeconomic impact. Our aim is to review present therapeutic interventions for discogenic low back pain.Recent Findings: There are a multitude of treatments used in clinical practice to treat CLBP, but there is continued debate and lack of consensus among clinicians and the policy makers as to which modality is the best approach. Based on controlled evaluations, lumbar intervertebral discs have been shown to be the source of chronic back pain without disc herniation in 26 to 39% of patients. Treatment modalities include noninvasive treatments such as drug therapy, multiple physical modalities, and multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation; interventional modalities such as intradiscal therapies and epidural injections; and regenerative modalities with disc injections of various solutions; and, finally, surgical approaches such as fusion and artificial disc replacement, all of which are accompanied by significant discussion, limited evidence, and lack of consensus. The results of this evaluation show that the evidence for drug therapy in chronic discogenic low back pain is limited; for multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation, it is moderate; and for multiple physical and behavioral therapies, the evidence is limited. For intradiscal therapies, it is poor; for epidural injections, it is moderate; and for regenerative therapies, evidence levels of 3 to 4. The evidence for surgical fusions and disc replacement is similar, without superiority when compared with multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation, well-designed physical therapy, or epidural injections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Central sensitization (CS) is often present in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Gait impairments due to CLBP have been extensively reported; however, the association between CS and gait is unknown. The present study examined the association between CS and CLBP on gait during activities of daily living. METHOD: Forty-two patients with CLBP were included. CS was assessed through the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI), and patients were divided in a low and high CS group (23 CLBP- and 19 CLBP+, respectively). Patients wore a tri-axial accelerometer device for one week. From the acceleration signals, gait cycles were extracted and 36 gait outcomes representing quantitative and qualitative characteristics of gait were calculated. A Random Forest was trained to classify CLBP- and CLBP + based on the gait outcomes. The maximum Youden index was computed to measure the diagnostic test's ability and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indexed the gait outcomes' importance to the classification model. RESULTS: The Random Forest accurately (84.4%) classified the CLBP- and CLBP+. Youden index was 0.65, and SHAP revealed that the gait outcomes' important to the classification model were related to gait smoothness, stride frequency variability, stride length variability, stride regularity, predictability, and stability. CONCLUSIONS: CLBP- and CLBP + patients had different motor control strategies. Patients in the CLBP- group presented with a more "loose control", with higher gait smoothness and stability, while CLBP + patients presented with a "tight control", with a more regular, less variable, and more predictable gait pattern.

AB  - Introduction Nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP) is a leading contributor to disease burden worldwide, and the management of NCLBP has always been a problem. This study is designed to explore the feasibility and efficacy of m-health-based core stability exercise (CSE) combined with self-compassion training (SCT) and compare it with m-health-based CSE alone for the management of NCLBP. Methods This study is a pilot, patient-blinded randomized controlled trial. Participants with NCLBP were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. All the participants received m-health-based CSE, but those in the intervention group also received SCT before CSE. The intervention took place weekly on Saturday or Sunday for 4 weeks in total. Patients self-assessed their outcomes by filling out electronic questionnaires at 4 and 16 weeks after the start of the study. The primary outcome metrics for these questionnaires were back pain disability (based on the Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ) and Pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS; current pain, worst pain, average pain). The secondary outcome metrics were anxiety (GAD-7,7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), Depression Symptoms (PHQ-9,Patient Health Questionnaire-9), pain catastrophizing (PCS, Pain Catastrophizing Scale) and Self-efficiency (PSEQ, Pain Self-Efficiency Questionnaire). Results A total of 37 patients comprising 28 (75.7%) females completed the study, with 19 patients in the intervention group and 18 in the control group. The mean (SD) patient age was 35.2 (11.1) years. For all primary outcomes, although there were no significant differences between groups, we found that participants in the intervention group improved function and pain earlier. The RMDQ score changed by − 1.771 points (95% CI − 3.768 to 0.227) from baseline to 4 weeks in the control group and by − 4.822 points (95% CI − 6.752 to − 2.892) in the intervention group (difference between groups, − 3.052 [95% CI − 5.836 to − 0.267]). Also, the RMDQ score changed by − 3.328 points (95% CI − 5.252 to − 1.403) from baseline to 16 weeks in the control group and by − 5.124 points (95% CI − 7.014 to − 3.233) in the intervention group (difference between groups − 1.796 [95% CI − 4.501 to 0.909]). A similar pattern was found in the NRS scores. For secondary outcomes, the intervention group was superior to the control group in for GAD-7 (intervention difference from CSE along at week 16, − 2.156 [95% CI − 4.434 to − 0.122; P value for group effect was 0.030]). At the end of treatment, the improvement in PCS in the intervention group was significant (difference in PCS score at week 4, − 6.718 [95% CI − 11.872 to − 1.564]). We also found significant changes in PCS in the control group (− 6.326 [95% CI, − 11.250 to − 1.401]) at the 16-week follow-up. As for PSEQ, there were no apparent differences between the two groups. There were no adverse events relented to study participation. Conclusions The pilot study is feasible to deliver, and our results indicate that participants in the group of m-health-based CSE combined with SCT may experience faster relief from pain intensity and back disability than those in the group of m-health-based CSE alone.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to measure the prevalence of multimorbidity in Bangladesh, India and China, and to assess the relationship between multimorbidity and patient's opinion regarding their involvement in healthcare decision-making and overall satisfaction of healthcare system. Cross-sectional data on 18 696 men and women aged 18 and above were collected from the World Health Survey of World Health Organization (WHO). Outcome variables were subjective rating of (1) healthcare system's ability to involve patients in decision-making, and (2) satisfaction with the way healthcare system runs in the country. Self-reported chronic conditions were used to measure the prevalence of multimorbidity. Out of 9 chronic conditions, back pain, arthritis, and chronic cough appeared to be the most prevalent ones among majority of the participants. About one-third of the participants in China (30.7%) and two-thirds in Bangladesh (66.1%) and India (66.6%) reported having at least one chronic illness. Prevalence of multimorbidity was highest in India (34.3%) followed by Bangladesh (28.8%) and China (14.3%). In Bangladesh, India and China, respectively 70.5%, 41.7%, 61.3% women and 54.5%, 42.8% and 58.8 % men expressed dissatisfaction regarding the way healthcare system runs in their country. In Bangladesh and India, men who were living with multimorbidity were more likely to rate the patient-centeredness as "bad" than those who had no disease illness. This study suggests that the prevalence of multimorbidity was remarkably high especially in Bangladesh and India. Higher likelihood of dissatisfaction about healthcare system among multimorbid patients might be indicative of inadequacy in the provision of care in qualitative and quantitative terms.

AB  - This study aimed to screen the prevalence of pain in Chinese community-dwelling older adults and to evaluate the effects of a brief mindfulness-based intervention on chronic pain. The prevalence of pain among Chinese older adults was 40.5%. The brief mindfulness intervention had significant effects on reducing pain intensity (P = 0.004), and increasing the mindfulness measures: observing, acting with awareness, non-judging and non-reactivity inner experience (all P values \u003c 0.05). Pain prevalence among Chinese older adults was relatively high. This study showed that a brief mindfulness-based intervention reduced ratings of pain intensity and enhanced ratings of the perception of mindfulness.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Individuals with chronic pain problems are at an increased risk for certain types of substance abuse and dependence. Recent work suggests that there is a significant association between chronic pain and cigarette smoking; however, it is unclear as to whether pain-smoking effects are evident above and beyond sociodemographic factors and cooccurring substance use disorders. The present investigation examined the relation between lifetime and current (past year) chronic pain and cigarette smoking status and nicotine dependence. METHODS: This investigation comprised a large representative sample of English-speaking adults (n = 9,282) residing in the United States. Data were collected primarily through face-to-face interviews conducted between February 2001 and April 2003. RESULTS: After adjusting for sociodemographic variables and the presence of a lifetime substance use disorder, individuals with a lifetime history of chronic neck or back pain were significantly more likely to be current smokers and to be diagnosed with lifetime as well as current nicotine dependence. Although there was no significant incremental relation between current chronic neck and back pain and being a current smoker, there was a significant association with lifetime and current nicotine dependence. Similar relations were evident among those with and without medically unexplained chronic pain in regard to smoking status and lifetime and current nicotine dependence. DISCUSSION: Findings are discussed in terms of better understanding the chronic pain-smoking association.

AB  - Background: Despite various quantitative studies reporting that pain is among the most serious problem in ankylosing spondylitis (AS), no detailed qualitative studies address how pain affects the life of patients with AS. Aim: To explore AS patients' experiences with pain and its effect on their lives. Design: Descriptive qualitative study. Methods: Data were collected by individual in-depth interviews. Colaizzi's phenomenological data analysis was performed. Results: During periods of pain, participants indicated that they experienced difficulty with performing their daily routine activities and meeting their personal needs. Pain also prevented them from fulfilling their responsibilities in their families, inhibited their social relations, and posed problems at their workplace. Due to the negative effects of pain in their lives, the participants felt helplessness, fear, stress, sadness, and unhappiness. Conclusions: Added to being asked about the quantity of pain, patients with AS should be questioned about how pain affects their lives.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore and describe the physiotherapy treatment experiences of persons with persistent musculoskeletal pain. Eleven participants with persistent musculoskeletal pain in the back, neck, or shoulders were included in the study. Data was collected via semi-structured interviews and were analysed with qualitative content analysis. The analysis resulted in the theme "Towards acceptance and management of pain", comprising four sub-themes: 1) Establishing and maintaining a therapeutic alliance; 2) Being active, taking initiative and facing challenges; 3) Appreciating guidance, incentive and having a sounding board; and 4) Acquired knowledge and new body awareness change behaviours. The theme and sub-themes describe how the participants used increased knowledge, awareness, movements and exercises learned from the physiotherapy treatment to develop strategies for managing pain and the process of acceptance. A trusting relationship and continual dialogue with the physiotherapist was considered to be important. The participants were actively involved in the process as exercises, activities and other treatment modalities were individualized. This was rewarding but also challenging and required effort on their part. The physiotherapist's initiatives and actions were an important incentive and means of support.

AB  - BackgroundSocietal, clinician and patient expectations of treatment outcomes may differ due to different measures of success. This may have implications for measuring progress, monitoring treatment success and patient satisfaction.ObjectiveTo explore patient communication about pain.MethodA qualitative study using in-depth interviews with people experiencing chronic pain.ResultsThirteen people living with chronic pain were interviewed, five males and eight females. Age range 24-83 years, all had chronic pain in at least one location, 10 had low back pain. We found that the most important outcome markers for patients were functional tasks that affected their every day living. The achievement of these tasks became personal goals. Patients used task achievement to determine treatment success, regardless of whether they had to modify the way they achieved these tasks. Perception of significant pain was characterised by loss of function and inability to self-manage.ConclusionTreatment progress can be more meaningfully monitored by using patient determined goals, rather than clinical outcomes. Patient criteria for success were determined by achieving functional tasks/goals that had previously been difficult. The additional use of aids or encouraging adaptive behaviour should not be under estimated as part of the treatment process. However, realistic goal setting remains an important issue that patients and clinicians can jointly negotiate and address.

AB  - Rehabilitation is defined in the National Service Framework for Long-Term Conditions as a multidisciplinary process. Partnership between health professionals and patients is a key component of the government's modernization of the NHS. Research has been undertaken to define the roles and functions of health professionals but there has been little investigation of the patient's role in the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to investigate patients' and professionals' perceptions of the patient's role in spinal cord injury rehabilitation. A qualitative approach using ethnographic techniques was adopted. Purposive sampling was used to select participants in a spinal cord injury unit in England. The sample comprised 30 professionals and 20 patients. Inductive analysis enabled patterns and themes to emerge from the data using a variant of the constant comparison method. A model of the patient's role was identified and tension was found between the concepts of 'taking control', 'working in partnership' and 'doing as you are told'. An understanding of the complexity of the patient's role in spinal cord injury rehabilitation may help professionals support patients in an exacting role.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to conduct an in-depth exploration of the 'journey' to diagnosis of people with ankylosing spondylitis (AS)/axial spondyloarthritis (Axial SpA) to gain insights into the experience, potential barriers and facilitators in this process. METHODS: The present qualitative study, embedded within a prospective longitudinal cohort study, was located within an interpretive phenomenological paradigm. Ten people newly diagnosed with AS/axial SpA, reporting an average of 10.1 [standard deviation (SD) 7.3] years between experiencing symptoms and diagnosis, participated in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained. RESULTS: Analysis identified four key themes: 'What's going on?' described the process associated with trying to understanding a changing body experience complicated by variability and the severity of back pain experienced. 'Fighting for a diagnosis' provided insights into the process of having to 'fight' to be believed and feeling dismissed by healthcare professionals. 'Being adrift' explored the negative psychological consequences associated with a search for a diagnosis. 'The start of a journey' described the relief associated with receiving a diagnosis, juxtaposed against emotions associated with the diagnosis of a long-term degenerative condition. CONCLUSIONS: The delay in diagnosis experienced may be associated with lack of familiarity and knowledge of AS/axial SpA in the population and in healthcare professionals, and creates a multiplicity of problems, including psychological distress. Clinicians therefore need to consider the potential impact of a person's 'journey to diagnosis' on clinical management once a diagnosis has been made.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The trend of decreasing length of stay in rehabilitation facilities has led to individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) entering the community with unmet needs and fewer self-care skills to prevent secondary complications. The implementation of a self-management program for individuals with SCI for the management of these complex needs, including secondary complications, may be one option to fill these care gaps. A greater understanding of the meaning of self-management may facilitate the development of a tailored self-management program in this population. Thus, the current research aims to understand the meaning of self-management in traumatic SCI from the perspectives of individuals with traumatic SCI and their caregivers as well as acute care/trauma and rehabilitation managers. METHODS: A descriptive qualitative approach was used. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 26 individuals with traumatic SCI, their family members/caregivers, and managers from acute care/trauma and rehabilitation centres. Inductive thematic analysis was applied. RESULTS: The meaning of self-management in SCI related to two overarching themes of internal and external responsibility attribution and revealed differences between the meaning of self-management in SCI among individuals with traumatic SCI and their caregivers versus managers. Overall, the meaning of self-management among the SCI and caregiver participants related principally to internal responsibility attribution. For the manager participants, the meaning of self-management was much narrower and the overarching theme of internal responsibility attribution that was observed among the SCI-caregiver dyads was not as widely expressed by this group. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that are co-created by users and health care professionals are associated with positive physical and mental health outcomes. Thus, the understanding of self-management from these varying perspectives could be applied to the development of a tailored self-management program that is relevant to individuals with traumatic SCI and their caregivers. This may involve the development of a program that uses some of the structure of traditional chronic disease self-management programs, in accordance with the beliefs held by the managers, but also incorporates elements of wellness/health promotion interventions, in accordance with the beliefs held by the SCI and caregiver participants.

AB  - Our research team developed a mobile application (app) to facilitate health-related self-management behaviors for secondary conditions among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). To facilitate mobile app adoption and ongoing use into the community, it is important to understand potential users' expectations and needs. The primary objective of this study was to explore user expectations of a mobile app intervention designed to facilitate self-management behavior among individuals with SCI. Data were collected via one-on-one, semi-structured interviews with a subsample of 20 community-dwelling participants enrolled in a larger, clinical trial. Analysis of the transcripts was undertaken using a six-phase process of thematic analysis. Our analysis identified three main themes for expectations of the mobile app intervention. The first theme, desiring better health outcomes, identified participants' expectation of being able to improve their psychological, behavioral, and physical health outcomes and reduce associated secondary conditions. The second theme, wanting to learn about the mobile app's potential, identified participants' interest in exploring the functionality of the app and its ability to promote new experiences in health management. The third theme, desiring greater personal autonomy and social participation, identified participants' desire to improve their understanding of their health and the expectation for the app to facilitate social engagement with others in the community. By exploring end-users' expectations, these findings may have short-term effects on improving continued mobile health app use among SCI populations and long-term effects on informing future development of mobile app interventions among chronic disease populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psychomotor therapy is an innovative complementary approach that enhances the mind-body connection. It could have a positive effect on chronic pain syndromes but has not yet been specifically studied for spinal pain. We thus aimed to explore the experiences of chronic spinal pain patients with psychomotor therapy. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. 17 patients with chronic spinal pain were recruited from a multidisciplinary spinal pain program in a rehabilitation hospital in Switzerland. Participants received psychomotor therapy as part of this care. All interviews were transcribed and thematic analysis was performed. SETTING: Division of General Medical Rehabilitation, Geneva University Hospitals, Geneva, Switzerland. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from thematic analysis: 1) Connecting body and mind; 2) Passive individualized care; 3) Effect on mobility and well-being versus pain; and 4) Need for further care. Participants particularly appreciated the person-centered approach, relaxation and link between body and mind in the psychomotor therapy sessions. They shared positive effects of psychomotor therapy on mobility, kinesiophobia and overall well-being, rather than on pain. Finally, they would have liked more follow-up care at the end of the program. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences reported by patients in this study suggest that psychomotor therapy could be a promising complementary therapy for chronic spinal pain within a biopsychosocial approach. To better understand the benefits of psychomotor therapy for chronic spinal pain, further research is needed and should consider patient-reported outcome measures such as well-being, fear-avoidance belief and disability.

AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate the recruitment to, and value of, an expert patient programme as part of the physiotherapy management of patients with chronic spinal pain.DesignA qualitative design incorporating semi-structured audiotaped interviews subsequently transcribed and coded. Interviews were held with patients as individuals and a group of nine physiotherapists participating in a single focus group.SettingInterviews were held in a physiotherapy department within a small community hospital.MethodInitially an expert patient programme was organised and 20 patients were recruited. Interviews were held with five patients who had declined to participate and five patients who agreed. Those who agreed were interviewed before and after participation in the programme. Nine physiotherapists involved in recruiting patients to the programme were interviewed collectively in a one-off focus group.ResultsPatients and physiotherapists were not well-informed about the expert patient programme and were uncertain as to its value. There was resistance amongst patients to join the programme for logistical, perceptual and personal reasons. Recruitment was time-consuming for the physiotherapists involved and required persistence, commitment and persuasiveness. Some physiotherapists felt that they had inadequate time to recruit patients and were uncertain as to who would be suitable. Attendance on the single programme studied was poor, with two out of a potential 12 patients attending all six of the sessions. Participants who attended the programme found it a positive and useful experience.ConclusionsThis study confirms previous work that found a low uptake of places on programmes and difficulties in recruiting. Physiotherapists managing patients with chronic spinal pain are unsure as to the efficacy of expert patient programmes but feel that they could be useful for a small number of patients who are psychologically ready and sufficiently motivated to join. Patients who are successfully recruited to a programme can gain benefits including empathy and support. Further work needs to be carried out to demonstrate the value of the programme to both patients and physiotherapists.

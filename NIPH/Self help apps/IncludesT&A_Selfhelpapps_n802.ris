AB  - Background: In this study, the effect of adding a smartphone app to an 8‐week global postural reeducation (GPR) on neck pain, endurance, quality of life, and forward head posture (FHP) in patients with chronic neck pain and FHP was evaluated. Methods: Sixty male and female office workers (38.5 ± 9.1 years) with chronic neck pain were randomly assigned into three groups: group 1 (GPR+ a smartphone app, n = 20), group 2 (GPR alone, n = 20), and group 3 (the control group, n = 20). The primary outcome was pain and the secondary outcomes were disability, quality of life, endurance, and posture. Pain, disability, endurance, quality of life, and posture were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS), neck disability index (NDI), progressive iso‐inertial lifting evaluation (PILE) test, quality of life questionnaire (SF‐36), and photogrammetry, respectively, at pre‐and post‐8‐week interventions. A one‐way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) has been conducted to statistically analyze the data. Results: The GPR+ a smartphone app had statistically significant improvements versus GPR alone in pain (mean difference, − 2.05 ± 0.65, ES (95% CI) − 0.50 (− 1.04 to − 0.01), P = 0.04), disability (difference = 11.5 ± 1.2, ES (95% CI) = 0.31 (0.22 to 0.97), p = 0.033), FHP (difference = 1.6 ± 0.2, ES (95% CI) = 0.31 (0.09 to 0.92), p = 0.047), and endurance (difference = 2 ± 3.3, ES (95% CI) = 0.51 (0.02 to 1.03), p = 0.039). Both of the GPR+ a smartphone app and GPR alone groups had statistically significant differences versus the control group in all outcomes. Conclusion: When a workplace assessment and management could not be as part of any intervention, adding a smartphone app to GPR for NP may be an appropriate tool to administer a home and work exercise program resulting in elevating pain and disability, as well as improving FHP and endurance. Trial registration: Current Controlled Trials using the UMIN‐RCT website UMIN000039720. Retrospectively registered on January 9, 2020.

AB  - Objective: Body image disturbance (BID) is common among women, characterized by persistent and distressing appearance dissatisfaction, and linked with eating disorders. Although effective, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered by trained professionals is not easily accessible. This randomized trial evaluated the effects of a CBT‐based mobile application designed to increase resilience to body image triggers and reduce BID symptoms. Method: A non‐clinical sample of women (N = 90; Mage = 23.52) was randomized to use the mobile application for approximately 4 min of daily exercises for two weeks or to a control condition. Body image was measured at baseline, immediately after two weeks of mobile application use, and at 1‐month follow‐up. To examine whether using the application was associated with increased resilience to common BID triggers, participants completed an Instagram exposure resilience task upon completion and at 1‐month follow‐up. Results: Relative to those in the control condition, participants who used the application demonstrated increased resiliency and reduced BID symptoms. Theses effects were medium‐to‐large and were maintained at 1‐month follow‐up. Conclusion: These results underscore the potential usefulness of brief, low‐intensity, portable interventions in reducing BID symptoms and in increasing resilience to thin‐ideal body messages often portrayed on social media.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is one of the most prevalent long‐term diseases seen in many countries, including Palestine. Patients with poorly controlled blood pressure are more likely to develop several complications. Therefore; it is imperative to control their blood pressure by improving their adherence to the treatment regimen. Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of using a mobile phone app on the level of adherence to treatment regimens among hypertensive patients in the Gaza Strip. Methods and results: This study used an experimental design with a pre and post‐intervention assessment. Using the Hill–Bone compliance to high blood pressure therapy scale, 191 participants completed the study: 94 in the control group and 97 in the intervention group. The intervention group used a phone app which reminds participants to take their medication, reminding them about their follow‐up appointments and sending educational information about hypertension management. After 3 months of intervention, the level of adherence to treatment was reassessed. Results showed that participants in both groups showed a significant improvement in adherence levels, with higher improvements in the intervention group in the total score as well as all three domain scores: adherence to medication, diet and keeping appointments. Conclusion: The use of a mobile phone app resulted in improvements in adherence to hypertension treatment. Thus, this study confirms the potential effectiveness of mobile technology in improving treatment adherence in hypertension and an opportunity to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, wider adoption has to be accompanied by ongoing evaluation and integration in public health systems.

AB  - Objectives: Consumer-grade electroencephalogram (EEG) devices designed to assist people with meditation are gaining popularity. This study investigates EEG-based outcome measures provided by the Muse device and their relation to mindfulness scores and mental health in a meditation intervention. Methods: Fifty-three novice meditators (university students taking part in the registered clinical trial NCT03402009) were asked to meditate 10 min per day for 1 month, randomly assigned to use (1) meditation app ("app group") or (2) meditation app, plus Muse neurofeedback device ("Muse group"). Pre- and post-intervention measures include Muse EEG scores assessed in a 5-min meditation and self-report scales of mindfulness and distress. A satisfaction survey and brief interview were conducted post-intervention. Results: Baseline levels of mindfulness on MINDSENS were not correlated with "calm" scores on Muse. Following the 1-month meditation intervention, neither meditation group demonstrated improvements in EEG outcome measures according to the Muse app; in fact, the app group performed significantly worse at follow-up compared to baseline according to Muse's user scores. Conversely, both groups showed significantly reduced distress and increased mindfulness scores following the intervention. Seventy-six percent of participants meditated at least three to four times per week, and both groups reported high levels of satisfaction with their meditation device (84% app group; 74% Muse group). Conclusions: Users, researchers, and clinicians should use caution in interpreting EEG outcomes on consumer-grade neurofeedback devices. Results suggest EEG outcome scores are not a proxy for mindfulness score, meditation practice, mental health status, or improvement over time in young adult novice meditators.

AB  - Objective: Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common chronic disease in the United States and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise, stress management) to reduce blood pressure (BP) are often complex with varying effectiveness. Breathing awareness meditation (BAM) is a stress management strategy with encouraging effects on BP, though widespread dissemination is hampered by the lack of an easy‐to‐use methodology to train and monitor BAM practices. A smartphone application (Tension Tamer [TT]) that implements BAM and tracks adherence has shown promise in addressing these gaps. This 6‐month dose‐response feasibility trial evaluated effects of the app on BP to further optimize BAM user guidelines. Methods: Sixty‐four adults with prehypertension were randomized to complete TT‐guided BAM sessions for 5‐, 10‐, or 15‐min intervals twice daily over 6 months. Continuous heart rate readings derived from the phone's video camera via reflective photoplethysmography were used as feedback and as an index of time‐stamped adherence. Outcomes (resting BP, HR) were collected at baseline, 1‐, 3‐, and 6‐months. Results: Mixed modeling results showed a significant time effect for systolic BP (SBP) with a dose‐response effect at Months 3 and 6. Adherence declined over time and was lowest in the 15‐min dose condition, though SBP reductions were maintained. Generally, adherence was negatively associated with dose as the study progressed. Conclusions: Smartphone‐implemented BAM appears to reduce SBP and can be a low‐cost method to reach large populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of the mobile e‐Tabac Info Service (e‐TIS) application (app) for helping adult smokers quit smoking with current practices. DESIGN: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial with a 1‐year follow‐up (2017‐2018). SETTING: France, population‐wide level. PARTICIPANTS: 2806 adult smokers who wished to quit smoking were recruited via the website of the French National Mandatory Health Insurance fund. Of them, 1400 were randomised to the e‐TIS app arm and 1406 were randomised to the current practices arm (control). INTERVENTION: The app involved personalised interactive contacts that included questionnaires, advice, activities and text messages. All contacts were individually tailored and based on each smoker's progress.In the control group, recommended practices for quitting smoking were described on a non‐interactive website. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome was 7‐day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 6 months. The secondary outcomes included continuous abstinence rates at 6 and 12 months, minimum 24‐hour point abstinence at 3 months, minimum 30‐day point abstinence at 12 months and number and duration of quit attempts. RESULTS: There was no difference between the e‐TIS and control arms for the primary outcome (12.6% vs 13.7% for 7‐day PPA at 6 months, p=0.3949, intention‐to‐treat analysis). However, e‐TIS participants with high levels of exposure to the app, which was defined by the completion of at least eight activities or questionnaires, showed higher rates of smoking cessation than the control participants (17.6% vs 12.9% for 7‐day PPA at 6 months, p=0.0169, per‐protocol analysis). CONCLUSION: Use of the e‐TIS app was not associated with a higher rate of smoking cessation. However, high level of exposure to the e‐TIS app may have been more effective than current practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has put pressure on health systems to appropriately manage these patients, there have been a growing number of mobile apps designed to improve the self‐management of diabetes. One such app, BlueStar, has been shown to significantly reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in small studies and is the first app in the United States to receive Food and Drug Administration approval as a mobile prescription therapy. However, the impact of the app across real‐world population among different clinical sites and health systems remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of the BlueStar mobile app to determine if app usage leads to improved HbA1c levels among diverse participants in real‐life clinical contexts. We hypothesized that this mobile app would improve self‐management and HbA1c levels compared with controls. METHODS: The study consisted of a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Overall, 110 participants randomized to the immediate treatment group (ITG) received the intervention for 6 months, and 113 participants randomized to the wait‐list control (WLC) group received usual care for the first 3 months and then received the intervention for 3 months. The primary outcome was glucose control measured by HbA1c levels at 3 months. Secondary outcomes assessed intervention impact on patient self‐management, experience of care, and self‐reported health utilization using validated scales, including the Problem Areas in Diabetes, the Summary of Diabetes Self‐Care Activities, and the EuroQol‐5D. Intervention usage data were collected directly from the app. RESULTS: The results of an analysis of covariance controlling for baseline HbA1c levels did not show evidence of intervention impact on HbA1c levels at 3 months (mean difference [ITG‐WLC] ‐0.42, 95% CI ‐1.05 to 0.21; P=.19). Similarly, there was no intervention effect on secondary outcomes measuring diabetes self‐efficacy, quality of life, and health care utilization behaviors. An exploratory analysis of 57 ITG participants investigating the impact of app usage on HbA1c levels showed that each additional day of app use corresponded with a 0.016‐point decrease in participants' 3‐month HbA1c levels (95% CI ‐0.03 to ‐0.003). App usage varied significantly by site, as participants from 1 site logged in to the app a median of 36 days over 14 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 10.5‐124); those at another site used the app significantly less (median 9; IQR 6‐51). CONCLUSIONS: The results showed no difference between intervention and control arms for the primary clinical outcome of glycemic control measured by HbA1c levels. Although there was low usage of the app among participants, results indicate contextual factors, particularly site, had a significant impact on overall usage. Future research into the patient and site‐specific factors that increase app utilization are needed.

AB  - Background: Food labelling is a common intervention to improve diets, where the back‐of‐pack Nutrition Information Panel (or Nutrition Facts table (NFt)) provides comprehensive nutrition information on food packages. However, many consumers find it difficult and time‐consuming to identify healthier foods using the NFt. As a result, different interpretative nutrition rating systems (INRS) may enable healthier food choices and it is essential that consumers have the tools to allow for easily accessible nutrition information. The objective of this study was to examine consumers' perceptions of different (INRS) for delivery of nutrition information using different versions of a smartphone app, FoodFlip Â©. Methods: This study was part of a larger randomized controlled trial examining consumer perceptions of different INRS on food products. A nationally representative commercial sample of 2008 Canadians were randomized to one of four INRS intervention groups: 1) traffic light, 2) health star rating, 3) 'high‐in' warning labels or 4) no INRS (NFt only; control) and asked to scan or enter 20 products into FoodFlipÂ© from a list of food products provided to them with varying levels of healthfulness. After completing the app task, participants were asked a series of 7‐point Likert‐scale and open‐ended questions to provide opinions on the usability and functionality of the app. Results: Of the survey sample of 1997 participants, 95% (n = 1907) completed the app task, with similar number of participants in each treatment group. The mean age was 40 Â± 12 years with no differences in sociodemographic characteristics between treatment groups. The health star rating ranked significantly lower in comparison to the other treatment groups in terms of usefulness (OR, 95% CI ‐0.67, 0.52‐0.85), believability (0.59, 0.46‐0.75), and understanding (0.55, 0.44‐0.71) (p < 0.001). The health star rating (1.20, 0.94‐1.53) and control (NFt) (1,1,1) ranked significantly lower than the traffic light or the 'high‐in' warning labels for their ability to compare the healthfulness of products (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrated Canadian consumers' preference for a nutrient‐specific system (i.e. traffic light or 'high‐in' warning labels). The app, which was liked by majority of the participants for its functionality and usability, has the potential to support healthy dietary decision making and may also encourage reformulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) tools may be useful platforms for dietary monitoring and assessment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile dietary self‐monitoring app for weight loss versus a paper‐based diary among adults with a BMI of 23 kg/m2 or above. METHODS: A total of 33 men and 17 women aged 18‐39 years participated in a 6‐week randomized controlled trial. We randomly assigned participants to one of two groups: (1) a smartphone app group (n=25) or (2) a paper‐based diary group (n=25). The smartphone app group recorded foods and dietary supplements that they consumed and received immediate dietary feedback using Well‐D, a dietary self‐monitoring app developed by our team. The paper‐based diary group was instructed to record foods or supplements that they consumed using a self‐recorded diary. The primary outcomes were weight, BMI, waist circumference, body fat mass, and skeletal muscle mass. We also examined changes in nutrient intake, including energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, using 3‐day 24‐hour recalls. Differences in changes between the two groups were analyzed using independent t tests or Wilcoxon Mann‐Whitney tests. All of the data were analyzed using intent‐to‐treat analysis. RESULTS: The mean number of days recorded was 18.5 (SD 14.1) for the app group and 15.5 (SD 10.1) for the paper‐based diary group. The differences in changes in weight, BMI, and waist circumference were not significantly different between the app group and paper‐based diary group (P=.33, .34, and .70, respectively). Similarly, changes in body fat mass or skeletal muscle mass did not differ between the two groups (P=.71 and .054, respectively). Although energy intake was reduced in both groups, there was no significant difference in changes in energy intake between the two groups (P=.98). CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in changes in anthropometric measures and nutrient intake between the app group and the paper‐based diary group. Both mobile dietary self‐monitoring app and paper‐based diary may be useful for improving anthropometric measures.

AB  - Purpose: Insomnia has adverse effects on people with epilepsy. We aimed to test a novel cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I) app‐based intervention on insomnia symptoms and social psychological factors in people with epilepsy and to examine the possible mechanisms among the factors. Methods: Participants were recruited from neurology clinics in Iran and comprised individuals diagnosed with epilepsy and having moderate to severe insomnia. A two‐arm randomized controlled trial design was used, consisting of a treatment group (CBT‐I; n = 160) and control group (patient education; n = 160). Primary outcomes were self‐reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and sleep hygiene behavior and objective sleep characteristics measured by actigraphy. Secondary outcomes were attitude, perceived behavioral control, intention, action planning, coping planning, behavioral automaticity, self‐monitoring, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at one, three, and six months postintervention, except objective sleep, which was assessed at baseline, and one and six months postintervention. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models. Results: Current findings showed that sleep quality, insomnia severity, sleep hygiene behavior, and sleep onset latency were significantly improved in the CBT‐I group compared with the patient education group at all measurement points. Also, the CBT‐I group had significantly improved anxiety, depression, and QoL compared with the patient education group. Mediation analyses showed that attitude, intention, coping planning, self‐monitoring, and behavioral automaticity significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on sleep outcomes. Conclusion: Results support the use of the CBT‐I app to improve sleep outcomes among people with epilepsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phone‐based assessment may represent a cost‐effective and clinically effective method of monitoring psychotic symptoms in real‐time. There are several software options, including the use of native smartphone applications and text messages (short message service, SMS). Little is known about the strengths and limitations of these two approaches in monitoring symptoms in individuals with serious mental illness. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare two different delivery modalities of the same diagnostic assessment for individuals with non‐affective psychosis‐a native smartphone application employing a graphical, touch user interface against an SMS text‐only implementation. The overall hypothesis of the study was that patient participants with sewrious mental illness would find both delivery modalities feasible and acceptable to use, measured by the quantitative post‐assessment feedback questionnaire scores, the number of data points completed, and the time taken to complete the assessment. It was also predicted that a native smartphone application would (1) yield a greater number of data points, (2) take less time, and (3) be more positively appraised by patient participant users than the text‐based system. METHODS: A randomized repeated measures crossover design was employed. Participants with currently treated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition) schizophrenia or related disorders (n=24) were randomly allocated to completing 6 days of assessment (four sets of questions per day) with a native smartphone application or the SMS text‐only implementation. There was then a 1‐week break before completing a further 6 days with the alternative delivery modality. Quantitative feedback questionnaires were administered at the end of each period of sampling. RESULTS: A greater proportion of data points were completed with the native smartphone application in comparison to the SMS text‐only implementation (β = ‐.25, SE=.11, P=.02), which also took significantly less time to complete (β =.78, SE= .09, P<.001). Although there were no significant differences in participants' quantitative feedback for the two delivery modalities, most participants reported preferring the native smartphone application (67%; n=16) and found it easier to use (71%; n=16). 33% of participants reported that they would be willing to complete mobile phone assessment for 5 weeks or longer. CONCLUSIONS: Native smartphone applications and SMS text are both valuable methods of delivering real‐time assessment in individuals with schizophrenia. However, a more streamlined graphical user interface may lead to better compliance and shorter entry times. Further research is needed to test the efficacy of this technology within clinical services, to assess validity over longer periods of time and when delivered on patients' own phones.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) is important for health outcomes like breast cancer, but most U.S. adults do not meet recommended guidelines. Behavioral theories like the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) have demonstrated success in PA behavior change, but perceived benefits and barriers are understudied. PA time barriers are shared between healthy and cancer survivor populations, and study of time use in breast cancer survivors using mobile phone technology like the Life in a Day (LiaD) app would support future intervention development. We conducted 3 studies to investigate benefits and barriers to PA in adults and time use among breast cancer survivors to fill these evidence gaps.Study 1 was a secondary analysis of inactive adults (N=63) in a 12-week IVR-supported randomized-controlled PA trial. Exercise Benefits and Barriers Scale (EBBS) data was summarized; associations (Pearson's correlation), within-group differences (paired t-test), and between-group differences (independent t-test) related to benefits and barriers were explored. Open-ended exit interview responses were qualitatively examined. Study 2 tested the acceptability of a 5-day LiaD app trial in breast cancer survivors (N=40), explored between-group differences (independent t-test) in LiaD app satisfaction, and qualitatively examined open-ended survey responses. Study 3 was a secondary analysis of breast cancer survivor (N=97) time use in a 6-month randomized-controlled PA trial. Within-group (paired t-test) and between-group (independent t-test) changes in LiaD-reported time use minutes and intensity were explored. Time use data was compared to total self-report/accelerometer MVPA measures.In study 1, time and physical exertion were leading exercise barriers. Intervention arm barriers significantly decreased relative to control from baseline to week 12; intervention females increased benefits and decreased barriers while men did not. Benefits and barriers were associated with other SCT constructs but not with baseline MVPA. Qualitative themes corroborated quantitative findings. In study 2, LiaD was found to be acceptable for breast cancer survivor time use measurement; age-related problems with remembering to track or edit activities were indicated. Themes corroborated quantitative results and suggested future app improvements. In study 3, intervention sleep/rest time use minutes increased relative to usual care from baseline to month 6; trends were noted for between-group changes in sitting minutes at month 3 and participant-labeled physical activity intensity at month 6.In conclusion, lack of time remains a common barrier among adults, but remote intervention shows promise for targeting barriers in women. Further, mobile phone time use measurement is an acceptable approach for understanding daily living in breast cancer survivors and provides a different perspective of PA behavior compared to measures of total PA. We can better inform future intervention efforts for breast cancer survivors by improving our understanding of time use in this population.

AB  - In recent years, the number of smart phone applications developed for physical and mental health has been rapidly increasing. The rapid growth in the use of smart phone applications provides an alternative and supportive option for the treatment of mental illnesses. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the effectiveness of mobile applications related to mental health by using randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Within the scope of the study, English articles published in several databases were searched using specific terms. Twelve eligible studies fulfilling the research criteria were evaluated in terms of contents, sampling, study method and findings of the applications. The findings of the current studies revealed that mobile applications are generally effective in reducing the symptoms of the mental illness and feasibility and usability of smart phone applications were reported by participants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence rates of preventative medication for cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported as 57%, and approximately 9% of all CVD events in Europe are attributable to poor medication adherence. Mobile health technologies, particularly mobile apps, have the potential to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the effects of mobile health care apps on medication adherence and health-related outcomes in patients with CVD. This study also evaluates apps' functionality and usability and the involvement of health care professionals in their use. METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE [Ovid], PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO [Ovid], Embase [Ovid], and Google Scholar) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate app-based interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in patients with CVD. RCTs published in English from inception to January 2020 were reviewed. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed for clinical outcomes and medication adherence, with meta-regression analysis used to evaluate the impact of app intervention duration on medication adherence. RESULTS: This study included 16 RCTs published within the last 6 years. In total, 12 RCTs reported medication adherence as the primary outcome, which is the most commonly self-reported adherence. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 to 12 months, and sample sizes ranged from 24 to 412. Medication adherence rates showed statistically significant improvements in 9 RCTs when compared with the control, and meta-analysis of the 6 RCTs reporting continuous data showed a significant overall effect in favor of the app intervention (mean difference 0.90, 95% CI 0.03-1.78) with a high statistical heterogeneity (I2=93.32%). Moreover, 9 RCTs assessed clinical outcomes and reported an improvement in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the intervention arm. Meta-analysis of these clinical outcomes from 6 RCTs favored app interventions, but none were significant. In the 7 trials evaluating app usability, all were found to be acceptable. There was a great variation in the app characteristics. A total of 10 RCTs involved health care professionals, mainly physicians and nurses, in the app-based interventions. The apps had mixed functionality: 2 used education, 7 delivered reminders, and 7 provided reminders in combination with educational support. CONCLUSIONS: Apps tended to increase medication adherence, but interventions varied widely in design, content, and delivery. Apps have an acceptable degree of usability; yet the app characteristics conferring usability and effectiveness are ill-defined. Future large-scale studies should focus on identifying the essential active components of successful apps.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effects of an Arabic smartphone application on adherence to home exercise programs (HEPs) and the effectiveness of mobile‐based HEPs on pain, physical function, and lower‐limb muscle strength among older women with knee osteoarthritis (OA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomised control trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: (NCT04159883) enrolled 40 women aged ≥50 years with knee OA who were randomised into the app group (experimental; n = 20) receiving HEPs using an Arabic smartphone application called "My Dear Knee", whereas the paper group (control; n = 20) receiving HEPs as hand‐outs. Both groups had the same exercise program. Outcome measures were self‐reported adherence, changes in the Arabic Numeric Pain Rating Scale, the Arabic version of the reduced Western Ontario, McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index‐Physical Function subscale, and Five‐Times Sit‐To‐Stand Test scores. All participants were assessed at baseline, at week 3 and week 6. Using completer‐only analyses, the repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the means of the outcome measures between the two groups. RESULTS: At the end of week 6, the app group reported greater adherence to HEPs (p = .002) and significant reduction in pain (p = .015). CONCLUSIONS: A smartphone application with motivational and attractive features could enhance adherence to HEPs in this patient cohort. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Older adults with knee OA may face many obstacles that prevent or limit their adherence to the prescribed HEP. Smart device apps supported with attractive and motivational features could be an effective strategy to enhance adherence to HEPs among older adults with knee OA. Using such remote technology appears to overcome the barriers that may limit the ability of older women to receive supervised physical therapy in a clinical setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a chronic disease that is considered to be a public health problem and requires efforts by patients to manage themselves. The global growth in the use of mobile phones and tablets has been accompanied by the increased use of health apps. Many of these apps support the self-management of hypertension and, therefore, they have the potential benefits of lowering blood pressure. Despite this, there is currently a lack of evidence for their effectiveness, usability, and patient satisfaction with their use. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of apps in lowering blood pressure, as well as their usability and patients' satisfaction with their use. METHODS: We conducted searches in the following databases: MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID), PsycINFO (OVID), CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), IEEE Xplore ASSIAN, Google Scholar and the main Arabic databases Al Manhal, AskZad, and Mandumah. We looked for studies that used apps in the self-management of hypertension from 2008-2016. We also checked the reference lists of the review papers and all the primary studies for additional references. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies with a total of 3112 participants were included in the review. Of the 14 studies that assessed the effectiveness of the apps in lowering blood pressure, 10 (71.4%) studies (6 RCTs and 4 nonrandomized studies) reported that using the apps led to significant decreases in blood pressure and seemed to be effective in the self-management of hypertension. Of these 10, only 2 (20%) RCTs and 3 (30%) nonrandomized studies had a low-moderate risk of bias. The results of this review are inconclusive regarding which combinations of functionalities would be most effective in lowering blood pressure because of variation in the studies' quality, but the data suggest that apps incorporating more comprehensive functionalities are likely to be more effective. In all the studies that assessed the usability of the apps and users' acceptance of them, all the apps seemed to be accepted and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies reported that apps might be effective in lowering blood pressure and are accepted by users. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, as most of the studies had a high risk of bias. More well-designed, large-scale studies are required to evaluate the real effect of using apps in lowering blood pressure and to identify the most effective functionality combinations for lowering blood pressure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The established interventions for weight loss are resource intensive which can create barriers for full participation and ultimate translation. The major goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of theoretically based behavioral interventions delivered by smartphone technology. METHODS: The study randomized 68 obese adults to receive one of four interventions for six months: (1) intensive counseling intervention, (2) intensive counseling plus smartphone intervention, (3) a less intensive counseling plus smartphone intervention, and (4) smartphone intervention only. The outcome measures of weight, BMI, waist circumference, and self‐reported dietary intake and physical activity were assessed at baseline and six months. RESULTS: The sample was 78% female and 49% African American, with an average age of 45 years, and average BMI of 34.3 kg/m(2). There were trends for differences in weight loss among the four intervention groups. Participants in the intensive counseling plus self‐monitoring smartphone group and less intensive counseling plus self‐monitoring smartphone group tended to lose more weight than other groups (5.4 kg and 3.3 kg, resp.). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot trial of a weight loss intervention provide preliminary support for using a smartphone application for self‐monitoring as an adjunct to behavioral counseling.

DESIGN: A double‐blinded randomized controlled trial where participants randomly assigned to either an experimental group (EG) or a control group (CG). SETTING: Governmental and private institutions. PARTICIPANTS: About 40 office workers, aged 30 to 55 years, had pain due to non‐specific LBP > 3 on Visual Analogue Scale, and with pain chronicity > 3 months. INTERVENTIONS: The EG received full version of the application 'Relieve my back' included evidence‐based instructions and therapeutic exercises for LBP management, whereas the CG received placebo version included instructions about nutrition. MAIN MEASURES: Primary outcome measures included pain measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), disability measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and quality of life measured by Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐12). RESULTS: Following six weeks of using the application, compared to CG, the EG group demonstrated significant decrease in pain intensity (‐3.45 (2.21) vs ‐0.11 (1.66), P < 0.001), in ODI score (‐11.05 (10.40) vs ‐0.58 (9.0), P = 0.002), and significant increase in physical component of SF‐12 (12.85 (17.20) vs ‐4.63 (12.04), P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: 'Relieve my back' application might be efficacious in reducing pain and disability and improving the quality of life of office workers with non‐specific LBP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 'My Retainers' mobile application is a patient‐informed intervention designed to enhance removable retainer wear and associated patient experiences during the retention phase. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of receiving the 'My Retainers' application on objectively assessed thermoplastic retainer (TPR) wear time, stability, periodontal outcomes, patient experiences, and knowledge related to retainers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty‐four participants planned for removable retention with TPRs were assigned either to receive the 'My Retainers' application or to control not receiving electronic reminders during the 3‐month period. Randomization was based on computer‐generated random numbers and allocation was concealed using opaque, sealed envelopes. The primary outcome was objectively assessed retainer wear recorded using an embedded TheraMonÂ® micro‐electronic sensor. Secondary outcomes, including irregularity of the maxillary and mandibular incisors, plaque levels, bleeding on probing and probing depth, were assessed at baseline and 3‐month follow‐up; and analysed using a series of mixed models. Experiences and knowledge related to orthodontic retainers were recorded using questionnaires. The outcome assessor was blinded when possible. RESULTS: Receipt of the mobile application resulted in slightly higher median wear time (0.91 hours/day); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: ‐2.19, 4.01). No significant differences were found between the treatment groups in terms of stability (P = 0.92; 95% CI: ‐0.03, 0.04), plaque levels (P = 0.44; 95% CI: ‐0.07, 0.03), bleeding on probing (P = 0.61; 95% CI: ‐0.05, 0.03) and probing depth (P = 0.79; 95% CI: ‐0.09, 0.07). Furthermore, similar levels of patient experiences (P = 0.94) and knowledge related to retainers (P = 0.26) were found. However, marginally better levels of knowledge were identified in the intervention group. No harms were observed. LIMITATIONS: A relatively short follow‐up period with the study confined to a single‐center in a university‐based hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of the bespoke 'My Retainers' application did not lead to an improvement in adherence with TPR wear over a 3‐month follow‐up period. Further refinement and research are required to develop and investigate means of enhancing adherence levels. CLINICAL REGISTRATION: NCT03224481.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this project was to systematically review the effectiveness of mobile applications and social media-based interventions in producing a behavioral change in orthodontic patients. METHODS: Electronic databases and reference lists of relevant studies were searched on March 1, 2021, with no language restrictions (PROSPERO: CRD42019157298). Randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials assessing the impact of mobile applications and social media-based interventions on orthodontic patients were identified. Primary outcomes included adherence to wear, appointment attendance, knowledge, oral health-related behaviors, oral hygiene levels, periodontal outcomes, and related iatrogenic effects. The quality of the included trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools. A weighted treatment effect of interventions on periodontal outcomes was calculated. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. RESULTS: A total of 3617 articles were identified. Of these, 16 studies (14 randomized controlled trials and 2 nonrandomized controlled trials) were deemed eligible. Nine randomized controlled trials were judged to be of either low or unclear risk of bias. The intervention was favored in relation to gingival and plaque indexes, standardized mean difference: -0.81 (95% confidence intervals [CI], -1.35 to -0.28) and -0.91 (95% CI, -1.64 to -0.19), respectively. However, no significant effect was observed in bleeding on probing (standardized mean difference: -0.22; 95% CI, -0.5 to 0.05). The level of evidence was high in probing depth and bleeding on probing outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: A very low to moderate level of evidence supports the effects of mobile applications and social media-based interventions in producing positive behavioral changes in orthodontic patients. Further high-quality trials would assist in further elucidating the potential of these approaches to influence orthodontic treatment outcomes and experiences.

AB  - The rate of breast cancer is growing in the world, especially in Asian countries. There is a need to increase the level of knowledge among women to recognize it in the early stages. This study tried to determine the effectiveness of the use of educational breast cancer smartphone application in increasing knowledge and breast self‐examination practices among female students. We comprised two phases including developing an educational application and also evaluation of educational protocol through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The first phase was based on qualitative approach and the second phase of study was for selection of participants. Baseline data were collected from 144 female students (72 intervention group and 72 control group). The research instruments including knowledge, practice, health belief and technology acceptance were adapted and adopted based on literature review, content and face validity. Data were collected at baseline, one month, three months and six months after intervention for both groups. It was shown that the effect of intervention on knowledge of breast cancer in pre, post‐test and follow up tests was significant and the level of knowledge in intervention group was increased after using the application.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a 6‐week smartphone compassion training intervention on mental health. METHOD: Fifty‐seven Swedish university students (mean age = 25, SD = 5) reporting high levels of stress were randomized to compassion training (n = 23), mindfulness (n = 19), or waitlist (n = 15). RESULT: Multilevel models indicated that both compassion and mindfulness training increased self‐compassion compared to the waitlist, while only compassion significantly reduced stress. Between‐group effect sizes for compassion compared to waitlist were large for both self‐compassion (d = 1.61) and stress (d = 0.94). Compassion and mindfulness did not differ significantly, but effect sizes were in favor of compassion. Secondary outcomes indicated positive effects on emotional awareness, while no effect was found for global psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that compassion training via a smartphone application can improve self‐compassion and reduce stress among university students. Future studies in larger clinical samples are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps have shown potential in enhancing weight management in Western populations in the short to medium term. With a rapidly growing obesity burden in Asian populations, researchers are turning to apps as a service delivery platform to reach a larger target audience to efficiently address the problem. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the efficacy of interventions that incorporate apps in facilitating weight loss and health behavior change in the Asian population. METHODS: A total of 6 databases were searched in June 2020. The eligible studies included controlled trials in which an app was used in the intervention. The participants were aged 18 years or older and were of Asian ethnicity. A meta-analysis to test intervention efficacy, subgroup analyses, and post hoc analyses was conducted to determine the effects of adding an app to usual care and study duration. The primary outcome was absolute or percentage weight change, whereas the secondary outcomes were changes to lifestyle behaviors. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were included in this review, and 17 (81%) were selected for the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size across 82% (14/17) of the randomized controlled trials for weight change was small to moderate (Hedges g=-0.26; 95% CI -0.41 to -0.11), indicating slightly greater weight loss achieved in the intervention group; however, this may not be representative of long-term studies (lasting for more than a year). Supplementing multicomponent usual care with an app led to greater weight loss (Hedges g=-0.28; 95% CI -0.47 to -0.09). Asian apps were largely culturally adapted and multifunctional, with the most common app features being communication with health professionals and self-monitoring of behaviors and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: More evidence is required to determine the efficacy of apps in the long term and address the low uptake of apps to maximize the potential of the intervention. Future research should determine the efficacy of each component of the multicomponent intervention to facilitate the designing of studies that are most effective and cost-efficient for weight management.

AB  - Background: Prepregnancy maternal obesity and excessive weight gain during pregnancy lead to significant morbidities in mothers and their children. Mothers who never return to their prepregnancy weight begin subsequent pregnancies at a greater weight and have a larger propensity for excess gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention. Methods: In this pilot study, 40 postpartum women credentialed to receive postpartum women, infants, and children (WIC) service were randomized to usual care ("WIC Moms") or a personalized health intervention delivered via a SmartPhone ("E‐Moms"). Assessments, including body weight, vital signs, circumferences, and body composition, were completed at week 0 (6‐8 weeks postpartum), week 8, and week 16. Results: Results are presented as change from week 0 at 16. As per the completers analysis, body weight change was not different between the groups (WIC Moms vs. E‐Moms; 1.8 +/‐ 0.9 vs. ‐0.1 +/‐ 0.9 kg; p = 0.10), neither was the change in percent body fat (1.7 +/‐ 0.6 vs. 0.1% +/‐ 0.6%; p = 0.90) or waist/hip ratio (‐0.01 +/‐ 0.01 vs. ‐0.02 +/‐ 0.01 cm; p = 0.60). However, due to notable variability in intervention adherence as the study progressed, participants were classified post hoc as having low (<40% adherence), medium (40%‐70% adherence), or high adherence (>70% adherence). Participants with high intervention adherence (n = 5) had a significant reduction in body weight (‐3.6 +/‐ 1.6 vs. 1.8 +/‐ 0.9 kg; p = 0.005) and percent body fat (‐2.5 +/‐ 1.0 vs. 1.7% +/‐ 0.6%; p = 0.001) when compared to WIC Moms. Conclusions: Overall, the E‐Moms intervention was not able to decrease postpartum weight retention in women receiving WIC benefits compared to usual care received through the current WIC program. However, there is some evidence to suggest improved adherence to the intervention would improve weight management. Copyright © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health advice is useful for establishing behavioural changes, but such changes tend not to last. It would therefore be good to identify mechanisms for reinforcing advice and one option is the use of information and communication technologies. Given the limited evidence on the effectiveness of such technologies, we decided to conduct a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a mobile application (app) for supporting the provision health advice for weight loss. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial with 110 obese and overweight patients from the Basque public health care network (Araba). Patients were randomly allocated to the control (health advice) or intervention (health advice + app) groups. Primary (weight) and secondary (blood cholesterol level, blood pressure, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and adherence to dietary and exercise recommendations) outcome variables were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months after the end of the intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in weight (0.357 kg; P = 0.7), blood cholesterol (2.6 mg/dl; P = 0.617), blood pressure (2.3 mmHg; P = 0.369) or adherence to recommendations on diet (84.6% in control and 92.9% the intervention group, P = 0.413) or physical activity (56% in controls and 75% the intervention group, P = 0.145). On the other hand, there were significant differences in HbA1c in favour of the control group (‐0.095%; %; P = 0.046). DISCUSSION: The use of AKTIDIET® to support health advice for weight loss cannot be recommended. More high quality studies are needed, and patients should be involved in the design of apps to increase their efficacy and usability. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02308176.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit and vegetable consumption is important for health, but many individuals fail to consume adequate amounts for health benefits. Although many individuals are aware of current fruit and vegetable consumption recommendations, research suggests that adherence to these is hampered by low knowledge of the details of these recommendations. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the development and details of a pilot randomized controlled test of a novel interactive mobile phone app for addressing low knowledge of the UK 5‐a‐day fruit and vegetable recommendations. METHODS: Requirements for the app were first defined by researchers and potential end users and prioritized using the MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) method. Second, a prototype mobile phone app was developed using an agile approach. Third, the prototype app was tested in a randomized controlled pilot trial for impacts on knowledge and intake of fruit and vegetables. Volunteers were randomized to either receive (n=50) or not receive the app (n=44) for 2 or 4 weeks, and fruit and vegetable knowledge, intake, and behavior were assessed at the beginning of the study and after 1 and 2 weeks or after 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. App usage and qualitative feedback were also investigated. All findings then informed the development of a final app. RESULTS: Low knowledge of consumption recommendations centered around portion sizes and the need for variety, and an interactive mobile phone app was considered a suitable tool for improving this knowledge in a practical manner that would be available both at time of consumption and outside of these times. The pilot test revealed improved behavior after 2 weeks compared with baseline in volunteers who received the app, but improvements in knowledge on fruit and vegetable recommendations were found in both groups, and no improvements in fruit and vegetable intakes were found in formal measures. Patterns of app usage and qualitative feedback also suggested a number of modifications. The resultant final app incorporates several behavior change techniques (goal‐setting, self‐monitoring, and personalized feedback) as well as aiming to improve knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: A novel interactive mobile phone app was successfully developed based on requirements, and when tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial, this app was found to have some impacts on fruit and vegetable outcomes. Although benefits from the app were small, impacts will likely increase as a result of recent modifications. The final SMART 5‐A‐DAY app is available in the Google Play Store and now needs testing in the target population.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effects of nutrition management application in a mobile device on obesity management of patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Fifty subjects, who were breast cancer survivors, aged 30 years and older, participated in an obesity management program for four weeks. They were divided randomly into two groups: a control group (n = 25) and a treatment group (n = 25). The treatment group was provided an application for nutrition management and diet consultant, while the control group maintained their ordinary life without any nutrition management. RESULTS: The weight of the treatment group decreased by 0.8 kg, but the change was not significant. In contrast, the waist‐hip ratio of the treatment group decreased significantly from 0.75 to 0.71 (p = 0.012). The Nutrition Quotients of the treatment group increased significantly from 61.3 to 69.6 points (p < 0.001), whereas that of the control group decreased significantly from 61.5 to 59.0 (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: This mobile nutrition management application for breast cancer patients is effective in managing obesity and dietary habits. These results can be used as basic information to prepare an obesity management program for breast cancer patients.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile device application (app) for the treatment of urinary incontinence through adherence to home pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and its impact on urinary symptoms. Methods This prospective randomized study included women with stress urinary incontinence. They were randomized into 2 groups: the app group, which used an app developed using the same visual component of electromyography as a guide for PFMT and followed exercises shown on the screen, and the control group, which received written instructions with the same protocol as the app group but without the dynamic sequence of PFMT images. Exercises were done twice a day. Reevaluation was repeated at 1, 2, and 3 months after the initial evaluation. Changes in urinary and vaginal symptoms were evaluated using questionnaires, and the Oxford Modified Scale was determined through digital palpation. Results Twenty‐one women were included in the study (app group, n = 12; control group, n = 09). Adherence (number of repetitions) was higher in the app group at 2 and 3 months after PFMT (P < 0.001), but adherence decrease, especially in the control group, at 1, 2, and 3 months. Vaginal symptoms (P < 0.001), quality of life (P = 0.003), urinary symptoms (P < 0.001), and stress urinary symptoms (P < 0.001) showed improvement comparing baseline and during treatment, but there was no difference between the app and control groups (P values, 0.887, 0.817, 0.573, and 0.825, respectively). Conclusions Using the app increased adherence to PFMT in women with urinary incontinence symptoms and improved subjective perception.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile apps for mental health have the potential to overcome access barriers to mental health care, but there is little information on whether patients use the interventions as intended and the impact they have on mental health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to document and compare use patterns and clinical outcomes across the United States between 3 different self‐guided mobile apps for depression. METHODS: Participants were recruited through Web‐based advertisements and social media and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 mood apps. Treatment and assessment were conducted remotely on each participant's smartphone or tablet with minimal contact with study staff. We enrolled 626 English‐speaking adults (≥18 years old) with mild to moderate depression as determined by a 9‐item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) score ≥5, or if their score on item 10 was ≥2. The apps were (1) Project: EVO, a cognitive training app theorized to mitigate depressive symptoms by improving cognitive control, (2) iPST, an app based on an evidence‐based psychotherapy for depression, and (3) Health Tips, a treatment control. Outcomes were scores on the PHQ‐9 and the Sheehan Disability Scale. Adherence to treatment was measured as number of times participants opened and used the apps as instructed. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 211 participants to iPST, 209 to Project: EVO, and 206 to Health Tips. Among the participants, 77.0% (482/626) had a PHQ‐9 score >10 (moderately depressed). Among the participants using the 2 active apps, 57.9% (243/420) did not download their assigned intervention app but did not differ demographically from those who did. Differential treatment effects were present in participants with baseline PHQ‐9 score >10, with the cognitive training and problem‐solving apps resulting in greater effects on mood than the information control app (χ22=6.46, P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: Mobile apps for depression appear to have their greatest impact on people with more moderate levels of depression. In particular, an app that is designed to engage cognitive correlates of depression had the strongest effect on depressed mood in this sample. This study suggests that mobile apps reach many people and are useful for more moderate levels of depression.

AB  - Background: Osteoarthritis is a common disease and one of the most important causes of disability in the elderly that negatively affect the quality of their life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile app‐based‐instruction in improving physical performance of female patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: The present study was a randomized clinical trial. The sample included 64 female patients (40 to 70�years old) with knee osteoarthritis in Bojnurd city in 2018. They were selected from the available patients that were randomly divided into comparison and intervention groups. Before the intervention, demographic information questionnaire, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire, and 36‐item short‐form health survey (SF‐36) were employed to elicit data on demographic information, arthritis condition and health status of the participants. Intervention lasted for a period of two months for each group. Intervention group received mobile‐app‐based instruction coupled with routine cares, while comparison group just received the routine cares. After the intervention both groups were evaluated again in terms of arthritis condition and health status using the same scales. Results: After the intervention, significant differences were found between the intervention and comparison groups in terms of overall WOMAC score (p = 0.005), pain aspect of WOMAC (p = 0.005), physical function aspect of WOMAC (p = 0.005), physical function aspect of SF‐36 (p ? 0.05), and vitality aspect of SF‐36 (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The use of mobile‐app‐based instruction can enhance the physical function and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Trial registration The research project was registered at Iranian Registry of�Clinical�Trials (IRCT20161208031300N2).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the efficacy of app-based interventions designed to support medication adherence and investigate which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used by the apps are associated with efficacy. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with meta-analysis. SETTING: Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase and Web of Science were searched from 1990 to November 2018 for RCTs conducted in any healthcare setting. PARTICIPANTS: Studies of participants of any age taking prescribed medication for any health condition and for any duration. INTERVENTION: An app-based intervention delivered through a smartphone, tablet computer or personal digital assistant to help, support or advise about medication adherence. COMPARATOR: One of (1) usual care, (2) a control app which did not use any BCTs to improve medication adherence or (3) a non-app-based comparator. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pooled effect size of changes in medication adherence. The secondary outcome was the association between BCTs used by the apps and the effect size. RESULTS: The initial search identified 13 259 citations. After title and abstract screening, full-text articles of 83 studies were screened for eligibility. Nine RCTs with 1159 recruited participants were included. The mean age of participants was >50 years in all but one study. Health conditions of target populations included cardiovascular disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, psoriasis and multimorbidity. The meta-analysis indicated that patients who use mobile apps to support them in taking medications are more likely to self-report adherence to medications (OR 2.120, 95% CI 1.635 to 2.747, n=988) than those in the comparator groups. Meta-regression of the BCTs did not reveal any significant associations with effect size. CONCLUSIONS: App-based medication adherence interventions may have a positive effect on patient adherence. Larger scale studies are required to further evaluate this effect, including long-term sustainability, and intervention and participant characteristics that are associated with efficacy and app usage.

AB  - Excessive uninterrupted sitting, also known as sedentary behavior, has been detrimentally associated with several health outcomes. However, the general population is often unaware of these health risks. Mobile phone technology offers great potential to increase awareness and to initiate behavior change. This study examined the short‐term effects of stAPP, a smartphone‐based intervention, on prolonged sitting behavior. Fifty‐eight participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (IG, n = 31) or a control group (CG, n = 27). After 1 week of baseline assessment, the IG received stAPP (i.e. smartphone, smartphone app and corresponding motion sensor) and used it during the following week. CG participants were monitored during 2 weeks without receiving stAPP. Total daily sitting time and prolonged sitting bouts (>30 min bouts of sitting) were objectively assessed using activPAL3 inclinometers. Although no significant changes emerged in the CG in any of the sitting parameters, total sitting time (on weekdays; p = 0.032), number of prolonged sitting bouts (>30 min of sitting) [both on week‐ (p < 0.001) and weekend days (p = 0.008)] and average duration of prolonged sitting bouts [both on week‐ (p = 0.004) and weekend days (p = 0.029)] decreased significantly in the IG. The stAPP smartphone‐based intervention constitutes a promising intervention tool to interrupt and reduce prolonged sitting behavior. Further long‐term studies on a larger scale are needed to further explore the effectiveness of a smartphone‐based intervention aimed at reducing prolonged sitting behavior.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effect of a mobile app treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. METHODS: Randomized controlled trial, conducted 2013‐2014 in Sweden. Community‐dwelling adult women with >1 SUI episode/week recruited through our website and randomized to app treatment (n=62) or control group (postponed treatment, n=61). One participant from each group was lost to follow‐up. Intervention was the mobile app Tat with a treatment program focused on pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), and information about SUI and lifestyle factors. Primary outcomes, 3 months after randomization: symptom severity (International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire Urinary Incontinence Short Form [ICIQ‐UI SF]); and condition‐specific quality of life (ICIQ Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life [ICIQ‐LUTSqol]). RESULTS: One hundred and twenty‐three women were included (mean age 44.7), with moderate/severe SUI (97.5%, 120/123), mean ICIQ‐UI SF score 11.1 (SD 2.8) and mean ICIQ‐LUTSqol score 34.4 (SD 6.1) at baseline. At follow‐up, the app group reported improvements in symptom severity (mean ICIQ‐UI SF score reduction: 3.9, 95% confidence interval 3.0‐4.7) and condition‐specific quality of life (mean ICIQ‐LUTSqol score reduction: 4.8, 3.4‐6.2) and the groups were significantly different (mean ICIQ‐UI SF score difference: ‐3.2, ‐4.3to ‐2.1; mean ICIQ‐LUTSqol score difference: ‐4.6, ‐7.8 to ‐1.4). In the app group, 98.4% (60/61) performed PFMT at follow‐up, and 41.0% (25/61) performed it daily. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile app treatment was effective for women with SUI and yielded clinically relevant improvements. This app may increase access to first‐line treatment and adherence to PFMT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a progressive chronic disease affecting 6.5 million Americans and over 15 million individuals globally. Patients with HF are required to engage in complex self-care behaviors. Although the advancements in medicine have enabled people with HF to live longer, they often have poor health-related quality of life and experience severe and frequent symptoms that limit several aspects of their lives. Mobile phone apps have not only created new and interactive ways of communication between patients and health care providers but also provide a platform to enhance adherence to self-care management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of a newly developed mobile app (HeartMapp) in improving self-care behaviors and quality of life of patients with HF and to calculate effect sizes for sample size calculation for a larger study. METHODS: This was a pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial. Participants were enrolled in the hospital before discharge and followed at home for 30 days. The intervention group used HeartMapp (n=9), whereas the control group (n=9) received HF education. These apps were downloaded onto their mobile phones for daily use. RESULTS: A total of 72% (13/18) participants completed the study; the mean age of the participants was 53 (SD 4.02) years, 56% (10/18) were females, 61% (11/18) lived alone, 33% (6/18) were African Americans, and 61% (11/18) used mobile phone to get health information. The mean engagement with HeartMapp was 78%. Results were promising with a trend that participants in the HeartMapp group had a significant mean score change on self-care management (8.7 vs 2.3; t3.38=11, P=.01), self-care confidence (6.7 vs 1.8; t2.53=11, P=.28), and HF knowledge (3 vs -0.66; t2.37=11, P=.04. Depression improved among both groups, more so in the control group (-1.14 vs -5.17; t1.97=11, P=.07). Quality of life declined among both groups, more so in the control group (2.14 vs 9.0; t-1.43=11, P=.18). CONCLUSIONS: The trends demonstrated in this pilot feasibility study warrant further exploration on the use of HeartMapp to improve HF outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Pilot study, no funding from National agencies, hence not registered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are 4 main types of chronic or noncommunicable diseases. Of these, diabetes is one of the major therapeutic concerns globally. Moreover, Iran is among the countries with the highest incidence of diabetic patients. Furthermore, library-based studies by researchers have shown that thus far no study has been carried out to evaluate the relationship between Web-based diabetic personal health records (DPHR) and self-care indicators in Iran. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of Web-based DPHR on self-care status of diabetic patients in an intervention group as compared with a control group. METHODS: The effect of DPHR on self-care was assessed by using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) protocol for a 2-arm parallel group with a 1:1 allocation ratio. During a 4-month trial period, the control group benefited from the routine care; the intervention group additionally had access to the Web-based DPHR app besides routine care. During the trial, 2 time points at baseline and postintervention were used to evaluate the impact of the DPHR app. A sample size of 72 people was randomly and equally assigned to both the control and intervention groups. The primary outcome measure was the self-care status of the participants. RESULTS: Test results showed that the self-care status in the intervention group in comparison with the control group had a significant difference. In addition, the dimensions of self-care, including normal values, changes trend, the last measured value, and the last time measured values had a significant difference while other dimensions had no significant difference. Furthermore, we found no correlation between Web-based DPHR system and covariates, including scores of weight, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum creatinine, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol, and planned visit adherence, as well as the change trend of mean for blood glucose and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: We found that as a result of the Web-based DPHR app, the self-care scores in the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group. In total, we found no correlation between the Web-based DPHR app and covariates, including planned visit adherence, HbA1c, serum creatinine, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, weight, and the change trend of mean for blood glucose and blood pressure.

AB  - Introduction: New app‐based programs for postoperative rehabilitation have been developed, but no long‐term study has been published to date. Thus, a prospective randomized control trial with 2‐year follow‐up was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of app‐based rehabilitation (GenuSport) compared to a control group after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Methods: Between April and October 2016, 60 patients were enrolled in the study. Twenty‐five patients were lost to follow‐up, leaving 35 patients undergoing TKA for inclusion. In this group, twenty patients received app‐based exercise program and 15 were randomized to the control group. The mean age was 64.37 ± 9.32 years with a mean follow‐up of 23.51 ± 1.63 months. Patients in the app group underwent an app‐based knee training starting on the day of surgery; whereas, patients in the control group underwent regular physiotherapy. Functional outcome scores using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS) and VAS of pain were analyzed. Results: In the short term, significant differences between the app group and control group in time of 10‐m walk (19.66 ± 7.80 vs. 27.08 ± 15.46 s; p = 0.029), VAS pain at rest and activity (2.65 ± 0.82 vs. 3.57 ± 1.58, respectively 4.03 ± 1.26 vs. 5.05 ± 1.21; p < 0.05) were observed. In the long term, a variety of different tendencies was found, highest in KSS Function with 76.32 ± 16.49 (app group) vs. 67.67 ± 16.57 (control group) (p = 0.130). Additionally, patients in the app group required less painkillers (10.0% vs. 26.7%) and more likely to participate in sports (65.0% vs. 53.3%). Conclusions: An app‐based knee trainer is a promising tool in improving functional outcomes such as KSS function score and VAS after TKA. Level of evidence: Level II, prospective randomized control trial.

AB  - The study examined whether exposure to the mobile application (app) called PTSD Coach decreased symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a sample of Veterans. The study was online through Qualtrics and participants were primarily recruited through a university's Veteran's Listserv in Anchorage, Alaska. Veterans who had access to a device (smartphone, tablet, etc.) that allowed use of the mobile application and met inclusion criteria participated (N = 27). The study was true-experimental where random assignment to a (1) no treatment or a (2) treatment group was conducted. Participants self-reported on the severity of symptoms of PTSD using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) across three time points (baseline, 30 days, and 60 days). Participants in the treatment group received a brief introduction to the mobile app and were asked to use the app for 60 days. In addition, participants in the treatment group answered surveys on the utilization and on feedback of the PTSD Coach. Hypotheses were that PTSD symptoms correlate positively with the minutes used per day, days used per week, and total time spent using PTSD Coach mobile app after 30 and after 60 days. Moreover, hypotheses were that participants' differed in scores of PTSD between treatment groups. Results with bootstrapping showed that symptoms of PTSD as they related to the use of the PTSD Coach were not correlated at 30 or 60 days. Furthermore, the treatment groups did not differ on PTSD scores at 30 or 60 days. Results on feedback of the PTSD Coach showed that participants overall enjoyed the app, found it easy to use, and it was important that the app was discrete. Limitations and directions for future research were discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a self‐regulation smartphone app for reducing prolonged sitting in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This was a two‐arm, randomised, controlled feasibility trial. The intervention group used the MyHealthAvatar‐Diabetes smartphone app for 8 weeks. The app uses a number of behaviour change techniques aimed at reducing and breaking up sitting time. Eligibility, recruitment, retention, and completion rates for the outcomes (sitting, standing, stepping, and health‐related measures) assessed trial feasibility. Interviews with participants explored intervention acceptability. Participants with T2DM were randomised to the control (n = 10) and intervention groups (n = 10). Recruitment and retention rates were 71% and 90%, respectively. The remaining participants provided 100% of data for the study measures. The MyHealthAvatar‐Diabetes app was viewed as acceptable for reducing and breaking up sitting time. There were preliminary improvements in the number of breaks in sitting per day, body fat %, glucose tolerance, attitude, intention, planning, wellbeing, and positive and negative affect in favour of the intervention group. In conclusion, the findings indicate that it would be feasible to deliver and evaluate the efficacy of the MyHealthAvatar‐Diabetes app for breaking up sitting time and improving health outcomes in a full trial.

AB  - Many smartphone applications (apps) for mental health (MHapps) are available to the public. However, few have been the subject of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and the change processes that are hypothesized to mediate claimed effects have not been previously studied. This RCT compared the efficacy of three publicly available MHapps to a waitlist control condition in a community sample, in which no MHapp was provided. The three MHapps included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) toolkit app MoodKit, mood tracking app MoodPrism, and CBT strategy app MoodMission. Participants were randomly allocated to each condition, completed a baseline assessment, downloaded their allocated MHapp, and completed a second assessment 30 days later, with n = 226 included in final analyses (81% female; M age = 34 years). Compared to the control condition, all MHapp groups experienced increases in mental wellbeing, MoodKit and MoodMission groups experienced decreases in depression, and no groups experienced effects on anxiety. Mediated regressions revealed that increasing coping self‐efficacy, rather than emotional self‐awareness or mental health literacy, was the underlying process contributing to effects on mental health for all three MHapps. MHapps appear to be an effective solution for improving public mental health, notably by improving users’ confidence in their ability to cope.

AB  - BACKGROUND: General health promoting campaigns are often not targeted at the people who need them the most. Web‐ and app‐based tools are a new way to reach, motivate, and help people with poor health status. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to test a Web‐ and mobile app‐based tool ("SoSu‐life") on employees in the social welfare and health care sector in Denmark. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was carried out as a workplace intervention. The tool was designed to help users make healthy lifestyle changes such as losing weight, exercise more, and quit smoking. A team competition between the participating workplaces took place during the first 16 weeks of the intervention. Twenty nursing homes for elderly people in 6 municipalities in Denmark participated in the study. The employees at the nursing homes were randomized either 1:1 or 2:1 on a municipality level to use the SoSu‐life tool or to serve as a control group with no intervention. All participants underwent baseline measurements including body weight, waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol level and they filled in a questionnaire covering various aspects of health. The participants were measured again after 16 and 38 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 566 (SoSu‐life: n=355, control: n=211) participants were included in the study. At 16 weeks there were 369 participants still in the study (SoSu‐life: n=227, control: n=142) and 269 participants completed the 38 week intervention (SoSu‐life: n=152, control: n=117). At 38 weeks, the SoSu‐life group had a larger decrease in body weight (‐1.01 kg, P=.03), body fat percentage (‐0.8%, P=.03), and waist circumference (‐1.8 cm, P=.007) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The SoSu‐life Web‐ and app‐based tool had a modest yet beneficial effect on body weight and body fat percentage in the health care sector staff.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Home‐based noninvasive ventilation has proven cost‐effective. But, adherence to therapy still constitutes a common clinical problem. We hypothesized that a behavioral intervention supported by a mobile health (mHealth) app could enhance patient self‐efficacy. It is widely accepted that mHealth‐supported services can enhance productive interactions among the stakeholders involved in home‐based respiratory therapies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to measure changes in self‐efficacy in patients with chronic respiratory failure due to diverse etiologies during a 3‐month follow‐up period after the intervention. Ancillary objectives were assessment of usability and acceptability of the mobile app as well as its potential contribution to collaborative work among stakeholders. METHODS: A single‐blind, single‐center, randomized controlled trial was conducted between February 2019 and June 2019 with 67 adult patients with chronic respiratory failure undergoing home‐based noninvasive ventilation. In the intervention group, a psychologist delivered a face‐to‐face motivational intervention. Follow‐up was supported by a mobile app that allowed patients to report the number of hours of daily noninvasive ventilation use and problems with the therapy. Advice was automatically delivered by the mobile app in case of a reported problem. The control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the change in the Self Efficacy in Sleep Apnea questionnaire score. Secondary outcomes included app usability, app acceptability, continuity of care, person‐centered care, and ventilatory parameters. RESULTS: Self‐efficacy was not significantly different in the intervention group after the intervention (before: mean 3.4, SD 0.6; after: mean 3.4, SD 0.5, P=.51). No changes were observed in adherence to therapy nor quality of life. Overall, the mHealth tool had a good usability score (mean 78 points) and high acceptance rate (mean score of 7.5/10 on a Likert scale). It was considered user‐friendly (mean score of 8.2/10 on a Likert scale) and easy to use without assistance (mean score of 8.5/10 on a Likert scale). Patients also scored the perception of continuity of care and person‐centered care as high. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated care intervention supported by the mobile app did not improve patient self‐management. However, the high acceptance of the mobile app might indicate potential for enhanced communication among stakeholders. The study identified key elements required for mHealth tools to provide effective support to collaborative work and personalized care.

AB  - CONTEXT: Exacerbated by life stressors, fatigue is the most common symptom for people living with HIV. OBJECTIVE: To adapt, develop, and assess the feasibility of a Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management Mobile Health (CBSM mHealth) application (app) for HIV‐related fatigue. METHODS: This study had two phases: app development with key informants (N = 5) and a randomized controlled trial (N = 30). Patients randomized to the intervention group completed 10 weekly CBSM modules; those in the control group received a generic healthy lifestyle app. Measures included HIV‐related fatigue, depression, anxiety, stressful life events, CD4 count, HIV viral load, credibility and acceptability of the intervention, and barriers to treatment participation. RESULTS: We were able to recruit participants for this study, and they were able to complete the required measures. They found the intervention to be credible and acceptable and reported few barriers to treatment participation. The direction of change in the primary outcome, a decrease in fatigue, is in the expected direction and provides evidence of the promise of the intervention, which still needs to be tested in an adequately powered trial. For completers (randomized to the intervention group and completed at least 80% of the modules), there were significant changes (95% CI; lower scores indicate improvement) in fatigue intensity (from 64.2 to 59.7) and overall fatigue‐related functioning (from 6.6 to 4.2). CONCLUSION: We have proof of concept as to the feasibility, acceptability, and initial signals of efficacy for an mHealth intervention to help people with HIV‐related fatigue better cope with stress and reduce their fatigue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital mobile technology presents a promising medium for reaching young adults with smoking cessation interventions because they are the heaviest users of this technology. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of an evidence-informed smartphone app for smoking cessation, Crush the Crave (CTC), on reducing smoking prevalence among young adult smokers in comparison with an evidence-informed self-help guide, On the Road to Quitting (OnRQ). METHODS: A parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with 2 arms was conducted in Canada to evaluate CTC. In total, 1599 young adult smokers (aged 19 to 29 years) intending to quit smoking in the next 30 days were recruited online and randomized to receive CTC or the control condition OnRQ for a period of 6 months. The primary outcome measure was self-reported continuous abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Overall follow-up rates were 57.41% (918/1599) and 60.48% (967/1599) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Moreover, 45.34% (725/1599) of participants completed baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Intention-to-treat analysis (last observation carried forward) showed that continuous abstinence (N=1599) at 6 months was not significantly different at 7.8% (64/820) for CTC versus 9.2% (72/779) for OnRQ (odds ratio; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59-1.18). Similarly, 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 6 months was not significantly different at 14.4% (118/820) and 16.9% (132/779) for CTC and OnRQ, respectively (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.63-1.08). However, these rates of abstinence were favorable compared with unassisted 30-day quit rates of 11.5% among young adults. Secondary measures of quit attempts and the number of cigarettes smoked per day at 6-month follow-up did not reveal any significant differences between groups. For those who completed the 6-month follow-up, 85.1% (359/422) of young adult smokers downloaded CTC as compared with 81.8% (346/423) of OnRQ, chi<sup>2</sup><sub>1(N=845)</sub>=1.6, P=.23. Furthermore, OnRQ participants reported significantly higher levels of overall satisfaction (mean 3.3 [SD 1.1] vs mean 2.6 [SD 1.3]; t<sub>644</sub>=6.87, P<.001), perceived helpfulness (mean 5.8 [SD 2.4] vs mean 4.3 [SD 2.6], t<sub>657</sub>=8.0, P<.001), and frequency of use (mean 3.6 [SD 1.2] vs mean 3.2 [SD 1.1], t<sub>683</sub>=5.7, P<.001) compared with CTC participants. CONCLUSIONS: CTC was feasible for delivering cessation support but was not superior to a self-help guide in helping motivated young adults to quit smoking. CTC will benefit from further formative research to address satisfaction and usage. As smartphone apps may not serve as useful alternatives to printed self-help guides, there is a need to conduct further research to understand how digital mobile technology smoking cessation interventions for smoking cessation can be improved.

AB  - Objective: Investigate the effectiveness of Concussion Coach, an interactive smartphone application, as a treatment for residual neurobehavioral symptoms and distress in Veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI). Methods: Veterans with mild TBI were randomized to Concussion Coach (n = 238) or Treatment‐as‐Usual (TAU) (n = 241) in a 3‐month randomized controlled trial. Primary outcome measures included postconcussive symptom (PCS) severity as measured by the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI), and psychological distress as measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory‐18 (BSI‐18). Measures of self‐efficacy, social support, and comfort with technology were administered as potential moderators and mediators. An intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis was performed (N = 461: Concussion Coach = 231 and TAU = 230) using Bayesian Network (BN)modeling. Results: The probability of decreased PCS severity was significantly greater for those assigned to Concussion Coach, .35 [.32,.37], than for TAU, .29 (.27, .32), with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.29. Also, Concussion Coach showed a significantly greater probability of increased self‐efficacy (.36 [.32, .39]) than did TAU (.28 [.25, .30], OR = 1.42). In turn, self‐efficacy (increased vs. decreased) showed a significantly greater probability of decreased PCS severity (.51 [.47, .54] vs. .27 [.24, .30], OR = 2.71) and decreased psychological distress (.53 [.49, .56] vs. .32 [.29, .35], OR = 2.35), suggesting that self‐efficacy may have mediated Concussion Coach effects. Conclusions: Concussion Coach is effective at reducing PCS severity and psychological distress. Increased self‐efficacy/perception of self‐management of symptoms may be key to successful treatment of residual symptoms in those with history of concussion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High positive mental health, including the ability to cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and be able to contribute to one's community, has been associated with various health outcomes. The role of positive mental health is therefore increasingly recognized in national mental health promotion programs and policies. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be a cost‐effective way to disseminate positive psychological interventions to the general population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of a fully automated mHealth intervention on positive mental health, and anxiety and depression symptomology among Swedish university students using a randomized controlled trial design. METHODS: A 2‐arm, single‐blind (researchers), parallel‐groups randomized controlled trial with an mHealth positive psychology program intervention group and a relevant online mental health information control group was employed to estimate the effect of the novel intervention. Participants were recruited using digital advertising through student health care centers in Sweden. Inclusion criteria were (1) university students, (2) able to read and understand Swedish, (3) and have access to a mobile phone. Exclusion criteria were high positive mental health, as assessed by the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC‐SF), or high depression and anxiety symptomology, as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome was positive mental health (MHC‐SF), and the secondary outcomes were depression and anxiety symptomatology (HADS). The subscales of MHC‐SF were also analyzed as exploratory outcomes. Outcomes were measured 3 months after randomization through questionnaires completed on the participants' mobile phones. RESULTS: A total of 654 participants (median age 25 years), including 510 (78.0%) identifying as female, were randomized to either the intervention (n=348) or control group (n=306). At follow‐up, positive mental health was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.067, 95% CI 1.024‐1.112, P=.002). For both depression and anxiety symptomatology, the intervention group showed significantly lower scores at follow‐up compared with the control group (depression: IRR=0.820, 95% CI 0.714‐0.942, P=.005; anxiety: IRR=0.899, 95% CI 0.840‐0.962, P=.002). Follow‐up rates were lower than expected (58.3% for primary outcomes and 52.3% for secondary outcomes); however, attrition analyses did not identify any systematic attrition with respect to baseline variables. CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth intervention was estimated to be superior to usual care in increasing positive mental health among university students. A protective effect of the intervention was also found on depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using an automated mobile phone format to enhance positive mental health, which offers promise for the use of mHealth solutions in public mental health promotion.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity treatment is less successful for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, particularly when delivered in primary care. Digital health strategies can extend the reach of clinical obesity treatments to care settings serving patients at highest risk. METHODS: Track was an effectiveness RCT of a 12‐month digital weight‐loss intervention, embedded within a community health center system. Participants were 351 adult patients (aged 21‐65 years) with obesity and hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Patients were randomized to usual care (n=175) or an intervention (n=176) comprising app‐based self‐monitoring of behavior change goals with tailored feedback, a smart scale, dietitian‐delivered counseling calls, and clinician counseling informed by app‐generated recommendations, delivered via electronic health record. The primary outcome was 12‐month weight change. Randomization began on June 18, 2013, final assessments were completed on September 10, 2015. Data analysis was conducted in 2016 and 2017. The trial retained 92% of usual care and 96% of intervention participants at 12 months. RESULTS: The Track intervention produced larger weight losses relative to usual care at 6 months (net effect: ‐4.4 kg, 95% CI= ‐5.5, ‐3.3, p<0.001) and 12 months (net effect: ‐3.8 kg, 95% CI= ‐5.0, ‐2.5, p<0.001). Intervention participants were more likely to lose ≥5% of their baseline weight at 6 months (43% vs 6%, p<0.001) and 12 months (40% vs 17%, p<0.001). Intervention participants completing ≥80% of expected self‐monitoring episodes (‐3.5 kg); counseling calls (‐3.0 kg); or self‐weighing days (‐4.4 kg) lost significantly more weight than less engaged intervention participants (all p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A digital obesity treatment, integrated with health system resources, can produce clinically meaningful weight‐loss outcomes among socioeconomically disadvantaged primary care patients with elevated cardiovascular disease risk.

AB  - Objective: Body dissatisfaction rates continue to remain high and the consequences remain dire, especially among young women. One sociocultural factor found to contribute to body dissatisfaction is media use. Traditional media literacy interventions have found some success in decreasing body image-related constructs, though are limited in their reach and are often quickly outdated. This study developed and examined a media literacy intervention delivered via a smartphone app designed to help college women disrupt connection between media use and body dissatisfaction and negative affect.Method: Participants included 94 University of Hawai'i students, randomly assigned to the intervention group, the app-based control group, or the traditional control group. Participants using the app received 5 prompts per day for 15 days. The app-based control group self-monitored while the intervention group both self-monitored and received prompts providing psychoeducation and activities designed to increase media literacy. Assessment measures were collected at baseline and again 15 days later. Results: The intervention produced significant improvements in the intervention group compared to the control group on measures of fatigue. There were also overall reductions over time in general negative affect, fear, sadness, guilt, hostility, shyness, general positive affect, joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness, serenity and critical thinking about media messages that were not specific to condition. Feedback questions gathered at follow-up from the intervention group showed that participants rated the intervention as acceptable. Additionally, participants endorsed learning more about the link between the media ideals and body image. Discussion: This study provides evidence in support of the feasibility of delivering a media literacy intervention via a smartphone application. Participation in the study found significant decreases in types of affect, such as general negative affect, general positive affect, and sadness from baseline to post-intervention. However, there may be potential for greater change. Study limitations such as power and challenges with the smartphone application are discussed. Future directions related to the creation of digital interventions are discussed. Overall, participants rated the intervention as acceptable, opening the door for future research in which the intervention and its delivery system are improved, and its efficacy is reexamined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly prevalent and significantly affects the daily functioning of patients. Self‐management strategies, including increasing physical activity, can help people with COPD have better health and a better quality of life. Digital mobile health (mHealth) techniques have the potential to aid the delivery of self‐management interventions for COPD. We developed an mHealth intervention (Self‐Management supported by Assistive, Rehabilitative, and Telehealth technologies‐COPD [SMART‐COPD]), delivered via a smartphone app and an activity tracker, to help people with COPD maintain (or increase) physical activity after undertaking pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using the SMART‐COPD intervention for the self‐management of physical activity and to explore the feasibility of conducting a future randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate its effectiveness. METHODS: We conducted a randomized feasibility study. A total of 30 participants with COPD were randomly allocated to receive the SMART‐COPD intervention (n=19) or control (n=11). Participants used SMART‐COPD throughout PR and for 8 weeks afterward (ie, maintenance) to set physical activity goals and monitor their progress. Questionnaire‐based and physical activity‐based outcome measures were taken at baseline, the end of PR, and the end of maintenance. Participants, and health care professionals involved in PR delivery, were interviewed about their experiences with the technology. RESULTS: Overall, 47% (14/30) of participants withdrew from the study. Difficulty in using the technology was a common reason for withdrawal. Participants who completed the study had better baseline health and more prior experience with digital technology, compared with participants who withdrew. Participants who completed the study were generally positive about the technology and found it easy to use. Some participants felt their health had benefitted from using the technology and that it assisted them in achieving physical activity goals. Activity tracking and self‐reporting were both found to be problematic as outcome measures of physical activity for this study. There was dissatisfaction among some control group members regarding their allocation. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth shows promise in helping people with COPD self‐manage their physical activity levels. mHealth interventions for COPD self‐management may be more acceptable to people with prior experience of using digital technology and may be more beneficial if used at an earlier stage of COPD. Simplicity and usability were more important for engagement with the SMART‐COPD intervention than personalization; therefore, the intervention should be simplified for future use. Future evaluation will require consideration of individual factors and their effect on mHealth efficacy and use; within‐subject comparison of step count values; and an opportunity for control group participants to use the intervention if an RCT were to be carried out. Sample size calculations for a future evaluation would need to consider the high dropout rates.

AB  - Smartphone‐based virtual reality (VR) applications (apps) might help to counter low utilization rates of available treatments for fear of heights. Demonstration of effectiveness in real‐life situations of such apps is crucial, but lacking so far. Objective of this study was to develop a stand‐alone, smartphone‐based VR exposure app—Easy Heights—and to test its effectiveness in a real‐life situation. We performed a single‐blind, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. We recruited 70 participants with fear of heights, aged 18–60 years. Primary outcome was performance in a real‐life Behavioral Avoidance Test (BAT) on a lookout tower after a single 1‐h app use (phase 1) and after additional repeated (6 × 30 min) app use at home (phase 2). After phase 2, but not phase 1, participants in the Easy Heights condition showed significantly higher BAT scores compared to participants in the control condition (Cohen’s d = 1.3, p = 0.0001). Repeated use of our stand‐alone, smartphone‐based VR exposure app reduces avoidance behavior and fear, providing a low‐threshold treatment for fear of heights.

AB  - Objective: mHealth approaches that use mobile phones to deliver interventions can help improve access to care for people with serious mental illness. The goal was to evaluate how mHealth performs against more traditional treatment. Methods: A three‐month randomized controlled trial was conducted of a smartphone‐delivered intervention (FOCUS) versus a clinic‐based group intervention (Wellness Recovery Action Plan [WRAP]). Participants were 163 clients, mostly from racial minority groups and with long‐term, serious mental illness (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 49%; bipolar disorder, 28%; and major depressive disorder, 23%). Outcomes were engagement throughout the intervention; satisfaction posttreatment (three months); and improvement in clinical symptoms, recovery, and quality of life (assessed at baseline, posttreatment, and six months). Results: Participants assigned to FOCUS were more likely than those assigned to WRAP to commence treatment (90% versus 58%) and remain fully engaged in eight weeks of care (56% versus 40%). Satisfaction ratings were comparably high for both interventions. Participants in both groups improved significantly and did not differ in clinical outcomes, including general psychopathology and depression. Significant improvements in recovery were seen for the WRAP group posttreatment, and significant improvements in recovery and quality of life were seen for the FOCUS group at six months. Conclusions: Both interventions produced significant gains among clients with serious and persistent mental illnesses who were mostly from racial minority groups. The mHealth intervention showed superior patient engagement and produced patient satisfaction and clinical and recovery outcomes that were comparable to those from a widely used clinic‐based group intervention for illness management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An extraordinary increase in mobile phone ownership has revolutionized the opportunities to use mobile health approaches in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Ecological momentary assessment and intervention (EMAI) uses mobile technology to gather data and deliver timely, personalized behavior change interventions in an individual's natural setting. To our knowledge, there have been no previous trials of EMAI in sub-Saharan Africa. OBJECTIVE: To advance the evidence base for mobile health (mHealth) interventions in LMICs, we conduct a pilot randomized trial to assess the feasibility of EMAI and establish estimates of the potential effect of EMAI on a range of health-related behaviors in Rakai, Uganda. METHODS: This prospective, parallel-group, randomized pilot trial compared health behaviors between adult participants submitting ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data and receiving behaviorally responsive interventional health messaging (EMAI) with those submitting EMA data alone. Using a fully automated mobile phone app, participants submitted daily reports on 5 different health behaviors (fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, and condomless sex with a non-long-term partner) during a 30-day period before randomization (P1). Participants were then block randomized to the control arm, continuing EMA reporting through exit, or the intervention arm, EMA reporting and behavioral health messaging receipt. Participants exited after 90 days of follow-up, divided into study periods 2 (P2: randomization + 29 days) and 3 (P3: 30 days postrandomization to exit). We used descriptive statistics to assess the feasibility of EMAI through the completeness of data and differences in reported behaviors between periods and study arms. RESULTS: The study included 48 participants (24 per arm; 23/48, 48% women; median age 31 years). EMA data collection was feasible, with 85.5% (3777/4418) of the combined days reporting behavioral data. There was a decrease in the mean proportion of days when alcohol was consumed in both arms over time (control: P1, 9.6% of days to P2, 4.3% of days; intervention: P1, 7.2% of days to P3, 2.4% of days). Decreases in sex with a non-long-term partner without a condom were also reported in both arms (P1 to P3 control: 1.9% of days to 1% of days; intervention: 6.6% of days to 1.3% of days). An increase in vegetable consumption was found in the intervention (vegetable: 65.6% of days to 76.6% of days) but not in the control arm. Between arms, there was a significant difference in the change in reported vegetable consumption between P1 and P3 (control: 8% decrease in the mean proportion of days vegetables consumed; intervention: 11.1% increase; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary estimates suggest that EMAI may be a promising strategy for promoting behavior change across a range of behaviors. Larger trials examining the effectiveness of EMAI in LMICs are warranted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04375423; https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04375423.

AB  - Over 70,000 US young adults are diagnosed with cancer annually, disrupting important life transitions and goal pursuits. Hope is a positive psychology construct associated with better quality of life (QOL) that focuses on goal-oriented thinking. We developed and tested Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early life (AWAKE), a scalable 8-week app-based program consisting of educational videos, mood/activity tracking, and telephone-based coaching to promote hope and QOL in young adult cancer survivors (YACS, 18-40 years old). A two-arm RCT was used to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of AWAKE (n = 38) versus attention control (AC; n = 18) among YACS within 2 years of completing treatment and recruited from two NCI-designated cancer centers. Outcomes including hope (Trait Hope Scale), QOL (36-Item Short Form Health Survey; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and substance use were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months. Participants were an average of 32.55 (SD = 5.45) years old; 75.0% were female, and 80.4% White. The most common cancers were breast cancer (28.6%), melanoma (16.1%), and leukemia/lymphoma (12.5%). High retention, engagement, and satisfaction rates were documented in both conditions; AWAKE versus AC participants rated video content as more relevant (p = 0.007) and reported greater likelihood of talking positively about the program (p = 0.005). Many efficacy change scores showed positive trends in AWAKE versus AC. Reorienting to one's goal pursuits after cancer diagnosis and treatment is critical and may be supported through hope-based interventions. Findings suggest that the AWAKE warrants subsequent research testing its efficacy, effectiveness, and scalability. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate levels of physical activity (PA) and good cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with profound health benefits for individuals with mobility disability (MD). Despite the vast amount of research published in the field of PA interventions, little attention has been given to individuals with MD. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of an app‐based versus a supervised exercise and health coaching program to support adults with MD to increase levels of PA, CRF, and improve body composition. METHODS: Participants with self‐perceived MD, aged 18 to 45 years, were included in this 12‐week parallel‐group randomized controlled trial and allocated at random to an app‐based intervention, using commercially available apps‐the Swedish Military training app (FMTK), the Acupedo walking app, and the LogMyFood food photography app‐or a supervised exercise and health coaching intervention, including 1 weekly supervised exercise session and healthy lifestyle coaching. The primary outcome was the level of moderate‐to‐vigorous PA (MVPA) measured with accelerometers. Secondary outcomes included CRF measured by a submaximal test performed on a stationary bicycle and body composition measured by bioelectrical impedance. All outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Linear mixed‐effect models were used to assess the between‐group differences, as well as the within‐group changes through time, in each intervention group. RESULTS: A total of 110 participants with MD were randomized to an app‐based intervention (n=55) or a supervised exercise and health intervention (n=55). The mean age of participants was 34.9 years (SD 6.1), and 81.8% (90/110) of the participants were women. CRF showed a moderate increase in both groups after 12 weeks‐1.07 (95% CI ‐0.14 to 2.27) mL/kg/min increase in the app‐based group and 1.76 (95% CI 0.70 to 2.83) mLkg/min increase in the supervised exercise group. However, the intention‐to‐treat analysis showed no significant differences between the groups in MVPA or CRF after 12 weeks. Waist circumference was significantly lower in the app‐based intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially available apps increased levels of CRF and improved body composition over 12 weeks to the same extent as supervised exercise sessions, showing that both are equally effective. However, neither the app‐based intervention nor the supervised exercise intervention increased MVPA.

AB  - Overconsumption of alcohol, from hazardous to excessive, heavy, and harmful levels, is common among university students. Consenting Swedish students were assigned to one of two smartphone apps offering feedback on estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC; Promillekoll/PartyPlanner) or assessment only (n = 2166; 1:1:1 ratio). App participants with excessive drinking according to public health criteria (>9/>14 drinks/week for women/men, respectively) at a 7 week follow‐up were additionally assigned to the skills‐based TeleCoach app or waitlist (n = 186; 1:1 ratio). All participants were followed at 14 and 20 weeks. At 7 weeks, Promillekoll users showed higher risk of excessive drinking (odds ratio (OR) = 1.83; p â‰¤ 0.01; n = 1558). Students in eBAC app groups with only hazardous use showed fewer binge drinking occasions at 14 weeks and lower eBAC levels up to 20 weeks compared to controls (n = 1157). Also, more highly motivated participants at baseline in both eBAC app groups drank less compared to controls at 7 and 20 weeks. Hidden Markov model analysis revealed a frequent‐heavy drinking group (n = 146; 4.6 days/week, SD = 1.4), where those with access to TeleCoach had fewer drinking days compared to assessment‐only controls (p < 0.001). eBAC apps showed positive effects up to 20 weeks, particularly for motivated students, and a skills‐based app can reduce consumption for those with frequent‐heavy drinking patterns.

AB  - Alcohol is one of the leading risk factors for global disease burden and overconsumption leads to a wide variety of negative consequences in everyday life. Digital interventions have shown small positive effects in contributing to reductions in problematic use. Specific research on smartphone apps is sparse and the few studies published indicate effects ranging from negative or null to small or moderate. TeleCoach™, a web‐based skills training smartphone app, has shown positive effects in non‐treatment‐seeking university students with excessive drinking. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate app effects in a sample of internet help‐seekers from the general population in Sweden. A total of 89 participants were recruited via online advertisement. Following baseline assessment for hazardous use, they were randomized to TeleCoach or a web‐based control app offering brief information and advice regarding problematic alcohol use. The primary outcome was number of standard drinks per week; secondary outcomes included drinking quantity and frequency, binge drinking and blood alcohol count measures as well as app user data and comorbidity related to depression, anxiety, and drug use. Analysis of baseline and 6‐week follow‐up outcomes showed significant within‐group effects on alcohol consumption but no significant between‐group differences. Effect sizes for the within‐group changes in the primary outcome over time were significant [F(1, 55)=43.98; p < 0.001], with a Cohen's d of 1.37 for the intervention group and 0.92 for the control group. This difference in effect sizes indicated that continuation of the study as a large randomized, controlled trial with up to 1,000 participants could be worthwhile.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence of the efficacy of smartphone applications to reduce unhealthy alcohol use. We tested the efficacy of providing access to a smartphone‐based brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol use. METHODS: We conducted a two parallel‐group randomized controlled trial with follow‐up at 6 months, among 977 individuals with an Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test >/=8 and drinking 15 or more drinks/week. Participants were randomized to receive (or not) access to a smartphone application consisting of personalized feedback, risk assessment and self‐monitoring. The primary outcome was the mean number of drinks/week. An intention to treat analysis (ITT) and a per protocol analysis (PP) were conducted. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 34.2(9.8), 46% were female. The baseline mean number of drinks per week was 28.9(16.7). Results differed by type of analysis: ITT: all 977 participants were included in the analysis. Follow‐up rate was 70.7% (n = 691). There was no significant intervention effect: the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) (95%CI) for number of drinks per week was 0.93(0.84; 1.03). PP: 702 participants were included in the analysis. Follow‐up rate was 78.1% (n = 548). There was a significant intervention effect: the IRR for number of drinks per week was 0.88(0.78; 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Providing access to a smartphone‐based brief intervention had no impact on drinking at 6 months and does not appear to be an effective intervention in reducing drinking. Those who downloaded the app appear to benefit from it, nevertheless downloads were limited and further development of similar apps should focus on increasing use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are highly prevalent for the people who are aged between 16 and 25 years and can permanently disrupt the development of these individuals. Easily available mobile health (mHealth) apps for mobile phones have great potential for the prevention and early intervention of mental disorders in young adults, but interventions are required that can help individuals to both identify high‐quality mobile apps and use them to change health and lifestyle behavior. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess the efficacy of a Web‐based self‐guided app recommendation service ("The Toolbox") in improving the well‐being of young Australians aged between 16 and 25 years. The intervention was developed in collaboration with young adults and consists of a curated list of 46 readily available health and well‐being apps, assessed and rated by professionals and young people. Participants are guided by an interactive quiz and subsequently receive recommendations for particular apps to download and use based on their personal goals. METHODS: The study was a waitlist, parallel‐arm, randomized controlled trial. Our primary outcome measure was change in well‐being as measured by the Mental Health Continuum‐Short Form (MHC‐SF). We also employed ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to track mood, energy, rest, and sleep. Participants were recruited from the general Australian population, via several Web‐based and community strategies. The study was conducted through a Web‐based platform consisting of a landing Web page and capabilities to administer study measures at different time points. Web‐based measurements were self‐assessed at baseline and 4 weeks, and EMAs were collected repeatedly at regular weekly intervals or ad hoc when participants interacted with the study platform. Primary outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed‐models and intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 387 participants completed baseline scores and were randomized into the trial. Results demonstrated no significant effect of "The Toolbox" intervention on participant well‐being at 4 weeks compared with the control group (P=.66). There were also no significant differences between the intervention and control groups at 4 weeks on any of the subscales of the MHC‐SF (psychological: P=.95, social: P=.42, emotional: P=.95). Repeat engagement with the study platform resulted in a significant difference in mood, energy, rest, and sleep trajectories between intervention and control groups as measured by EMAs (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study to assess the effectiveness of a Web‐based well‐being intervention in a sample of young adults. The design of the intervention utilized expert rating of existing apps and end‐user codesign approaches resulting in an app recommendation service. Our finding suggests that recommended readily available mental health and well‐being apps may not lead to improvements in the well‐being of a nonclinical sample of young people, but might halt a decline in mood, energy, rest, and sleep.

AB  - Background: Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in the United States (US) and have low rates of HIV/STI testing. Provision of HIV self-testing and STI self-collection can increase testing rates, and access to these kits through mobile applications (apps) could help facilitate YMSM using HIV self-testing and STI self-collection. Methods: Data for this study comes from two pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mobile apps within the Adolescent Trials Network-LYNX and MyChoices-aimed to increase HIV/STI testing among YMSM (age 15-24) who had not recently tested for HIV and were at high risk for HIV acquisition across five US cities. Both apps include the ability to order a HIV self-test with rapid results and a kit for STI self-collection and mailing of samples for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia to a lab for testing. Using assessments of app users (n=80) at pre-randomization and at 3- and 6-months post-randomization and online interview data from a purposive sample of app users (n=37), we report on experiences and lessons learned with HIV self-testing and STI self-collection kits ordered via the apps. Results: Participants were on average 20.7 years of age (SD =2.4), and 49% were non-White or multiple race/ethnicity. Sixty-three percent had a prior HIV test. Over half (58%) had a prior STI test, but only 3% had tested within the past 3 months. Nearly two-thirds ordered an HIV self-testing kit; of whom, 75% reported using at least one self-test kit over the study period. STI self-collection kit ordering rates were also high (54%); however, STI self-collection kit return rates were lower (13%), but with a high positivity rate (5.3%). Both HIV self-testing and STI self-collection kits were highly acceptable, and 87% reported that it was extremely/very helpful to be able to order these kits through the apps. The most common reason for not ordering the HIV/STI kits was preferring to test at a clinic. In interviews, participants expressed feeling empowered by being able to test at home; however, they also raised concerns around STI sample collection. Conclusions: HIV self-testing and STI self-collection kit ordering via mobile apps is feasible, acceptable and may show promise in increasing testing rates among YMSM. The LYNX and MyChoices apps are currently being tested in a full-scale efficacy trial, and if successful, these innovative mobile apps could be scaled up to efficiently increase HIV/STI testing among youth across the US.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an interactive smoking cessation decision‐aid application (pp) compared with a smoking cessation static information app on continuous abstinence. DESIGN: Automated double‐blind randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow‐up (2014‐2015). SETTING: Smartphone‐based. PARTICIPANTS: 684 participants (daily smokers of cigarettes, 18 years old or over) recruited passively from app stores in the USA, Australia, UK and Singapore, and randomised to one of two sub‐apps. INTERVENTIONS: Behavioural, decision‐aid, smartphone application. MAIN OUTCOMES: Continuous abstinence at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. RESULTS: Smokers who received the decision‐aid app were more likely to be continuously abstinent at 1 month compared with the information‐only app (28.5% vs 16.9%; relative risk (RR) 1.68; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.28). The effect was sustained at 3 months (23.8% vs 10.2%; RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.38 to 3.18) and 6 months (10.2% vs 4.8%; RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.81). Participants receiving the decision‐aid app were also more likely to have made an informed choice (31.9% vs 19.6%) and have lower decisional conflict (19.5% vs 3.9%). CONCLUSION: A smartphone decision‐aid app with support features significantly increased smoking cessation and informed choice. With an increasing number of smokers attempting to quit, unassisted evidence‐based decision‐aid apps can provide an effective and user‐friendly option to many who are making quit decisions without healthcare professionals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous mobile health (mHealth) apps have been developed to support smokers attempting to quit smoking. Although these apps have been reported to be successful, only modest improvements in the quit rate have been measured. It has been proposed that efforts to improve user engagement and retention may improve the quit rate further. Owing to the high cost of smoking-related disease, it is considered worthwhile to pursue even small improvements. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test a novel smartphone app that leverages premium currency strategies developed by the mobile games industry in an attempt to improve engagement and retention with a smoking cessation intervention. METHODS: We designed and developed a smoking cessation app called "Quittr" in line with previously developed smoking cessation mHealth apps. In addition to this established framework, we added a stand-alone fully featured city-building clicker-style game called "Tappy Town," and a premium virtual currency called "QuitCoins." The user earns QuitCoins for using the app in a way that contributes positively toward their quit attempt, and they can redeem these coins in Tappy Town for bonuses. To establish whether these features improved engagement and retention, we ran a 5-month randomized controlled trial where the intervention group had the full app with the extra games features, while the control group had the standard app only. Recruitment was performed via web-based advertising. Participants (N=175) had no direct contact with the researchers or other support staff. RESULTS: No significant differences in terms of engagement, retention, or smoking outcomes were found between the control and intervention groups. However, survey data indicated that the majority of the participants valued Tappy Town (10/17, 59%) and the QuitCoins rewards system (13/17, 77%). Usage data also suggested that Tappy Town was widely played and was generally appealing to users (mean total time spent in app, control group: 797 seconds vs intervention group: 3502 seconds, P<.001). Analysis of the results suggests that users in the intervention group may have been negatively affected by the aspects of the chosen design, and some theories were explored to explain this unexpected outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Although the novel features of the Quittr app failed to improve the key outcomes measured in this study, there were enough positive indications to warrant further exploration of the concept. Additional research will be required to identify and correct any design flaws that may have adversely affected our participants before a follow-up study can be completed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause of disease burden and is projected to be the second leading cause of disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States are estimated at US $210.5 billion, with employers bearing over 50% of these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because most adults with depression never receive treatment, there is a need to develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated through new channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression. It was hypothesized that MoodHacker users would experience reduced depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral activation, knowledge of depression, and functioning in the workplace. METHODS: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate depression. Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in partnership with an EAP and with outreach through a variety of additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned within each block to receive, without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or alternative care consisting of links to vetted websites on depression (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment surveys at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral activation, (3) negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization, all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current suicidal ideation and/or severe depression symptoms. RESULTS: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded significant effects on depression symptoms, work productivity, work absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP, but no significant effects on these outcome measures for those without EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an average of 16.0 times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD 1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression symptoms (partial eta(2) = .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when compared to subjects with access to relevant depression Internet sites. The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP (partial eta(2) = .093). For all users, the MoodHacker program also yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating factors of behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week follow-up for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts to maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch, CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be appropriate for implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it seems likely that supporting MoodHacker users with guidance from counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person support.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although fitness technology can track and encourage increases in physical activity, few smartphone apps are based on behavior change theories. Apps that do include behavioral components tend to be costly and often do not include strategies to help those who are unsure of how to increase their physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study is to test the efficacy of a new app, StepMATE, for increasing daily walking in a sample of inactive adults and to examine daily relationships between walking and self-reported mood and energy. METHODS: The participants were middle-aged and older adults aged >=50 years (mean 61.64, SD 7.67 years). They were randomly assigned to receive either a basic, pedometer-like version of the app or a version with supports to help them determine where, when, and with whom to walk. Of the 96 participants randomized to 1 of 2 conditions, 87 (91%) completed pretest assessments and 81 (84%) successfully downloaded the app. Upon downloading the app, step data from the week prior were automatically recorded. The participants in both groups were asked to set a daily walking goal, which they could change at any point during the intervention. They were asked to use the app as much as possible over the next 4 weeks. Twice per day, pop-up notifications assessed mood and energy levels. RESULTS: Although one group had access to additional app features, both groups used the app in a similar way, mainly using just the walk-tracking feature. Multilevel models revealed that both groups took significantly more steps during the 4-week study than during the week before downloading the app (gamma=0.24; P<.001). During the study, the participants in both groups averaged 5248 steps per day compared with an average of 3753 steps per day during the baseline week. Contrary to predictions, there were no differences in step increases between the two conditions. Cognition significantly improved from pre- to posttest (gamma=0.17; P=.02). Across conditions, on days in which the participants took more steps than average, they reported better mood and higher energy levels on the same day and better mood on the subsequent day. Daily associations among walking, mood, and energy were significant for women but not for men and were stronger for older participants (those aged >=62 years) than for the younger participants. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups increased their steps to a similar extent, suggesting that setting and monitoring daily walking goals was sufficient for an initial increase and maintenance of steps. Across conditions, walking had benefits for positive mood and energy levels, particularly for women and older participants. Further investigations should identify other motivating factors that could lead to greater and more sustained increases in physical activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Proper exercise form is critical for the safety and efficacy of therapeutic exercise. This research examines if a novel smartphone application, designed to monitor and provide real‐time corrections during resistance training, can reduce performance errors and elicit a motor learning response. DESIGN: Forty‐two participants aged 18 to 65 years were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. Both groups were tested for the number of movement errors made during a 10‐repetition set completed at baseline, immediately after, and 1 to 2 weeks after a single training session of knee extensions. The treatment group trained with real‐time, smartphone‐generated feedback, whereas the control subjects did not. Group performance (number of errors) was compared across test sets using a 2‐factor mixed‐model analysis of variance. RESULTS: No differences were observed between groups for age, sex, or resistance training experience. There was a significant interaction between test set and group. The treatment group demonstrated fewer errors on posttests 1 and 2 compared with pretest (P < 0.05). There was no reduction in the number of errors on any posttest for control subjects. CONCLUSION: Smartphone apps, such as the one used in this study, may enhance patient supervision, safety, and exercise efficacy across rehabilitation settings. A single training session with the app promoted motor learning and improved exercise performance.

AB  - Up to 81% of women of reproductive age are affected by primary dysmenorrhea. Approximately 15% of patients experience severe menstrual pain, which has a significant impact on their quality of life. Although nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptives are effective treatments, their failure rate is 20% to 25%, in large part, because of adverse effects and/or lack of effectiveness. Additional evidence‐based treatments are needed for management of menstrual pain. Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of self‐acupressure for dysmenorrhea; most of these used it as an add‐on to therapist‐administered acupressure. Self‐acupressure appears to have a beneficial effect, but the evidence is unclear because of risk of bias (mostly from performance and attrition bias). With rapidly increasing availability of smartphone applications (apps) in recent years, use of the apps may support individuals in self‐management strategies. App‐based self‐acupressure could be a novel approach to support women with menstrual pain; however, its effectiveness in a usual care setting is unknown. No randomized controlled trials have evaluated a smartphone app using acupressure or targeting menstrual pain. The aim of this 2‐arm, randomized, pragmatic trial was to investigate whether app‐based self‐acupressure is more effective in reducing pain for women with menstrual pain than usual care. The trial was unblinded. The study was conducted in Berlin, Germany, from December 2012 to April 2015 with enrollment until August 2014. Participants were women aged 18 to 34 years with self‐reported cramping pain of 6 or more on a numeric rating scale (0‐10) for the worst pain intensity during the last menstruation. For 6 consecutive menstruation cycles after randomization, 221 eligible women either performed app‐based self‐acupressure (n = 111) or followed usual care only (n = 110). The primary study outcome measure was themean pain intensity (numeric rating scale) on the days with pain during the third menstruation cycle. Secondary outcome measures assessed at the first, second, third, and sixth menstruation cycles included worst pain intensity during menstruation, duration of pain, 50% responder rates (reduction of mean pain by at least 50%), medication use, sick day leaves, and body efficacy expectation. Data were analyzed according to the intention‐to‐treat principle. Mean patient age was 24.0 (SD, 3.6) years. During the third menstruation, there was a significant difference in favor of the acupressure group (acupressure: 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0‐4.7; usual care: 5.0 [95% CI, 4.6‐5.3]; the mean difference was‐0.6, with a 95% CI of‐1.2 to‐0.1; P = 0.026). By the sixth menstruation cycle, the mean difference between groups increased (‐1.4 [95% CI,‐2.0 to‐0.8]; P < 0.001) and was clinically relevant. Responder rates in the acupressure group at the third and sixth menstruation cycles were 37% and 58%, respectively, and in the usual care group were 23% and 24%. At the third and sixth menstruation cycles, the worst pain intensity (group difference,‐0.6 [95%CI,‐1.2 to‐0.02] and‐1.4 [95%CI,‐2.0 to‐0.7]), the number of days with pain (‐0.4 [95% CI,‐0.9 to‐0.01] and‐1.2 [95% CI,‐1.6 to‐0.7]) and the proportion of women taking pain medication (odds ratio [OR], 0.5 [95% CI, 0.3‐0.9] and 0.3 [95% CI, 0.2‐0.5]) were lower in the acupressure group. Hormonal contraceptive use at the third cycle was more common in the usual care group than in the acupressure group (OR, 0.5 [95% CI, 0.3‐0.97]), but by the sixth cycle was not statistically significantly different (OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3‐1.1]). There was no difference between groups in the number of sick leave days and body efficacy expectation (selfefficacy scale). At the third cycle, using a scale from 0 to 6, the mean satisfaction with the intervention was 3.7 (SD, 1.3); recommending the intervention to others was 4.3 (SD, 1.5); appropriateness of acupressure for menstrual pain was 3.9 (SD, 1.4); and application of acupressure for other pain was 4.3 (SD, 1.5). Self‐acupressure was safe; two‐thirds of the women (67.6%) still applied acupressure after the sixth cycle on all days with pain. These data show that self‐acupressure supported and evaluated by a smartphone app achieved a sustainable reduction in pain and medication compared with usual care. Effects increased over time, and adherence rates were high. However, the results may be associated with a high risk of bias because of the lack of blinding. Future trials are needed to provide long‐term data and compare acupressure with other active treatments options.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of diabetes self‐management education and support via a smartphone app in individuals with type 2 diabetes on insulin therapy. Research design and methods: Open two‐arm multicenter parallel randomized controlled superiority trial. The intervention group (n=115) received theory and evidence‐based self‐management education and support via a smartphone app (optionally two or six times per week, once daily at different times). The control group (n=115) received care as usual. Primary outcome: HbA1c at 6 months. Other outcomes included HbA1c â‰¤53 mmol/mol (â‰¤7%) without any hypoglycemic event, body mass index, glycemic variability, dietary habits and quality of life. We performed multiple imputation and regression models adjusted for baseline value, age, sex, diabetes duration and insulin dose. Results: Sixty‐six general practices and five hospital outpatient clinics recruited 230 participants. Baseline HbA1c was comparable between groups (8.1% and 8.3%, respectively). At 6 months, the HbA1c was 63.8 mmol/mol (8.0%) in the intervention vs 66.2 mmol/mol (8.2%) in the control group; adjusted difference ‐0.93 mmol/mol (‐0.08%), 95% CI ‐4.02 to 2.17 mmol/mol (‐0.37% to 0.20%), p=0.557. The odds for achieving an HbA1c level â‰¤7% without any hypoglycemic event was lower in the intervention group: OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.35. There was no effect on secondary outcomes. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This smartphone app providing diabetes self‐management education and support had small and clinically not relevant effects. Apps should be more personalized and target individuals who think the app will be useful for them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) suffer from exacerbations, a worsening of their respiratory symptoms that warrants medical treatment. Exacerbations are often poorly recognized or managed by patients, leading to increased disease burden and health care costs. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effects of a smart mobile health (mHealth) tool that supports COPD patients in the self‐management of exacerbations by providing predictions of early exacerbation onset and timely treatment advice without the interference of health care professionals. METHODS: In a multicenter, 2‐arm randomized controlled trial with 12‐months follow‐up, patients with COPD used the smart mHealth tool (intervention group) or a paper action plan (control group) when they experienced worsening of respiratory symptoms. For our primary outcome exacerbation‐free time, expressed as weeks without exacerbation, we used an automated telephone questionnaire system to measure weekly respiratory symptoms and treatment actions. Secondary outcomes were health status, self‐efficacy, self‐management behavior, health care utilization, and usability. For our analyses, we used negative binomial regression, multilevel logistic regression, and generalized estimating equation regression models. RESULTS: Of the 87 patients with COPD recruited from primary and secondary care centers, 43 were randomized to the intervention group. We found no statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group in exacerbation‐free weeks (mean 30.6, SD 13.3 vs mean 28.0, SD 14.8 weeks, respectively; rate ratio 1.21; 95% CI 0.77‐1.91) or in health status, self‐efficacy, self‐management behavior, and health care utilization. Patients using the mHealth tool valued it as a more supportive tool than patients using the paper action plan. Patients considered the usability of the mHealth tool as good. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show beneficial effects of a smart mHealth tool on exacerbation‐free time, health status, self‐efficacy, self‐management behavior, and health care utilization in patients with COPD compared with the use of a paper action plan. Participants were positive about the supportive function and the usability of the mHealth tool. mHealth may be a valuable alternative for COPD patients who prefer a digital tool instead of a paper action plan.

AB  - Background
Increasing access to treatment via smartphone apps is an important topic in Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD). ‘Challenger’ is an app promoting exposure exercises in daily life. The present study evaluated the additional benefit of using the app as adjunct to Internet-based unguided self-help for SAD. In a second step, we also tested how the app and the self-help programme (SH) should best be combined.

Method
209 patients diagnosed with SAD were randomly allocated to three groups. Group 1 received the app and the self-help programme for six weeks (parallel treatment), group 2 first received SH for six weeks and then the app for six weeks (sequential treatment). Group 3 was a wait-list group. Comparisons were made at week 7 evaluating the potential add-on effect of the app (SH plus app versus SH only) and at week 14 comparing the parallel to the sequential treatment. Participants filled in questionnaires prior, during, and post treatment, and at 4- and 12- months follow-up.

Results
Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant effect of adding the app to Internet-based self-help. However, among participants actively using the app, adding Challenger to self-help resulted in significantly less social anxiety (d = 0.30). At week 14, decreases in social anxiety were large for both the parallel and the sequential group with no differences between the active groups (dwithin = 1.12–1.19). Changes were maintained throughout the follow-up period.

Conclusion
Results of the current study cautiously support the notion of adding a smartphone app to unguided self-help for SAD. Future studies should investigate how patients can be motivated to use the app more frequently.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess 16‐wk improvements of physical fitness, metabolic, and psychological parameters in people living with HIV (PLWH) exercising with the support of a smartphone application, as compared with a control group exercising without application. METHODS: This was a randomized, open‐label, pilot study enrolling PLWH in a 16‐wk protocol consisting of moderate physical activity three times per week, which included an initial coach‐supervised period of 4 wk, followed by 12 wk where participants trained independently. Participants were allocated to either an experimental group that trained using a smartphone application (APP) or a control group that practiced following a hard copy training program (No‐APP). At baseline (BL) and after 16 wk (W16), patients were assessed for cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, blood lipid profile, and POMS. RESULTS: Forty‐eight PLWH were screened and 38 were eligible: 20 were allocated to the APP group and 18 to the No‐APP group. Two APP and two No‐APP participants were lost to follow‐up. Intention‐to‐treat analysis showed a W16 improvement from BL of ≥15% V˙ O2peak in 13 (72%) of 18 in APP, but only in 3 (19%) of 16 in No‐APP participants (P = 0.025). Significant W16 improvements were observed in APP, but not in No‐APP participants, in V˙O2peak; fat mass and fat‐free mass percent; total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides; vigor; and total mood by POMS. Accordingly, significant percent change differences between the APP and the No‐APP groups were observed in V˙O2peak; fat and fat‐free mass percent; total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides; and depression, vigor, anger, and total mood by POMS. CONCLUSIONS: Exercising using a smartphone application improved cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, cholesterol profiles, and psychological outcomes in PLWH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease that is considered a global public health problem. Education and self-monitoring by diabetic patients help to optimize and make possible a satisfactory metabolic control enabling improved management and reduced morbidity and mortality. The global growth in the use of mobile phones makes them a powerful platform to help provide tailored health, delivered conveniently to patients through health apps. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of mobile apps through a systematic review and meta-analysis to assist DM patients in treatment. METHODS: We conducted searches in the electronic databases MEDLINE (Pubmed), Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), including manual search in references of publications that included systematic reviews, specialized journals, and gray literature. We considered eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted after 2008 with participants of all ages, patients with DM, and users of apps to help manage the disease. The meta-analysis of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was performed in Review Manager software version 5.3. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1236 publications. Of these, 13 studies were included that evaluated 1263 patients. In 6 RCTs, there were a statistical significant reduction (P<.05) of HbA1c at the end of studies in the intervention group. The HbA1c data were evaluated by meta-analysis with the following results (mean difference, MD -0.44; CI: -0.59 to -0.29; P<.001; I²=32%).The evaluation favored the treatment in patients who used apps without significant heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: The use of apps by diabetic patients could help improve the control of HbA1c. In addition, the apps seem to strengthen the perception of self-care by contributing better information and health education to patients. Patients also become more self-confident to deal with their diabetes, mainly by reducing their fear of not knowing how to deal with potential hypoglycemic episodes that may occur.

AB  - Background: In‐person cognitive‐behavioral stress‐management interventions are consistently associated with reduced cancer distress. However, face‐to‐face delivery is an access barrier for many patients, and there is a need to develop remote‐delivered interventions. The current study evaluated the preliminary efficacy of an application (app)‐based cancer stress‐management intervention, StressProffen, in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Cancer survivors, maximum 1‐year posttreatment (NÂ =Â 172), were randomized to StressProffen (nÂ =Â 84) or a usual care control group (nÂ =Â 88). Participants received a blended delivery care model: (a) one face‐to‐face introduction session, (b) 10 app‐based cognitive‐behavioral stress‐management modules, and (c) follow‐up phone calls at weeks 2‐3 and 6‐7. Outcome measures included stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale), and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL; Short‐Form Health Surveys [SF‐36]) at 3‐months post‐intervention, analyzed with change scores as dependent variables in linear regression models. Results: Participants were primarily women (82%), aged 20‐78Â years (mean 52, SD 11.2), with mixed cancer types (majority breast cancer; 48%). Analysis of 149 participants completing questionnaires at baseline and 3Â months revealed significant intervention effects: decreased stress (mean difference [MD] âˆ’2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], [âˆ’5.2 to âˆ’0.4]; PÂ =.022) and improved HRQoL (Role Physical MDÂ =Â 17.7, [CI 3.7‐31.3], PÂ =.013; Social Functioning MDÂ =Â 8.5, [CI 0.7‐16.2], PÂ =.034; Role Emotional MDÂ =Â 19.5, [CI 3.7‐35.2], PÂ =.016; Mental Health MDÂ =Â 6.7, [CI 1.7‐11.6], PÂ =.009). No significant changes were observed for anxiety or depression. Conclusions: Digital‐based cancer stress‐management interventions, such as StressProffen, have the potential to provide easily accessible, effective psychosocial support for cancer survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive-behavioral stress management interventions are associated with improved psychological well-being for cancer survivors. The availability of, access to, and outreach of these in-person interventions are limited, however. The current study, therefore, evaluated the efficacy of StressProffen, a digital application (app)-based stress management intervention for cancer survivors, in a 12-month randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Cancer survivors 1 year or less after their treatment (N = 172) were randomized to the StressProffen intervention (n = 84) or a usual-care control group (n = 88). The intervention was delivered in a simple blended care model: 1) 1 in-person introduction session, 2) 10 app-based cognitive-behavioral stress management modules, and 3) 2 follow-up phone calls. Stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), self-regulatory fatigue (Self-Regulatory Fatigue 18), and health-related quality of life (HRQOL; RAND-36) were examined at the baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Generalized linear models for repeated measures were fitted to compare effects over time. RESULTS: Participants were mainly female (82%), had a mean age of 52 years (standard deviation, 11.3 years; range, 20-78 years), and had a variety of cancer types (mostly breast cancer [48%]). Over the 12-month study time, the intervention group reported significantly decreased stress (P < .001), depression (P = .003), and self-regulatory fatigue (P = .002) as well as improved HRQOL (for 6 of 8 domains, P <= .015) in comparison with controls. The largest favored effects for the intervention group were observed at 6 months: stress (estimated mean difference [MD], -5.1; P < .001), anxiety (MD, -1.4; P = .015), depression (MD, -2.1; P < .001), self-regulatory fatigue (MD, -4.9; P < .001), and HRQOL (7 of 8 domains; P <= .037). CONCLUSIONS: Digital stress management interventions such as StressProffen have the potential to extend the outreach of psychological interventions and provide easily available and effective psychosocial support for cancer survivors.

AB  - The purpose of this randomized control study was to examine the effects of the use of a mindfulness smartphone app on student self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, and serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The sample included college students enrolled in courses at a university in South Florida. Forty-four students were randomly allocated to either the mindfulness app group (n = 22) or the control group (n = 22).Participants in the mindfulness app group were instructed to complete a guided meditation on the app for 10 minutes per day for 5 weeks. Participants in the control group were offered the intervention after the 5-week protocol ended. A pretest-posttest design was used to investigate the effects of the mindfulness app intervention on self reported levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, in addition to serum level BDNF.Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), and BDNF was measured by blood draw of the biomarker. ANOVA analyses were conducted to determine statistical significance on the variables between the intervention and control groups. No significant differences were found in DASS scores and BDNF levels between groups at posttest.Although small to medium effect sizes were reported for all variables, the small sample size may have limited the potential to determine statistical significance between the groups. Noncompliance with the daily mindfulness app use may have further contributed to the results. Nevertheless, this research contributes to the literature on mindfulness by the exploration into mindfulness meditation, mindfulness apps, and the mind-body paradigm. Replication of the study with larger student samples, in other universities, and with controls for possible confounding variables was recommended.

AB  - We investigated whether a mindfulness meditation program delivered via a smartphone application could improve psychological well‐being, reduce job strain, and reduce ambulatory blood pressure during the workday. Participants were 238 healthy employees from two large United Kingdom companies that were randomized to a mindfulness meditation practice app or a wait‐list control condition. The app offered 45 prerecorded 10‐ to 20‐min guided audio meditations. Participants were asked to complete one meditation per day. Psychosocial measures and blood pressure throughout one working day were measured at baseline and eight weeks later; a follow‐up survey was also emailed to participants 16 weeks after the intervention start. Usage data showed that during the 8‐week intervention period, participants randomized to the intervention completed an average of 17 meditation sessions (range 0‐45 sessions). The intervention group reported significant improvement in well‐being, distress, job strain, and perceptions of workplace social support compared to the control group. In addition, the intervention group had a marginally significant decrease in self‐measured workday systolic blood pressure from pre‐ to post‐intervention. Sustained positive effects in the intervention group were found for well‐being and job strain at the 16‐week follow‐up assessment. This trial suggests that short guided mindfulness meditations delivered via smartphone and practiced multiple times per week can improve outcomes related to work stress and well‐being, with potentially lasting effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A lifesaving treatment for myocardial infarction is the placement of a stent in a closed or obstructed coronary artery. The largest modifiable risk factor after receiving a stent is medication adherence to Dual AntiPlatelet Therapy, a combination of P2Y12 inhibitors and aspirin. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the acceptability of a protocol and an intervention using the My Interventional Drug‐Eluting Stent Educational App (MyIDEA) and to evaluate medication adherence using the proportion of days covered (PDC) and platelet activation tests in a multisite randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Potential participants who received a post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure with a drug‐eluting stent were approached. All patients older than 50 years and who spoke English were recruited. Participants were recruited, baseline demographics were collected, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine‐Short Form, Burden‐Benefit questionnaire, 36‐Item Short Form Health Survey, and PCI knowledge questionnaire were administered. Block randomization was used to randomize participants to either usual care or MyIDEA supplementation. MyIDEA is a personalized educational intervention based on the Kolb experiential learning theory using patient narratives for education. During the visits, participants' blood was collected to measure platelet suppression from medication. During the second and third encounters, the Morisky medication adherence score and cardiology outcomes were measured. The study was conducted at the University of Illinois Hospital and John H Stroger Jr Cook County Hospital with appropriate ethical approvals. Platelet suppression was measured through aspirin reactive units and P2Y12 reactive units. Medication adherence was measured using the PDC. The analysis team was blinded to the participants' group membership. The primary outcome was a feasibility analysis of recruitment and retention. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 60.4 years (SD 7.1); the majority of patients were black and non‐Hispanic. The majority of patients' reading levels were seventh grade or above, and they were not very familiar with other electronic devices for information and communication. The number of control subjects was 21, and the number of participants in the interventional arm was 24. The interventional group was able to use MyIDEA in both the hospital and outpatient setting. However, there was no significant difference in platelet suppression or medication adherence between groups. There were also differences between the groups in terms of depression and anxiety, initially, as measured by HADS. No documented adverse event associated with the intervention was found. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients are willing to use tablet devices to be educated about health conditions. Additional studies are required to measure the effectiveness and determine the most suitable timing and location for patient education.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self‐management of hypertension is of great significance given its increasing incidence and its associated disabilities. In view of the increased use of mobile health in medicine, the present study evaluated the effect of a self‐management application on patient adherence to hypertension treatment. METHODS: This clinical trial was performed on 120 hypertensive patients who were provided with a mobile intervention for 8 weeks and followed up until the 24th week. Data on the primary outcome (adherence to treatment) and secondary outcomes (adherence to the DASH diet, regular monitoring of blood pressure, and physical activity) were collected using a questionnaire and a mobile application, respectively. The inter‐group change difference over time was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (general linear model). RESULTS: The treatment adherence score increased by an average of 5.9 (95% CI 5.0‐6.7) in the intervention group compared to the control group. The scores of "adherence to the low‐fat and low‐salt diet plans" were 1.7 (95% CI 1.3‐2.1) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.2‐1.9), respectively. Moreover, moderate physical activity increased to 100.0 min (95% CI 61.7‐138.3) per week in the intervention group. CONCLUSION: The treatment and control of blood pressure require a multifaceted approach given its complexity and multifactorial nature. Considering the widespread use of smartphones, mHealth interventions can be effective in self‐management and better patient adherence to treatments. Our results showed that this application can be used as a successful tool for hypertension self‐management in patients attending public hospitals in developing countries.

AB  - Pokemon Go is a smartphone game that has the potential to improve depressive symptoms, physical activity, and social connectedness amongst users. This game has gained considerable attention in the media as it encourages physical activity and social interaction and thus may have health benefits for users, but research into this possibility is at an early stage. For instance, this game's potential to decrease depressive symptoms by way of increasing physical activity and social connectedness are still unexplored. This study investigated the effects of playing Pokemon Go on individuals' depressive symptoms, social connectedness, and physical activity as compared to a control condition that played Candy Crush, a game that does not encourage physical activity and social connectedness, for four weeks.Participants recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) who reported at least mild levels of depressive symptoms, were randomly assigned to either the Pokemon Go (n = 80) or the Candy Crush (n = 90) conditions. Participants in each group first completed screening questions about technology use and were required to meet criteria for at least mild depression to be eligible for participation in this study. Individuals who screened into the study were also required to complete a measure of social connectedness and physical activity. Participants were asked to engage with their respective apps three times a week for 30 minutes for four weeks. Participants were then asked to complete a 4-week follow-up assessment that contained the same instruments delivered at baseline.Participants in both groups experienced a moderate decrease in depressive symptoms and an increase in social connectedness, but no change in physical activity. Differences between the two groups were not found to be statistically significant across the three outcome variables. Based on these findings it does not appear that Pokemon Go was more effective at treating depressive symptoms, increasing physical activity, or increasing social connectedness when compared to a traditional smartphone game.

AB  - Background: There is a dual need for (1) innovative theory‐based smartphone applications for smoking cessation and (2) controlled trials to evaluate their efficacy. Accordingly, this study tested the feasibility, acceptability, preliminary efficacy, and mechanism of behavioral change of an innovative smartphone‐delivered acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) application for smoking cessation vs. an application following US Clinical Practice Guidelines. Method: Adult participants were recruited nationally into the double‐blind randomized controlled pilot trial (n= 196) that compared smartphone‐delivered ACT for smoking cessation application (SmartQuit) with the National Cancer Institute's application for smoking cessation (QuitGuide). Results: We recruited 196 participants in two months. SmartQuit participants opened their application an average of 37.2 times, as compared to 15.2 times for QuitGuide participants (p< 0001). The overall quit rates were 13% in SmartQuit vs. 8% in QuitGuide (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 0.8‐10.3). Consistent with ACT's theory of change, among those scoring low (below the median) on acceptance of cravings at baseline (n= 88), the quit rates were 15% in SmartQuit vs. 8% in QuitGuide (OR = 2.9; 95% CI = 0.6‐20.7). Conclusions: ACT is feasible to deliver by smartphone application and shows higher engagement and promising quit rates compared to an application that follows US Clinical Practice Guidelines. As results were limited by the pilot design (e.g., small sample), a full‐scale efficacy trial is now needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent smoking after a cancer diagnosis predicts worse treatment outcomes and mortality, but access to effective smoking cessation interventions is limited. Smartphone apps can address this problem by providing a highly accessible, low-cost smoking cessation intervention designed for patients with a recent cancer diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to summarize our development process and report the trial design, feasibility, participant acceptability, preliminary effectiveness, and impact on processes of change (eg, cancer stigma) of the first-known smoking cessation smartphone app targeted for cancer patients. METHODS: We used an agile, user-centered design framework to develop a fully automated smartphone app called Quit2Heal that provided skills training and stories from cancer survivors focusing on coping with internalized shame, cancer stigma, depression, and anxiety as core triggers of smoking. Quit2Heal was compared with the National Cancer Institute's QuitGuide, a widely used stop smoking app for the general population, in a pilot double-blinded randomized trial with a 2-month follow-up period. Participants were 59 adult smokers diagnosed with cancer within the past 12 months and recruited through 2 cancer center care networks and social media over a 12-month period. The most common types of cancer diagnosed were lung (21/59, 36%) and breast (10/59, 17%) cancers. The 2-month follow-up survey retention rate was 92% (54/59) and did not differ by study arm (P=.15). RESULTS: Compared with QuitGuide participants, Quit2Heal participants were more satisfied with their assigned app (90% [19/21] for Quit2Heal vs 65% [17/26] for QuitGuide; P=.047) and were more likely to report that the app assigned to them was made for someone like them (86% [18/21] for Quit2Heal vs 62% [16/26] for QuitGuide; P=.04). Quit2Heal participants opened their app a greater number of times during the 2-month trial period, although this difference was not statistically significant (mean 10.0, SD 14.40 for Quit2Heal vs mean 6.1, SD 5.3 for QuitGuide; P=.33). Self-reported 30-day point prevalence quit rates at the 2-month follow-up were 20% (5/25) for Quit2Heal versus 7% (2/29) for QuitGuide (odds ratio 5.16, 95% CI 0.71-37.29; P=.10). Quit2Heal participants also showed greater improvement in internalized shame, cancer stigma, depression, and anxiety, although these were not statistically significant (all P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot randomized trial with a high short-term retention rate, Quit2Heal showed promising acceptability and effectiveness for helping cancer patients stop smoking. Testing in a full-scale randomized controlled trial with a longer follow-up period and a larger sample size is required to test the effectiveness, mediators, and moderators of this promising digital cessation intervention.

AB  - Importance: Smoking is a leading cause of premature death globally. Smartphone applications for smoking cessation are ubiquitous and address barriers to accessing traditional treatments, yet there is limited evidence for their efficacy. Objective: To determine the efficacy of a smartphone application for smoking cessation based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) vs a National Cancer Institute smoking cessation application based on US clinical practice guidelines (USCPG). Design, Setting, and Participants: A 2‐group, stratified, double‐blind, individually randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 27, 2017, to September 28, 2018, among 2415 adult cigarette smokers (n = 1214 for the ACT‐based smoking cessation application group and n = 1201 for the USCPG‐based smoking cessation application group) with 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month postrandomization follow‐up. The study was prespecified in the trial protocol. Follow‐up data collection started on August 26, 2017, and ended at the last randomized participant's 12‐month follow‐up survey on December 23, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 25 to April 3, 2020. The primary analysis was performed on a complete‐case basis, with intent‐to‐treat missing as smoking and multiple imputation sensitivity analyses. Interventions: iCanQuit, an ACT‐based smoking cessation application, which taught acceptance of smoking triggers, and the National Cancer Institute QuitGuide, a USCPG‐based smoking cessation application, which taught avoidance of smoking triggers. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was self‐reported 30‐day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 12 months after randomization. Secondary outcomes were 7‐day PPA at 12 months after randomization, prolonged abstinence, 30‐day and 7‐day PPA at 3 and 6 months after randomization, missing data imputed with multiple imputation or coded as smoking, and cessation of all tobacco products (including e‐cigarettes) at 12 months after randomization. Results: Participants were 2415 adult cigarette smokers (1700 women [70.4%]; 1666 White individuals [69.0%] and 868 racial/ethnic minorities [35.9%]; mean [SD] age at enrollment, 38.2 [10.9] years) from all 50 US states. The 3‐month follow‐up data retention rate was 86.7% (2093), the 6‐month retention rate was 88.4% (2136), and the 12‐month retention rate was 87.2% (2107). For the primary outcome of 30‐day PPA at the 12‐month follow‐up, iCanQuit participants had 1.49 times higher odds of quitting smoking compared with QuitGuide participants (28.2% [293 of 1040] vs 21.1% [225 of 1067]; odds ratio [OR], 1.49; 95% CI, 1.22‐1.83; P < .001). Effect sizes were very similar and statistically significant for 7‐day PPA at the 12‐month follow‐up (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.12‐1.63; P = .002), prolonged abstinence at the 12‐month follow‐up (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.45‐2.76; P < .001), abstinence from all tobacco products (including e‐cigarettes) at the 12‐month follow‐up (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.28‐1.99; P < .001), 30‐day PPA at 3‐month follow‐up (OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.68‐2.89; P < .001), 30‐day PPA at 6‐month follow‐up (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.63‐2.54; P < .001), 7‐day PPA at 3‐month follow‐up (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.64‐2.54; P < .001), and 7‐day PPA at 6‐month follow‐up (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.42‐2.10; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This trial provides evidence that, compared with a USCPG‐based smartphone application, an ACT‐based smartphone application was more efficacious for quitting cigarette smoking and thus can be an impactful treatment option.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Engagement with digital interventions is a well-known predictor of treatment outcomes, but this knowledge has had limited actionable value. Instead, learning why engagement with digital interventions impact treatment outcomes can lead to targeted improvements in their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test a serial mediation model of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) smartphone intervention for smoking cessation. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, participants (N=2415) from 50 US states were assigned to the ACT-based smartphone intervention (iCanQuit) or comparison smartphone intervention (QuitGuide). Their engagement with the apps (primary measure: number of logins) was measured during the first 3 months, ACT processes were measured at baseline and 3 months (acceptance of internal cues to smoke, valued living), and smoking cessation was measured at 12 months with 87% follow-up retention. RESULTS: There was a significant serial mediation effect of iCanQuit on smoking cessation through multiple indicators of intervention engagement (ie, total number of logins, total number of minutes used, and total number of unique days of use) and in turn through increases in mean acceptance of internal cues to smoke from baseline to 3 months. Analyses of the acceptance subscales showed that the mediation was through acceptance of physical sensations and emotions, but not acceptance of thoughts. There was no evidence that the effect of the iCanQuit intervention was mediated through changes in valued living. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study of serial mediators underlying the efficacy of smartphone apps for smoking cessation, our results suggest the effect of the iCanQuit ACT-based smartphone app on smoking cessation was mediated through multiple indicators of engagement and in turn through increases in the acceptance of physical sensations and emotions that cue smoking.

AB  - We developed and tested a mobile phone application (app) to support individuals embarking on a partial meal replacement programme (MRP). Overweight or obese women were randomly allocated to one of two study groups. The intervention group received an MRP Support app. The control group received a static app based on the information available with the MRP. A total of 58 adult women (Support n = 28; Control n = 30) participated in the 8‐week trial. Their BMI was 26‐43 kg/m2 Usage data suggested that the intervention group were more engaged with using the app throughout the study period. Mixed modelling revealed that the difference in weight loss between the intervention and control groups (estimated mean, EM = 3.2% and 2.2% respectively) was not significant (P = 0.08). Objective data suggested that users of the Support app were more engaged than those using the control app. A total of 1098 prompts (54%) asking people in the intervention group to enter their meals were completed prior to the evening prompt. Women in the intervention group reported a greater increase in positive affect (i.e. mood) than those in the control group (EM = 0.48 and ‐0.01, respectively) (P = 0.012). At Week 8, those in the control group reported a greater decrease in the effort they were willing to put into staying on the diet than those who received the Support app (EM = ‐2.8 and ‐1.4, respectively) (P = 0.024). The Support app could be a useful adjunct to existing MRPs for psychological outcomes.

AB  - Our aim was to design and evaluate a weight‐loss program, including a partial meal replacement program, point‐of‐care testing and face‐to‐face and smartphone app support, appropriate for delivery in a community pharmacy setting. Overweight or obese adults (n = 146, 71.2% female, 48.18 ± 11.75 years old) were recruited to participate in a 24‐week weight loss study and randomised to two app conditions. The dietary intervention was consistent regardless of app. Twelve weeks of clinic appointments with a trained consultant were followed by only app support for an additional 12 weeks. By week 24, retention was 57.5%. There were no differences between app conditions. Based on a cohort analysis of the trial, the mean decrease in weight from baseline to week 24 was 6.43 ± 1.06 kg for males (p < 0.001) and 5.66 ± 0.70 kg for females (p < 0.001). Mixed models also revealed decreases for LDL Cholesterol (‐0.13 ± 0.08 mmol/L, nonsignificant), triglycerides (‐0.08 ± 0.05 mmol/L, nonsignificant) and an increase in HDL cholesterol (+0.08 ± 0.04 mmol/L, ns) were not significant by week 24. Blood glucose (‐0.23 ± 0.08 mmol/L, p = 0.040) and blood pressure (Systolic blood pressure ‐5.77 ± 1.21 Hg/mm, p < 0.001) were significantly lower at week 24 compared to baseline. Weight loss self‐efficacy increased and remained significantly higher than baseline at week 24 (16.85 ± 2.93, p < 0.001). Overall, the program supported participants and was successful in achieving significant weight loss and improvements in health outcomes over 24 weeks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few people successfully maintain lost weight over the longer term. Mobile phones have the potential to deliver weight loss management programs that can encourage self‐monitoring while also providing some behavioral therapy to assist users in developing personal skills that may be necessary for improved longer term weight loss maintenance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a program supporting weight maintenance, which uses a behaviorally based mobile phone app to manage weight, food, exercise, mood, and stress. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial over 24 weeks, the full version of the app (MotiMate) was compared with a control app (monitoring only; excluding mood and stress) for its effect on weight, diet, and psychological well‐being. Both apps had the same visual appearance and were designed to deliver all intervention content without face‐to‐face contact. The control version included features to track weight, food intake, and exercise with limited feedback and no encouraging/persuasive features. The intervention app included more persuasive and interactive features to help users track their weight, food intake, and physical activity and prompted users to enter data each day through notifications and included a mood and stress workshopping tool. Participants were recruited through advertising and existing databases. Clinic visits occurred at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. At all visits, the clinical trial manager recorded body weight, and participants then completed a computer‐delivered survey, which measured psychological and lifestyle outcomes. Objective app usage data were recorded throughout the trial. RESULTS: A total of 88 adults who had lost and maintained at least 5% of their body weight within the last 2 years were randomized (45 MotiMate and 43 control). Overall, 75% (66/88) were female, and 69% (61/88) completed week 24 with no differences in dropout by condition (Ï‡21,87=0.7, P=.49). Mixed models suggested no significant changes in weight or psychological outcomes over 24 weeks regardless of condition. Of 61 completers, 53% (32/61) remained within 2% of their starting weight. Significant increases occurred over 24 weeks for satisfaction with life and weight loss self‐efficacy regardless of app condition. Diet and physical activity behaviors did not vary by app or week. Negative binomial models indicated that those receiving the full app remained active users of the app for 46 days longer than controls (P=.02). Users of the full version of the app also reported that they felt more supported than those with the control app (P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although some aspects of the intervention app such as usage and user feedback showed promise, there were few observable effects on behavioral and psychological outcomes. Future evaluation of the app should implement alternative research methods or target more specific populations to better understand the utility of the coping interface.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of change of digital therapeutics is a critical step to improve digital health outcomes and optimize their development. Access to and engagement with digital content is arguably a core mechanism of change of these interventions. However, the mediational role of app engagement has been largely unexamined. To evaluate the mediational effect of engaging with a digital therapeutic for smoking cessation designed for adults with psychiatric disorders. Secondary analysis of a pilot clinical trial of 62 adults with serious mental illness who were randomized to receive either a tailored digital therapeutic (Learn to Quit) or a digital therapeutic for the general public (NCI QuitGuide). Engagement was captured using background analytics of app utilization, including (a) number of interactions with app content, (b) minutes/day of app use, and (c) number of days used. The main outcome was reductions in cigarettes per day from baseline to the four‐month endpoint. Mediational analysis followed the Preacher and Hayes bootstrap method. Number of application interactions fully mediated reductions in cigarettes per day in the Learn to Quit application but not in QuitGuide (Average Causal Mediation Effect = .31, p = .02). Minutes/day of app use played an uncertain role, and number of days used was not a significant mediator. Results suggest that one of the mechanisms of action of the Learn to Quit device, engagement with theory‐based content, functioned as intended. Future research of digital therapeutics should emphasize granular approaches to evaluating apps' mechanisms of action.

AB  - Background: Loneliness is a widespread and significant problem on college campuses. Prolonged loneliness in young adulthood is a risk factor for concurrent and future mental health problems and attrition, making college a critical time for support. Cognitive and behavioral interventions show promise for decreasing loneliness and can be widely disseminated through technology. Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the initial efficacy, feasibility, and desirability of a smartphone app, Nod, designed to deliver cognitive and behavioral skill‐building exercises to reduce loneliness during the transition to college. Methods: First‐year college students (N=221, mean age 18.7 years, 59% female) were recruited online during incoming student orientation, and randomized to either receive immediate access to Nod (experimental group, n=100) or access after 4 weeks (control group, n=121). The app delivered skills via fully automated (1) “social challenges,” suggested activities designed to build social connections; (2) reflections, brief cognitive reframing exercises; and (3) student testimonials that encouraged a growth mindset toward social connection building. Main intention‐to‐treat analyses were used to compare the conditions on self‐assessed loneliness, depressive symptoms, and other mental health and college adjustment outcomes at week 4, controlling for baseline values on those variables. Analyses were also performed to test the hypothesis that the treatment benefits would be particularly pronounced for participants with heightened psychological vulnerability at baseline (ie, higher baseline depressive symptoms and loneliness). Results: Retention was 97% at week 4, and participants viewed an average 36.7 pages of app content. There were no significant condition differences in loneliness at week 4 (F1, 211=0.05, P=.82; ηp2 <.001). However, there was a significant condition‐by‐baseline depression interaction to predict week‐4 loneliness (F1,209=9.65, P=.002; ηp2 =.04). Simple slope analyses indicated that baseline depression positively predicted week‐4 loneliness among control participants (r=0.30, t209=3.81, P<.001), but not among experimental participants (r=‐0.09, t209=‐0.84, P=.40), suggesting that Nod buffered participants with high baseline depression scores from experiencing heightened midquarter loneliness. Similarly, there were no significant condition differences in other week‐4 outcomes. However, moderation by baseline vulnerability was found for week‐4 depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and indices of college adjustment (eg, perceived social support and campus belonging). Conclusions: Although Nod exposure did not impact outcomes for the full sample, these results provide initial evidence of its benefit for vulnerable students. The results of this trial suggest that cognitive and behavioral skills delivered via a mobile app can buffer psychologically vulnerable college students against heightened loneliness and depressive symptoms, as well as other negative college adjustment outcomes. Future work will aim to improve upon app engagement, and to address loneliness among other key populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are one of the most common and ever‐increasing mental health problems among students worldwide. Conventional treatment options, particularly psychotherapy, do not reach all students in need of help. Internet‐ and mobile‐based interventions are promising alternatives for narrowing the treatment gap. OBJECTIVE: In the framework of a randomized controlled trial, we aim to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and side effects of a self‐help smartphone app (MCT & More) based on cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment therapy, and metacognitive training in a sample of students with self‐reported depressive symptoms. Furthermore, we were interested in examining the influence of treatment expectations and attitudes toward internet‐ and mobile‐based interventions on treatment adherence and effectiveness. METHODS: A total of 400 students were recruited via open access websites and randomized to either the intervention group (n=200), who received access to the self‐help smartphone app MCT & More for a period of 4 weeks, or to a wait‐list control group (n=200). The Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (depression) served as the primary outcome parameter, and the Rosenberg Self‐esteem Scale (self‐esteem) and the global item of the World Health Organization Quality of Life‐abbreviated version (quality of life) served as the secondary outcome parameters. The Attitudes Towards Psychological Online Interventions was used to measure attitudes toward internet‐ and mobile‐based interventions. Outcome expectations were assessed using the Patient Questionnaire on Therapy Expectation and Evaluation, and side effects were assessed using the Inventory for Assessing Negative Effects of Psychotherapy. RESULTS: Per‐protocol (PP), complete‐case, and intention‐to‐treat analyses showed a significantly higher reduction in depressive symptoms (PP: F1222=3.98; P=.047; d=0.26) and a significantly higher increase in self‐esteem (PP: F1220=8.79; P=.003; d=0.77) in the intervention group than in the wait‐list control group. Most participants regularly used the self‐help smartphone app (91/120, 75.8%, at least once a week). The more positive the attitude toward internet‐ and mobile‐based interventions (r=0.260; P=.004) and the more positive the outcome expectation (r=0.236; P=.009), the more frequently the self‐help smartphone app was used. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of the self‐help smartphone app MCT & More was demonstrated among students with depressive symptoms compared with a wait‐list control group. The app could be offered regularly as a low‐threshold intervention to enhance students' health. TRIAL REGISTRATION: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00020941; https://tinyurl.com/pr84w6er.

AB  - Background: There is a known positive relationship between time in therapy and therapy outcomes. Effective rehabilitation should therefore include larger doses of therapy. However, individuals participating in inpatient rehabilitation have low levels of activity throughout the day. This level of inactivity may limit rehabilitation potential. New technologies which deliver personalised exercise programs and track time spent on exercises may lead to greater activity levels and therefore improve functional outcomes in rehabilitation. This pilot randomised control trial aimed to investigate whether an app‐based supplemental exercise program in orthopaedic rehabilitation will be feasible and acceptable to participants, increase activity levels and improve functional outcomes. Methods: Participants were randomised to receive supplemental exercise via an app (PTPalâ„¢) on a tablet device additional to usual care or usual care alone. Primary outcome measures were participant satisfaction with app‐based supplemental exercise, total repetitions of each activity and time in supplemental exercise programs. Secondary measures were 10‐m walk test (10MWT), 6‐min walk test (6MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG), Functional Independence Measure and length of stay assessed by a blinded assessor. Results: Twenty individuals admitted into an inpatient private general rehabilitation unit for orthopaedic rehabilitation over a 4‐week duration were included in this study. High acceptance of the app‐based supplemental exercise program was demonstrated. Those using the app completed an additional 549 exercise repetitions during their admission (694 supplemental app‐based repetitions vs 146 supplemental paper‐based repetitions in the control group, mean difference [MD] 549, 95% CI 95 to 1002, p = 0.02) and an additional 157 min in supplemental exercise throughout their admission (195.3 min vs 38.7 min, MD 157 min, 95% CI 0.9‐312.3 min, p = 0.05). There was insufficient power to demonstrate statistical significance in functional outcomes, but a trend towards improved functional outcomes was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion: An app‐based exercise program increases activity levels, is feasible and is a safe intervention with the potential to improve functional outcomes. This pilot study should be followed with a larger study powered to demonstrate functional effects with more participants having greater impairment. Trial registration: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR); trial number ACTRN12617000817347. This study was retrospectively registered (registration date 05/06/2017).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Text messaging has successfully supported smoking cessation. This study compares a mobile application with text messaging to support smoking cessation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Young adult smokers 18‐30 years old (n = 102) participated in a randomized pretest‐posttest trial. Smokers received a smartphone application (REQ‐Mobile) with short messages and interactive tools or a text messaging system (onQ), managed by an expert system. Self‐reported usability of REQ‐Mobile and quitting behavior (quit attempts, point‐prevalence, 30‐day point‐prevalence, and continued abstinence) were assessed in posttests. RESULTS: Overall, 60% of smokers used mobile services (REQ‐Mobile, 61%, mean of 128.5 messages received; onQ, 59%, mean of 107.8 messages), and 75% evaluated REQ‐Mobile as user‐friendly. A majority of smokers reported being abstinent at posttest (6 weeks, 53% of completers; 12 weeks, 66% of completers [44% of all cases]). Also, 37% (25%of all cases) reported 30‐day point‐prevalence abstinence, and 32% (22% of all cases) reported continuous abstinence at 12 weeks. OnQ produced more abstinence (p<0.05) than REQ‐Mobile. Use of both services predicted increased 30‐day abstinence at 12 weeks (used, 47%; not used, 20%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: REQ‐Mobile was feasible for delivering cessation support but appeared to not move smokers to quit as quickly as text messaging. Text messaging may work better because it is simple, well known, and delivered to a primary inbox. These advantages may disappear as smokers become more experienced with new handsets. Mobile phones may be promising delivery platforms for cessation services using either smartphone applications or text messaging.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Mobile applications on smartphones can communicate a large amount of personalized, real‐time health information, including advice on skin cancer prevention, but their effectiveness may be affected by whether recipients can be convinced to use them. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a smartphone mobile application (Solar Cell) delivering real‐time advice about sun protection for a second time in a randomized clinical trial. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A previous trial conducted in 2012 used a randomized pretest‐posttest design. For the present trial, we collected data from a volunteer sample of 202 adults 18 years or older who owned a smartphone. Participants were recruited nationwide through online promotions. Screening procedures and a 3‐week run‐in period were added to increase the use of the mobile application. We conducted follow‐ups at 3 and 8 weeks after randomization to examine the immediate and the longer‐term effects of the intervention. INTERVENTIONS: Use of the mobile application. The application gave feedback on sun protection (ie, sun‐safety practices and the risk for sunburn) and alerted users to apply or to reapply sunscreen and to get out of the sun. The application also displayed the hourly UV Index and vitamin D production based on the forecast UV Index, time, and location. MAINOUTCOMES ANDMEASURES: Percentage of days with the use of sun protection, time spent outdoors in the midday sun (days and hours), and the number of sunburns in the last 3 months. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group used wide‐brimmed hats more at 7 weeks than control participants (23.8% vs 17.4%; F = 4.07; P =.045). Women who used the mobile application reported using all sun protection combined more than men (46.4% vs 43.3%; F = 1.49; P =.04), whereas men and older individuals reported less use of sunscreen (32.7% vs 35.5%; F = 5.36; P =.02) and hats (15.6% vs 17.9%; F = 4.72; P =.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The mobile application initially appeared to confer weak improvement of sun protection. Use of the mobile application was greater than in a previous trial and was associated with greater sun protection, especially among women. Strategies to increase the use of the mobile application are needed if the application is to be deployed effectively to the general adult population.

AB  - Self‐monitoring (SM) of food intake is central to weight loss treatment. Technology makes it possible to reinforce this behavior change strategy by providing real‐time feedback (FB) tailored to the diary entry. To test the feasibility of providing 1–4 daily FB messages tailored to dietary recordings via a smartphone, we conducted a 12‐week pilot randomized clinical trial in Pittsburgh, PA in US in 2015. We compared 3 groups: SM using the Lose It! smartphone app (Group 1); SM + FB (Group 2); and SM + FB + attending three in‐person group sessions (Group 3). The sample (N = 39) was mostly white and female with a mean body mass index of 33.76 kg/m2. Adherence to dietary SM was recorded daily, weight was assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. The mean percentage of days adherent to dietary SM was similar among Groups 1, 2, and 3 (p = 0.66) at 53.50% vs. 55.86% vs. 65.33%, respectively. At 12 weeks, all groups had a significant percent weight loss (p < 0.05), with no differences among groups (− 2.85% vs. − 3.14% vs. − 3.37%) (p = 0.95); 26% of the participants lost ≥ 5% of their baseline weight. Mean retention was 74% with no differences among groups (p = 0.37). All groups adhered to SM at levels comparable to or better than other weight loss studies and lost acceptable amounts of weight, with minimal intervention contact over 12 weeks. These preliminary findings suggest this 3‐group approach testing SM alone vs. SM with real‐time FB messages alone or supplemented with limited in‐person group sessions warrants further testing in a larger, more diverse sample and for a longer intervention period.

AB  - Self‐tracking via fitness apps is popular and has been described as a means to enhance body awareness and well‐being. However, the effects of fitness‐app use and specific app functions on well‐being and body awareness have yet to be targeted in controlled experimental studies. In two randomized groups, a fitness tracker was used for 6 weeks, and in one group a daily step target was implemented. In a third control group, participants documented their physical activity. A daily diary method was used to measure well‐being and body trusting. In Bayesian multilevel analyses, no time, group, or interaction effects were found. These results were robust when controlling for diverse variables. It can be concluded that exercise‐related self‐tracking and specific step goals do not substantially influence psychological well‐being and body trusting. Considering the large variability in effects, potential effects can be assumed under conditions that are to be identified in further studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of the Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a smartphone app to improve stress coping skills, suicidal ideation, and perceived reasons for living among patients at elevated risk of suicide and self‐harm. METHODS: The authors conducted a parallel‐group randomized controlled trial with two groups of U.S. service veterans in active mental health treatment who had recently expressed suicidal ideation. Between March 2014 and April 2015, 118 patients were enrolled in the study. Participants were assigned to use the VHB (N=58) or to a control group that received printed materials about coping with suicidality (N=60) to supplement treatment as usual over a 12‐week period. Three measures‐the Coping Self‐Efficacy Scale, Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, and Brief Reasons for Living Inventory‐were collected at baseline (before randomization) and three, six, and 12 weeks. Secondary measures‐the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, and Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale‐were collected at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: VHB users reported significantly greater ability to cope with unpleasant emotions and thoughts (Coping Self‐Efficacy Scale) at three (b=2.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.29‐4.55) and 12 weeks (b=2.99, 95% CI=.08‐5.90) compared with the control group. No significant advantage was found on other outcome measures for treatment augmented by the VHB. CONCLUSIONS: The VHB is a demonstrably useful accessory to treatment‐an easily accessible tool that can increase stress coping skills. Because the app is easily disseminated across a large population, it is likely to have broad, positive utility in behavioral health care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of mobile application (app) interventions on weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials examining the use of mobile app interventions with outcomes on weight loss evaluated by body weight or other measures such as BMI or waist circumference. A random-effects model was applied to obtain weight mean differences and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Fourteen studies enrolling 2,129 patients with type 2 diabetes were included. Mobile app interventions could significantly reduce body weight (weight mean difference, -0.84 kg; 95% CI: -1.51 to -0.17 kg) and lower waist circumference (-1.35 cm; 95% CI: -2.16 to -0.55 cm) but may not decrease BMI (-0.08 kg/m2 ; 95% CI: -0.41 to 0.25 kg/m2 ). The reductions appeared to be more pronounced in patients with obesity or among studies using mobile app interventions combined with other behavior components. However, weight loss was not moderated by the functionalities of the mobile apps (all Pinteraction > 0.05) or by the intervention duration (all P > 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Mobile app interventions lead to weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes and are worth recommending for weight loss promotion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of mobile phone applications (apps) on glycemic control (HbA1c) in the self-management of diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Relevant studies that were published between 1 January 1996 and 1 June 2015 were searched from five databases: Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase. Randomized controlled trials that evaluated diabetes apps were included. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) of the evidence. RESULTS: Participants from 14 studies (n = 1,360) were included and quality assessed. Although there may have been clinical diversity, all type 2 diabetes studies reported a reduction in HbA1c. The mean reduction in participants using an app compared with control was 0.49% (95% Cl 0.30, 0.68; I2 = 10%), with a moderate GRADE of evidence. Subgroup analyses indicated that younger patients were more likely to benefit from the use of diabetes apps, and the effect size was enhanced with health care professional feedback. There was inadequate data to describe the effectiveness of apps for type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Apps may be an effective component to help control HbA1c and could be considered as an adjuvant intervention to the standard self-management for patients with type 2 diabetes. Given the reported clinical effect, access, and nominal cost of this technology, it is likely to be effective at the population level. The functionality and use of this technology need to be standardized, but policy and guidance are anticipated to improve diabetes self-management care.

AB  - Background: Smoking cessation is a persistent leading public health challenge. Mobile health (mHealth) solutions are emerging to improve smoking cessation treatments. Previous approaches have proposed supporting cessation with tailored motivational messages. Some managed to provide short‐term improvements in smoking cessation. Yet, these approaches were either static in terms of personalization or human‐based nonscalable solutions. Additionally, long‐term effects were neither presented nor assessed in combination with existing psychopharmacological therapies. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the long‐term efficacy of a mobile app supporting psychopharmacological therapy for smoking cessation and complementarily assess the involved innovative technology. Methods: A 12‐month, randomized, open‐label, parallel‐group trial comparing smoking cessation rates was performed at Virgen del Rocío University Hospital in Seville (Spain). Smokers were randomly allocated to a control group (CG) receiving usual care (psychopharmacological treatment, n=120) or an intervention group (IG) receiving psychopharmacological treatment and using a mobile app providing artificial intelligence–generated and tailored smoking cessation support messages (n=120). The secondary objectives were to analyze health‐related quality of life and monitor healthy lifestyle and physical exercise habits. Safety was assessed according to the presence of adverse events related to the pharmacological therapy. Per‐protocol and intention‐to‐treat analyses were performed. Incomplete data and multinomial regression analyses were performed to assess the variables influencing participant cessation probability. The technical solution was assessed according to the precision of the tailored motivational smoking cessation messages and user engagement. Cessation and no cessation subgroups were compared using t tests. A voluntary satisfaction questionnaire was administered at the end of the intervention to all participants who completed the trial. Results: In the IG, abstinence was 2.75 times higher (adjusted OR 3.45, P=.01) in the per‐protocol analysis and 2.15 times higher (adjusted OR 3.13, P=.002) in the intention‐to‐treat analysis. Lost data analysis and multinomial logistic models showed different patterns in participants who dropped out. Regarding safety, 14 of 120 (11.7%) IG participants and 13 of 120 (10.8%) CG participants had 19 and 23 adverse events, respectively (P=.84). None of the clinical secondary objective measures showed relevant differences between the groups. The system was able to learn and tailor messages for improved effectiveness in supporting smoking cessation but was unable to reduce the time between a message being sent and opened. In either case, there was no relevant difference between the cessation and no cessation subgroups. However, a significant difference was found in system engagement at 6 months (P=.04) but not in all subsequent months. High system appreciation was reported at the end of the study. Conclusions: The proposed mHealth solution complementing psychopharmacological therapy showed greater efficacy for achieving 1‐year tobacco abstinence as compared with psychopharmacological therapy alone. It provides a basis for artificial intelligence–based future approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the use of information communication technologies to treat obesity. An intervention delivered by smartphone could be a convenient, potentially cost‐effective, and wide‐reaching weight management strategy. Although there have been studies of texting‐based interventions and smartphone applications (apps) used as adjuncts to other treatments, there are currently no randomized controlled trials (RCT) of a stand‐alone smartphone application for weight loss that focuses primarily on self‐monitoring of diet and physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to collect acceptability and feasibility outcomes of a self‐monitoring weight management intervention delivered by a smartphone app, compared to a website and paper diary. METHODS: A sample of 128 overweight volunteers were randomized to receive a weight management intervention delivered by smartphone app, website, or paper diary. The smartphone app intervention, My Meal Mate (MMM), was developed by the research team using an evidence‐based behavioral approach. The app incorporates goal setting, self‐monitoring of diet and activity, and feedback via weekly text message. The website group used an existing commercially available slimming website from a company called Weight Loss Resources who also provided the paper diaries. The comparator groups delivered a similar self‐monitoring intervention to the app, but by different modes of delivery. Participants were recruited by email, intranet, newsletters, and posters from large local employers. Trial duration was 6 months. The intervention and comparator groups were self‐directed with no ongoing human input from the research team. The only face‐to‐face components were at baseline enrollment and brief follow‐up sessions at 6 weeks and 6 months to take anthropometric measures and administer questionnaires. RESULTS: Trial retention was 40/43 (93%) in the smartphone group, 19/42 (55%) in the website group, and 20/43 (53%) in the diary group at 6 months. Adherence was statistically significantly higher in the smartphone group with a mean of 92 days (SD 67) of dietary recording compared with 35 days (SD 44) in the website group and 29 days (SD 39) in the diary group (P<.001). Self‐monitoring declined over time in all groups. In an intention‐to‐treat analysis using baseline observation carried forward for missing data, mean weight change at 6 months was ‐4.6 kg (95% CI ‐6.2 to ‐3.0) in the smartphone app group, ‐2.9 kg (95% CI ‐4.7 to ‐1.1) in the diary group, and ‐1.3 kg (95% CI ‐2.7 to 0.1) in the website group. BMI change at 6 months was ‐1.6 kg/m(2) (95% CI ‐2.2 to ‐1.1) in the smartphone group, ‐1.0 kg/m(2) (95% CI ‐1.6 to ‐0.4) in the diary group, and ‐0.5 kg/m(2) (95% CI ‐0.9 to 0.0) in the website group. Change in body fat was ‐1.3% (95% CI ‐1.7 to ‐0.8) in the smartphone group, ‐0.9% (95% CI ‐1.5 to ‐0.4) in the diary group, and ‐0.5% (95% CI ‐0.9 to 0.0) in the website group. CONCLUSIONS: The MMM app is an acceptable and feasible weight loss intervention and a full RCT of this approach is warranted.

AB  - Background: Obesity is a major global public health issue due to its association with a number of serious chronic illnesses and its high economic burden to health care providers. Self-monitoring of diet has been consistently linked to weight loss. However, there is limited evidence about how frequently individuals need to monitor their diet for optimal weight loss. Objective: The aim of this paper is to describe app usage frequency and pattern in the mobile phone arm of a previously conducted randomized controlled trial. The relationship between frequency and pattern of electronic dietary self-monitoring and weight loss is also investigated. Methods: A randomized pilot trial comparing three methods of self-monitoring (mobile phone app, paper diary, Web-based) was previously conducted. Trial duration was 6 months. The mobile phone app My Meal Mate features an electronic food diary and encourages users to self-monitor their dietary intake. All food consumption data were automatically uploaded with a time and date stamp. Post hoc regression analysis of app usage patterns was undertaken in the My Meal Mate group (n = 43; female: 77%, 33/43; white: 100%, 43/43; age: mean 41, SD 9 years; body mass index: mean 34, SD 4 kg/m2) to explore the relationship between frequency and pattern of electronic dietary self-monitoring and weight loss. Baseline characteristics of participants were also investigated to identify any potential predictors of dietary self-monitoring. Results: Regression analysis showed that those in the highest frequency-of-use category (recorded >= 129 days on the mobile phone app) had a -6.4 kg (95% CI -10.0 to -2.9) lower follow-up weight (adjusted for baseline weight) than those in the lowest frequency-of-use category (recorded <= 42 days; P < .001). Long-term intermittent monitoring over 6 months appeared to facilitate greater mean weight loss than other patterns of electronic self-monitoring (ie, monitoring over the short or moderate term and stopping and consistently monitoring over consecutive days). Participant characteristics such as age, baseline weight, sex, ethnicity, conscientiousness, and consideration of future consequences were not statistically associated with extent of self-monitoring. Conclusions: The results of this post hoc exploratory analysis indicate that duration and frequency of app use is associated with improved weight loss, but further research is required to identify whether there are participant characteristics that would reliably predict those who are most likely to regularly self-monitor their diet.

AB  - Background: Relationship Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (ROCD) is a presentation of OCD centering on interpersonal relationships. The aim of this Randomized Control Trial (RCT) was to assess the efficacy of short, game like, daily cognitive interventions delivered via mobile application in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated phenomena. Methods: Fifty university students identified as having subclinical levels of ROCD symptoms (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐5 Clinical Version) were randomized into: immediate‐use group (iApp group; n = 25) and delayed‐use group (dApp group; n = 25). The iApp group started using the evaluated cognitive‐behavioral training application at baseline for 15 days (T0 to T1). The dApp group commenced using the application at T1 for 15 days (T1 to T2). All participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 15 days from baseline (T1), and 30 days from baseline (T2). Results: Repeated measure MANOVAs showed significant Group (iApp vs. dApp) × Time (T0 vs. T1) interactions. These interactions indicated greater decrease in ROCD symptoms, OCD beliefs and social anxiety symptoms, as well as a greater increase in self‐esteem in the iApp group compared to dApp group at T1. Moreover, the Reliable Change Index (RCI) indicated reliable change on ROCD symptoms for a significant portion of participants (42–52%). Limitations: Sample size and the use of self‐report measures limits the generalizability of the results. Conclusions: Short, daily cognitive training interventions delivered via mobile applications may be useful in reducing subclinical ROCD symptoms and associated features. Further testing is needed for clinical populations.

AB  - Body dissatisfaction is prevalent in young women, and is associated with symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and eating disorders (EDs). The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a mobile application, based on cognitive behavioral principles, in reducing body dissatisfaction and BDD/ED symptoms in female university students considered at high‐risk of developing body image disorders (BIDs). Fifty university students at high‐risk of developing BIDs (using self‐report questionnaires assessing BIDs and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐5 Clinical Version) were randomized in two groups: immediate‐use App group (iApp group; n = 25) and delayed‐use App group (dApp group; n = 25). The iApp group started using the app at baseline for 16 days (T0 to T1). The dApp group waited for 16 days before starting to use the app (T1 to T2). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0), 16 days from baseline (T1), and 32 days from baseline (T2). Repeated measure Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) showed a Group (iApp vs. dApp) × Time (T0 vs. T1) interaction on BDD symptoms indicating medium effect size (partial eta squared) reductions in the iApp group compared to dApp group at T1; post‐intervention means for BDD symptoms were under the cut‐off for extreme body dissatisfaction/BDD symptoms in both groups. Pertaining to ED symptoms, no significant Group × Time interaction was detected. Training 3 minutes a day for 16 days with a CBT‐based mobile application may lead to reductions in some forms of body dissatisfaction, including BDD symptoms in female university students at high‐risk of developing BIDs. On the other hand, effects of the intervention on ED symptoms seem more limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous evidence suggests that mindfulness training may improve aspects of psychosocial well‐being. Whilst mindfulness is traditionally taught in person, consumers are increasingly turning to mindfulness‐based smartphone apps as an alternative delivery medium for training. Despite this growing trend, few studies have explored whether mindfulness delivered via a smartphone app can enhance psychosocial well‐being within the general public. METHODS: The present pilot randomised controlled trial compared the impact of engaging with the self‐guided mindfulness meditation (MM) app 'Headspace' (n = 38) for a period of 10 or 30 days, to a wait‐list (WL) control (n = 36), using a cohort of adults from the general population. The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Wagnild Resilience Scale were administered online at baseline and after 10 and 30 days of the intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants (MM n = 9, WL n = 3) were lost to follow‐up for unknown reasons. Relative to the WL control, the MM app positively impacted self‐reported satisfaction with life, stress, and resilience at day 10, with further improvements emerging at day 30 (Cohen's d = 0.57, 1.42, 0.63 respectively). The rate of improvement was largest at the 10‐day assessment point, dropping moderately by day 30. Participants that rated the MM app as easy to engage with experienced the largest self‐reported benefits. Moreover, the MM app was able to protect against an unexpected increase in perceived stress that emerged in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot randomised controlled trial shows that self‐reported improvements in psychosocial outcomes can be achieved at low cost through short‐term engagement with a mindfulness‐based smartphone app, and should be followed up with more substantive studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of social media and mobile health (mHealth) apps has been increasing in pregnancy care. However, the effectiveness of these interventions is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effectiveness of these interventions with regard to different health outcomes in pregnant and postpartum women and investigate the characteristics and components of interventions that may affect program effectiveness. METHOD: We performed a comprehensive literature search of major electronic databases and reference sections of related reviews and eligible studies. A random effects model was used to calculate the effect size. RESULTS: Fifteen randomized controlled trial studies published in and before June 2018 that met the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The interventions were effective in promoting maternal physical health including weight management, gestational diabetes mellitus control, and asthma control with a moderate to large effect size (d=0.72). Large effect sizes were also found for improving maternal mental health (d=0.84) and knowledge about pregnancy (d=0.80). Weight control interventions using wearable devices were more effective. CONCLUSION: Social media and mHealth apps have the potential to be widely used in improving maternal well-being. More large-scale clinical trials focusing on different health outcomes are suggested for future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone‐based psychoeducation interventions may be a low‐cost, user‐friendly alternative to resource‐consuming, face‐to‐face antenatal classes to educate expectant mothers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to empirically examine whether such an intervention would lead to reduced postnatal depression, anxiety, or stress and result in a better health‐related quality of life. METHODS: A single‐blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hong Kong. All first‐time expectant mothers with less than 24 weeks of gestation remaining and attending the antenatal clinic at a public hospital were included. Participants were assigned to the intervention group or the control group by drawing lots. The lots, presented in sealed opaque envelopes, were randomly designated as "intervention" or "control" by stratified randomization. The intervention, a psychoeducational mobile app, was provided in addition to the treatment as usual (TAU) services from the hospital. Follow up with participants took place at 4 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was the difference in the levels of antenatal and postnatal depression, assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The intention‐to‐treat approach was employed in the analyses. RESULTS: The final sample was 660 expectant mothers (nintervention=330 and ncontrol=330). The mean difference in EPDS scores between the two groups was ‐0.65 (95% CI ‐1.29 to 0.00; P=.049) after adjusting for confounding factors. Associations were found between participation in the intervention and reduced depression, and attendance in TAU classes and increased stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: The smartphone‐based intervention plus TAU services was effective in reducing postnatal depression at 4 weeks postpartum compared with a control condition of TAU only, making this a cost‐effective alternative to TAU education for expectant mothers. Limitations of the study included the short postpartum period after which the follow‐up assessment was conducted and the inclusion of first‐time mothers rather than all mothers.

AB  - Background Despite its efficacy in treating comorbid insomnia and depression, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is limited in its accessibility and, in many countries, cultural compatibility. Smartphone-based treatment is a low-cost, convenient alternative modality. This study evaluated a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in alleviating major depression and insomnia. Methods A parallel-group randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was conducted with 320 adults with major depression and insomnia. Participants were randomized to receive either a 6-week CBT-I via a smartphone application, proACT-S, or waitlist condition. The primary outcomes included depression severity, insomnia severity, and sleep quality. The secondary outcomes included anxiety severity, subjective health, and acceptability of treatment. Assessments were administered at baseline, post-intervention (week 6) follow-up, and week 12 follow-up. The waitlist group received treatment after the week 6 follow-up. Results Intention to treat analysis was conducted with multilevel modeling. In all but one model, the interaction between treatment condition and time at week 6 follow-up was significant. Compared with the waitlist group, the treatment group had lower levels of depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): Cohen's d = 0.86, 95% CI (-10.11 to -5.37)], insomnia [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): Cohen's d = 1.00, 95% CI (-5.93 to -3.53)], and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A): Cohen's d = 0.83, 95% CI (-3.75 to -1.96)]. They also had better sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): Cohen's d = 0.91, 95% CI (-3.34 to -1.83)]. No differences across any measures were found at week 12, after the waitlist control group received the treatment. Conclusion proACT-S is an efficacious sleep-focused self-help treatment for major depression and insomnia. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04228146.

AB  - (1) Background: Hypertension (HTN) affects ~50% of adults and is a major risk factor for stroke and cardiovascular disease. In 2017, the SPRINT trial outcomes led to lowering of HTN cutoffs by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA). The Joint National Committee (JNC8) and National High BP Education Program recommend that lifestyle modifications be used as first‐line HTN treatment. Chronic stress is a risk factor for HTN and cardiovascular disease. A recently completed 12 month randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a breathing meditation smart phone app (Tension Tamer, TT) involving JNC8 designated pre‐HTN adults provided an opportunity to examine its impact upon individuals now classified as having stage 1 HTN. The TT app captures continuous real‐time heart rate (HR) from a user's fingertip placed over a video camera lens during sessions. Users receive immediate feedback graphs after each session, showing their HR changes. They also receive motivational and social reinforcement SMS text messages the following day based upon levels of adherence. We conducted ancillary analyses of a 2‐arm, 12‐month, small‐scale efficacy RCT among a subgroup of our total sample of participants, who are now classified as having stage 1 non‐medicated systolic HTN. Primary outcome was change in resting systolic blood pressure (SBP). Secondary outcomes were change in resting diastolic blood pressure, adherence to the TT protocol, and perceived stress levels. (2) Methods: 30 adults (mean age: 45.0 years; 15 males; 16 White; 14 Black) with ACC/AHA 2017 defined systolic HTN (130‐139 mmHg) on 3 consecutive sessions (mean SBP: 132.6 mmHg) were randomly assigned to TT or lifestyle education program delivered via smartphone (SPCTL). Each group received a twice‐daily dosage schedule of TT or walking (month 1: 15 min; months 2 and 3: 10 min; months 4‐12: 5 min). (3) Results: Mixed modeling results revealed a significant group x time effect for SBP (p<.01). The TT group showed greater SBP reductions at months 3 (‐8.0 vs. ‐1.9), 6 (‐10.0 vs. ‐0.7), and 12: (‐11.6 vs. ‐0.4 mmHg; all p‐values <0.04). (4) Conclusion: The TT app was beneficial in reducing SBP levels among adults with stage 1 systolic HTN. The TT app may be a promising, scalable first‐line tactic for stage 1 HTN. Preparations are underway for an efficacy RCT involving uncontrolled stage 1 HTN patients.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) application, based on self‐regulation theory, on patients' knowledge of wound care, skills in changing dressings and anxiety. DESIGN: A prospective randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Seventy patients (or family members) at a 1,500‐bed university hospital in Taiwan were randomized into an experimental (N = 35) or control group (N = 35) from March to December 2016. The experimental group used a mHealth application for wound care; the control group received verbal instructions and a booklet. Instruments to collect data were a wound care knowledge scale, wound care skills scale, State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a digital heart variability device. Data were collected at baseline, after three additional demonstrations and before discharge. The generalized estimating equation was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The experimental group showed significantly higher levels of wound care knowledge, improved wound care skills, lower levels of state anxiety, and lower heart rate variability than the control group after baseline data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Results support hat a mHealth application may be effective in health education. Clinicians can use the results to promote patients' wound care knowledge, enhance their wound care skills, and reduce anxiety related to dressing changes. IMPACT: Lack of wound care knowledge and skills can affect the willingness and ability to perform effective wound dressing changes, producing anxiety and having an impact on a patient's self‐care after hospital discharge. mHealth applications (apps) have the potential to deliver health information in targeted and tailored ways that strengthen the self‐management of diseases. mHealth app can increase wound care knowledge, improve care skills, and reduce anxiety related to wound care. mHealth app effectively supports self‐monitoring of the wound healing process, self‐judgement of the wound condition, and self‐reaction of wound care accuracy. mHealth app provides step‐by‐step visual tutorials on wound care that allow patients and family caregivers to take pictures of the wounds and monitor the wound healing process. mHealth app for wound care knowledge is an effective and individualized method for learning. CLINICAL TRIAL: This study was registered by U.S. National Library of Medicine, ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03683303).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recovery from stress is a predictive factor for cardiovascular health, and heart rate variability (HRV) is suggested to be an index of how well people physiologically recover from stress. Biofeedback and mindfulness interventions that include guided breathing have been shown to be effective in increasing HRV and facilitating stress recovery. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a brief app‐based breathing intervention (BioBase) in enhancing physiological recovery among employees who were induced to cognitive and emotional stress. METHODS: In total, we recruited 75 full‐time employees. Interbeat (RR) intervals were recorded continuously for 5 min at baseline and during cognitive and emotional stress induction. The session ended with a 5‐min recovery period during which participants were randomly allocated into 3 conditions: app‐based breathing (BioBase), mindfulness body scan, or control. Subjective tension was assessed at the end of each period. RESULTS: Subjective tension significantly increased following stress induction. HRV significantly decreased following the stress period. In the recovery phase, the root mean square of successive RR interval differences (P=.002), the percentage of successive RR intervals that differed by >50 ms (P=.008), and high frequency (P=.01) were significantly higher in the BioBase breathing condition than in the mindfulness body scan and the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Biofeedback breathing interventions digitally delivered through a commercially available app can be effective in facilitating stress recovery among employees. These findings contribute to the mobile health literature on the beneficial effects of brief app‐based breathing interventions on employees' cardiovascular health.

AB  - Introduction: Postprandial hyperglycemia is independently associated with many adverse complications, while diets with a low glycemic load are beneficial in improving post‐meal glucose levels. This study aims to determine if mobile‐app‐based low‐carbohydrate dietary guidance will reduce exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia in adults with prediabetes. Methods: This single‐blind, randomized controlled pilot study included 100 participants (39 men; mean age 53.6 ± 11.9 years) and was performed in the PKU Care CNOOC Hospital, China. The intervention group (n = 57) received low‐carbohydrate dietary guidance through a moblie app (CAReNA) for 3 months, while the control group (n = 43) only received health education on a diabetic diet. The primary outcome was change in time of postprandial hyperglycemia between baseline and 3 months. Results: The study revealed that the mean time in postprandial hyperglycemia (> 7.8 mmol/l [140 mg/dl]) monitored by flash glucose monitoring changed from 3.27 h/day at baseline to 2.34 h/day at 3 months in the intervention group and from 3.08 h/day to 2.96 h/day in the control group, with a between‐group difference of − 0.81 h/day (P < 0.05). Fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the intervention group decreased significantly, although no significant difference was seen between the two groups. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had a significant decrease in anthropometric and body composition measurements as well as triglycerides. Conclusion: The mobile‐app‐based low‐carbohydrate dietary guidance effectively reduced the time spent in postprandial hyperglycemia in adults with prediabetes. This new type of nutritional management has beneficial effects on people with prediabetes and needs further research. Clinical Trial Registration: ChiCTR1900024880.

AB  - BACKGROUND Postpartum depression is a common health problem for women following childbirth. Using effective social support to reduce postpartum depression has become an important issue. The current popularity of smartphones offers new possibilities for interventional methods. PURPOSE To investigate the effects of mobile-application-based social support programs on perceived stress and postpartum depression in postpartum women. METHODS The present study employs an experimental research design. 126 smartphone users at 36 weeks' gestation were assigned randomly to the intervention (n = 61) or the control (n = 65) group. The intervention group received a social-support intervention via the mobile application Line twice per week for a period of 4 weeks after childbirth. The control group did not receive the intervention. The Perceived Stress Scale-Chinese version and Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale were used to evaluate the outcome. RESULTS Participants in the intervention group had significantly lower perceived stress (F = 27.25, p < .001) and postpartum depression (F = 35.73, p < .001) than their control group peers. CONCLUSIONS Social-support programs that are delivered via mobile applications such as Line may significantly reduce the perceived stress and postpartum depression of women during the early postpartum period. The results support the implementation of mobile-application-based social support programs in postpartum care.

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) is emerging as the most convenient way to deliver rehabilitation services remotely, and collect outcomes in real time, thus contributing to disease management by transferring care from hospital to home. It facilitates accessibility to healthcare, enhances patients' understanding of their condition, and their willingness to engage in self‐management, giving way to high‐quality care to the satisfaction of both patients and healthcare professionals. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of using a smartphone app (called Snapcare) on pain and function in patients suffering from chronic low back pain. Methods: Ninety‐three patients with chronic low back pain were recruited and randomly allocated to either the Conventional group (n = 48) receiving a written prescription from the Physician, containing a list of prescribed medicines and dosages, and stating the recommended level of physical activity (including home exercises) or the App group (n = 45) receiving Snapcare, in addition to the written prescription. Pain and disability were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: Both the groups showed significant improvement in pain and disability (p < 0.05). The App group showed a significantly greater decline in disability (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Health applications are promising tools for improving outcomes in patients suffering from various chronic conditions. Snapcare facilitated increase in physical activity and brought about clinically meaningful improvements in pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain.

AB  - Mobile health (M‐Health) has become a novel method for HIV prevention and the effects need to be promoted. The study purpose was to exam how a smartphone application (app) reduces HIV risky behaviour in men who have sex with men (MSM). The Safe Behaviour and Screening (SBS) app was developed, and included five features: record, output, and resources connection; information provision; testing services; interaction; and online statistics. A random assignment was used. The experimental group used the SBS app for six months. The control group did not use any intervention. There were 130 participants in the experimental group, and 135 in the control group. The average age of all subjects was 27.38 (SD = 5.56). Compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly higher mean score of safe behaviour knowledge, motivation, and skills; percentage of condom use during anal intercourse; frequency of searching for testing resources and getting HIV and syphilis tests. The frequency of anal intercourse and recreational drug usage were significantly lower in the experimental group. The SBS app could decrease the HIV risky behaviour among MSM and be applied to HIV prevention and nursing intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic disorders are established precursors to cardiovascular diseases, yet they can be readily prevented with sustained lifestyle modifications. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effectiveness of a smartphone‐based weight management app on metabolic parameters in adults at high‐risk, yet without physician diagnosis nor pharmacological treatment for metabolic syndrome, in a community setting. METHODS: In this 3‐arm parallel‐group, single‐blind, randomized controlled trial, we recruited participants aged 30 to 59 years with at least 2 conditions defined by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program expert panel (abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high fasting glucose level). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by block randomization to either the nonuser group (control), the app‐based diet and exercise self‐logging group (app only), or the app‐based self‐logging and personalized coaching from professional dieticians and exercise coordinators group (app with personalized coaching). Assessments were performed at baseline, week 6, week 12, and week 24. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure (between baseline and follow‐up assessments). Secondary outcomes were changes in diastolic blood pressure, body weight, body fat mass, waist circumference, homeostatic model of assessment of insulin resistance, triglyceride level, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol level between baseline and follow‐up assessments. Analysis was performed using intention‐to‐treat. RESULTS: Between October 28, 2017 and May 28, 2018, 160 participants participated in the baseline screening examination. Participants (129/160, 80.6%) who satisfied the eligibility criteria were assigned to control (n=41), app only (n=45), or app with personalized coaching (n=43) group. In each group, systolic blood pressure showed decreasing trends from baseline (control: mean ‐10.95, SD 2.09 mmHg; app only: mean ‐7.29, SD 1.83 mmHg; app with personalized coaching: mean ‐7.19, SD 1.66 mmHg), yet without significant difference among the groups (app only: P=.19; app with personalized coaching: P=.16). Instead, those in the app with personalized coaching group had greater body weight reductions (control: mean ‐0.12, SD 0.30 kg; app only: mean ‐0.35, SD 0.36 kg, P=.67; app with personalized coaching: mean ‐0.96, SD 0.37 kg; P=.08), specifically by body fat mass reduction (control: mean ‐0.13, SD 0.34 kg; app only: mean ‐0.64, SD 0.38 kg, P=.22; app with personalized coaching: mean ‐0.79, SD 0.38 kg; P=.08). CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous diet and exercise self‐logging and persistent lifestyle modification coaching were ineffective in lowering systolic blood pressure but effective in losing weight and reducing body fat mass. These results warrant future implementation studies of similar models of care on a broader scale in the context of primary prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to provide intensive, repetitive, and task‐oriented training, and game‐based therapy can enhance patients' motivation and enjoyment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to develop a mobile game‐based upper extremity VR program for patients who have experienced stroke, and to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the program. METHODS: This randomized, double‐blind, controlled trial included 24 patients with ischemic stroke. The intervention group (n = 12) received 30 min of conventional occupational therapy (OT) and 30 min of the mobile upper extremity rehabilitation program using a smartphone and a tablet PC (MoU‐Rehab). The controls (n = 12) received conventional OT alone for 1 h per day. Rehabilitation consisted of 10 sessions of therapy, 5 days per week, for 2 weeks. The outcome measures (Fugl‐Meyer Assessment of the upper extremity [FMA‐UE], Brunnström stage [B‐stage] for the arm and the hand, manual muscle testing [MMT], modified Barthel index [MBI], EuroQol‐5 Dimension [EQ‐5D], and Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]) were assessed at the beginning and end of treatment, and at 1 month. User satisfaction was evaluated by a questionnaire. RESULTS: A greater improvement in the FMA‐UE, B‐stage, and MMT was found after treatment with the MoU‐Rehab than with conventional therapy. The extent of improvements in the MBI, EQ‐5D, and BDI was not significantly different between the two groups. Patients in the experimental group completed the 2‐weeks treatment without adverse effects, and they were generally satisfied with MoU‐Rehab. CONCLUSION: This mobile game‐based VR rehabilitation program appears to be feasible and effective for promoting upper limb recovery after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Background
Randomized controlled trials conducted in Mediterranean countries demonstrate lower cardiovascular events with change to a Mediterranean diet. We tested the hypothesis that counseling supplied through a custom smartphone app (APP) will result in better adherence to a Mediterranean diet in a non-Mediterranean population when compared to traditional standard-of-care counseling (SOC).

Methods
100 patients presenting to a cardiology clinic in our academic medical center were randomized after 1 hour of face-to-face dietary counseling with a registered dietician. APP received a smartphone application that reinforced the Mediterranean diet; SOC received an additional 30 minutes of counseling at month 1 and 30 minutes at month 3. Visits with a research coordinator at months 1, 3, and 6 assessed diet adherence by validated instrument (MDS), blood pressure, weight, laboratory biomarkers, and satisfaction survey.

Results
Mean age was 56.6 ± 1.7 (SE) for SOC; 57.2 ± 1.8 for APP. Males were 65.3% in SOC; 56.9% in APP (p=ns). 20.4% of SOC and 35.3% of APP had coronary artery disease (p=ns). There were no differences between APP and SOC for blood pressure, lipid parameters, HgbA1C, or CRP. APP patients had greater weight loss than SOC (3.3 lbs vs. 3.1 lbs, p=0.04). MDS increased significantly in both groups from 7.1 ± 0.2 to 8.5 ± 0.4 in SOC and 7.2 ± 0.3 to 8.8 ± 0.5 in APP (p<0.001) but no difference between groups (p=0.69). Diet satisfaction similarly increased significantly in both SOC and APP but no difference between groups. High compliance with Mediterranean diet as defined by an MDS≥9 increased significantly from 18.4 to 57.1% in SOC and 27.5 to 64.7% in APP (p<0.0001) but no differences between groups.

Conclusion
Both traditional standard-of-care and smartphone-based counseling were effective in getting patients to adhere to a Mediterranean diet in this US-based study of cardiology patients, and these dietary changes persisted even after counseling had ended. However, neither method was more effective than the other. This study demonstrates that the American cardiology patient can change and maintain their diet to a Mediterranean one, whether through traditional counseling or a smartphone app.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials conducted in Mediterranean countries have shown that the Mediterranean diet lowers adverse cardiovascular events. In the American population, diet remains the biggest uncontrolled risk factor for cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that asynchronous dietary counseling supplied through a custom smartphone app results in better adherence to a Mediterranean diet in a non‐Mediterranean population than traditional standard‐of‐care (SOC) counseling. METHODS: In total, 100 patients presenting to the cardiology clinic of an academic medical center were randomized to either the SOC or smartphone app‐based experimental (EXP) Mediterranean diet intervention after informed consent and 1 hour of individual face‐to‐face dietary counseling with a registered dietitian. Participants in EXP received a custom smartphone app that reinforced the Mediterranean diet, whereas participants in SOC received 2 additional sessions of in‐person dietary counseling with the registered dietitian‐30 min at 1 month and 30 min at 3 months. Preexisting knowledge of a Mediterranean diet was measured by the validated Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) instrument. Baseline height, weight, blood pressure (BP), and laboratory biomarkers were collected. At 1, 3, and 6 months, participants presented for a follow‐up appointment to assess compliance to the Mediterranean diet using the MDS as well as a patient satisfaction survey, BP, and weight. Repeat laboratory biomarkers were performed at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Enrolled participants had a mean age with SE of 56.6 (SD 1.7) for SOC and 57.2 (SD 1.8) for EXP; 65.3% of SOC and 56.9% of EXP were male, and 20.4% of SOC and 35.3% of EXP had coronary artery disease. There were no significant differences between EXP and SOC with regard to BP, lipid parameters, hemoglobin A1c, or C‐reactive protein (CRP). Participants in EXP achieved a significantly greater weight loss on average of 3.3 pounds versus 3.1 pounds for participants in SOC, P=.04. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased significantly over time for both groups (P<.001), but there was no significant difference between groups (P=.69). Similarly, there was no significant difference in diet satisfaction between EXP and SOC, although diet satisfaction increased significantly over time for both groups. The proportion of participants with high Mediterranean diet compliance (defined as the MDS ≥9) increased significantly over time (P<.001)‐from 18.4% to 57.1% for SOC and 27.5% to 64.7% for EXP; however, there was no significant difference between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both traditional SOC counseling and smartphone‐based counseling were effective in getting participants to adhere to a Mediterranean diet, and these dietary changes persisted even after counseling had ended. However, neither method was more effective than the other. This pilot study demonstrates that patients can change to and maintain a Mediterranean diet with either traditional or smartphone app‐based nutrition counseling.

AB  - OBJECTIVES:: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of smartphone‐assisted self‐rehabilitation in patients with frozen shoulder. DESIGN:: A single‐center, randomized controlled trial. SETTING:: Orthopedic department of a university hospital. SUBJECTS:: A total of 84 patients with frozen shoulder were recruited. INTERVENTION:: Patients were randomly divided into two groups: a smartphone‐assisted exercise group ( n = 42) and a conventional self‐exercise group ( n = 42). The study was performed over three months, during which each group performed home‐based rehabilitation. MAIN MEASURES:: Visual analogue scale for pain and passive shoulder range of motion were assessed at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Technology Acceptance Model‐2 and Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use scores were evaluated in the smartphone group. RESULTS:: Initial visual analogue scale for pain of the smartphone group was 6.0 ± 2.2 and ended up with 1.8 ± 2.5 after 12 weeks, whereas the self‐exercise group showed 5.8 ± 2.3 for the baseline visual analogue scale for pain and 2.2 ± 1.7 at the end. Significant time‐dependent improvements in all measured values were observed in both groups (all Ps < 0.001), but no significant intergroup difference was observed after 4, 8, or 12 weeks of treatment. In the smartphone group, Technology Acceptance Model‐2 and Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use scores showed high patient satisfaction with smartphone‐assisted exercise. CONCLUSION:: There was no difference between home‐based exercise using a smartphone application and a conventional self‐exercise program for the treatment of frozen shoulder in terms of visual analogue scale for pain and range of motions.

Web‐based and mobile‐based interventions targeting agoraphobia may provide a solution to this problem, but there is a lack of research investigating the efficacy of such interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of a self‐guided mobile‐based intervention primarily targeting agoraphobic symptoms, with respect to a generic mobile app targeting anxiety. METHODS: A Web‐based randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared a novel mobile app designed to target agoraphobia (called Agoraphobia Free) with a mobile app designed to help with symptoms of anxiety in general (called Stress Free). Both interventions were based on established cognitive behavioral principles. We recruited participants (N=170) who self‐identified as having agoraphobia and assessed them online at baseline, midpoint, and end point (posttreatment) over a period of 12 weeks. The primary outcome was symptom severity measured by the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale. RESULTS: Both groups had statistically significant improvements in symptom severity over time (difference ‐5.97, 95% CI ‐8.49 to ‐3.44, P<.001 for Agoraphobia Free and ‐6.35, 95% CI ‐8.82 to ‐3.87, P<.001 for Stress Free), but there were no significant between‐group differences on the primary outcome (difference 0.38, 95% CI ‐1.96 to 3.20, P=.64). CONCLUSIONS: This is, to our knowledge, the first RCT to provide evidence that people who identify as having agoraphobia may equally benefit from a diagnosis‐specific and a transdiagnostic mobile‐based intervention. We also discuss clinical and research implications for the development and dissemination of mobile mental health apps.

AB  - DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles, AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Pharmacists report high levels of burnout. Mindfulness approaches have been demonstrated to have positive results in the general population and in other healthcare professions. However, limited studies have been performed evaluating mindfulness approaches in student pharmacists. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of daily use of a mindfulness mobile application in improving student pharmacists' perceived stress, burnout, and mindfulness. METHODS: This study was a randomized, longitudinal, waitlist-controlled trial. The intervention group was asked to meditate using the mindfulness application Headspace daily for at least 6 weeks. The waitlist control group was asked to abstain from using the application for the entire study. Stress, burnout, and mindfulness were assessed using validated survey instruments at baseline, 6 weeks, and 10 weeks. A secondary outcome was to assess the persistence of application use after the intervention period. RESULTS: Fifty-six participants completed the study. The intervention group reported significantly lower scores on stress and burnout at 6 weeks compared to the control group. The intervention group also reported significantly higher scores on mindfulness. The differences in stress, burnout, and mindfulness persisted at follow-up. The mean percentage of students in the intervention group who used the application each day was 90% over the intervention period and 62% over the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: A mindfulness mobile application significantly improved student pharmacists' stress, burnout, and mindfulness with daily use. Most participants continued to use the application for 4 weeks after the end of the intervention. Positive effects on stress and mindfulness persisted even with decreased use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the low retention and lack of persistent support by traditional tobacco cessation programs, evidence-based smartphone app-supported interventions can be an important tobacco control component. The objective of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate the types of studies that use smartphone apps for interventions in tobacco cessation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of PubMed (1946-2019), EMBASE (1974-2019), and PsycINFO (1806-2019) databases with keywords related to smartphone-supported tobacco cessation. Included articles were required to meet 3 baseline screening criteria: 1) be written in English, 2) include an abstract, and 3) be a full, peer-reviewed manuscript. The criteria for the second level of review were: 1) primary outcome of tobacco cessation, 2) intervention study, and 3) smartphone app as primary focus of study. RESULTS: Of 1973 eligible manuscripts, 18 met inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 17) recruited adult participants (18 + years); one included teens (16 + years). Tobacco cessation was usually self-reported (n = 11), compared to biochemical verification (n = 3) or both (n = 4). There were 11 randomized controlled trials, 4 of which reported statistically significant results, and 7 single-arm trials that reported a mean abstinence rate of 33.9%. DISCUSSION: The majority of studies that use tobacco cessation apps as an intervention delivery modality are mostly at the pilot/feasibility stage. The growing field has resulted in studies that varied in methodologies, study design, and inclusion criteria. More consistency in intervention components and larger randomized controlled trials are needed for tobacco cessation smartphone apps.

AB  - Abstract Background The aim of this study was to determine the effect of e-mobile education on the quality of life of women diagnosed with breast cancer who received endocrine hormone therapy. Methods The study was conducted as a randomized controlled study between January and July 2018 in the Medical Oncology Outpatient Clinic of a state hospital in the province of Turkey.A total of 64 patients were included in the study according to the inclusion criteria of randomization, split into treatment (n = 31) and control group (n = 33).Data were collected using Patient Introductory Information Form, FACT-ES Quality of Life Scale and NCCN Distress Thermometer.The data were collected twice during the first week of the study and 12th week at the end of the study by face-to-face and/or telephone interviews.Treatment group patients were received information via mobile application for three months during which they were contacted in every 15 days; e-mobile training was provided, including information about breast cancer definition, treatment process, symptoms experienced during endocrine hormone therapy, adequate nutrition, regular physical activity and coping with stress. Results The mean total quality of life after e-mobile training to the treatment group was found to be significantly higher than the control group, and the mean distress score was lower than the control group (p Conclusions As a result of the study, it has been concluded the quality of life of the patients increased when nurses use the e-mobile training and counseling in order to manage the disease process and symptoms of the women diagnosed with breast cancer and who are receiving endocrine hormone therapy with the help of the developing technologies and using the mobile technologies.

AB  - Background: Mobile applications are playing an increasing role in patient care, and their use in the oncologic field opens up promising possibilities in the fields of supportive cancer care and patient education. The objective of our study was to determine the effects on quality of life (QOL) of a mobile app–based training for supportive care of women with breast cancer using adjuvant endocrine hormonal therapy. Material and Methods: A single-blinded and randomized design was used. Participants were randomly assigned to either control group that receives routine care or intervention group that receives routine care plus access to mobile app–based training support for 12 weeks. QOL and symptom distress were measured before intervention (T0), after 12 weeks (T1) of intervention. This study is the application of three modality combinations: mobile app-based patient education (1), web-based management application (2), and nurse’s tracking over the phone and mobile app (3). The mobile app-based training also provides basic information about breast cancer, symptom diary and lifestyle recommendations (adequate and balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, deal with stress effectively). Results: QOL of the treatment group after intervention increased and distress level was low compared to the control group; these results were statistically significant. The majority of the patients reported that the mobile application was “informative and useful”. Conclusions: This demonstrated that the mobile app is an effective intervention for supportive care in women with breast cancer. The mobile app–based training, which is an innovative intervention, is recommended as a supportive care initiative for women with breast cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery is one of the most common orthopedic procedures. One of the main factors that influence the outcome is regaining strength in the postoperative phase. Because anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgeries are often performed in young patients, we combined the concept of prehabilitation with an app-based serious gaming approach to improve maximal strength postoperatively. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a prospective randomized trial to evaluate whether an app-based active muscle training program (GenuSport Knee Trainer) can improve postoperative strength by starting rehabilitation immediately after primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery. METHODS: We designed a pilot study in which we randomly assigned patients receiving primary anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to either the serious gaming training (intervention) group or a conventional rehabilitation (control) group. Except for the serious gaming-based training, both groups followed the same postoperative treatment protocol. Outcome parameters were absolute and relative change in maximal strength, as well as the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee evaluation form, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and Lysholm Knee Score. RESULTS: In total 26 patients agreed to participate (14 patients in the intervention group and 12 patients in the control group, 1 of whom was lost to follow-up). We noted a difference in absolute maximum strength between the exergaming intervention and the control groups. Mean maximum strength preoperatively was 155.1 (SD 79.2) N in the intervention group (n=14) and 157.0 (SD 40.8) N in the control group (n=11). Postoperative mean maximum strength was 212.8 (SD 78.5) N in the intervention group and 154.5 (SD 27.1) N in the control group. Mean absolute change in maximum strength was 57.7 (SD 95.2) N in the intervention group and -4.8 (22.2) N in the control group. The analysis of covariance model with absolute change as the dependent variable and treatment group and baseline maximum strength as covariates showed a relevant difference in relative change between treatment groups (intervention - control) of 59.7 N (95% CI 10.1-109.3; P=.02). Similarly to the absolute increase, the relative change in maximum strength was relevantly higher in the exergaming group. The mean relative change in maximum strength was 1.7 (SD 1.17) in the intervention group and 1 (SD 0.13) in the control group. No adverse events or problems were reported during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an app-based active muscle training program in the early postoperative therapy scheme was associated with an improvement in maximal strength. Therefore, we considered the use of GenuSport training after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to be a helpful complement to rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery to improve strength in the early postoperative phase. To our knowledge this was the first study to analyze immediate postoperative serious gaming-based training with the GenuSport device based on strength improvement.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable mortality. The use of mobile phones has grown exponentially, becoming a powerful tool to be used in health care. METHODS: In order to assess the effectiveness of mobile phones to quit smoking, we have carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials evaluating interventions based on mobile applications for smartphones, that were not a smaller version of the same application, against other types of therapy. To address this, a bibliographic search was carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE LIBRARY. To obtain the combined effect, the relative risk and the 95% confidence interval were used. A heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: A total of nine studies were identified, but five were excluded. Qualitative review was performed with four selected studies, but quantitative analysis was carried out for only three, given the impossibility of calculating the RR in one of the studies. After combining the results, an RR of 0.901 (95% CI: 0.57-1.423) was calculated comparing the effectiveness of mobile applications versus others type of interventions. This measure was robust, as shown by the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, it cannot be concluded that apps are effective for quitting tobacco. There are very few clinical trials published evaluating the effectiveness of mobile applications compared to other alternatives. Several clinical trials are still in progress, therefore their results have not been included in the present meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the availability and use of mobile mental health apps has grown exponentially in recent years, little data are available regarding their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an app developed to promote stress management and well‐being among working women compared with a control app. METHODS: Female employees at a private hospital were invited to participate in the study via mailing lists and intranet ads. A total of 653 individuals self‐enrolled through the website. Eligible participants were randomized between control (n=240) and intervention (n=250) groups. The well‐being mobile app provides an 8‐week program with 4 classes per week (including a brief theoretical portion and a 15‐min guided practice). The active control app also provided 4 assessments per week that encouraged participants to self‐observe how they were feeling for 20 min. We also used the app to conduct Web‐based questionnaires (10‐item Perceived Stress Scale and 5‐item World Health Organization Well‐Being Index) and ask specific questions to assess subjective levels of stress and well‐being at baseline (t1), midintervention (t4=4 weeks after t1) and postintervention (t8=8 weeks after t1). Both apps were fully automated without any human involvement. Outcomes from the control and intervention conditions at the 3 time points were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Among the randomized participants (n=490), 185 participants were excluded at the 4‐week follow‐up and another 79 at the 8‐week follow‐up because of noncompliance with the experimental protocol. Participants who did not complete t4 and t8 assessments were equally distributed between groups (t4: control group=34.6% [83/240] and intervention group=40.8% [102/250]; P=.16; t8: control group=29.9% [47/157] and intervention group=21.6% [32/148]; P=.10). Both groups showed a significant increase in general well‐being as a function of time (F2,426=5.27; P=.006), but only the intervention group presented a significant increase in work‐related well‐being (F2,426=8.92; P<.001), as well as a significant reduction in work‐related and overall stress (F2,426=5.50; P=.004 and F2,426=8.59; P<.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The well‐being mobile app was effective in reducing employee stress and improving well‐being.

AB  - In K-12 school districts, principals impact student learning, influence campus culture, and play a role in retaining highly qualified classroom teachers. Almost half of school principals resign or change positions by the third year in the role (School Leaders Network, 2014). The true experimental study included a total of 78 principals, representing 17 of the 20 educational regions in Texas. Participants randomly assigned to the treatment group were asked to use Mindfulness Coach smartphone application for a period of four weeks. To determine if mindfulness intervention impacted stress levels, participants from both the control group and treatment group completed a pre-survey and post-survey measuring stress levels and perceived levels of mindfulness. Findings revealed that principals with higher levels of perceived mindfulness had lower levels of stress. The relationship between mindfulness and principal stress should be researched further to determine if a statistical significance between mindfulness intervention and stress is achieved. This study is intended to provide support for principals, superintendents, and principal preparation programs to provide strategies for principals in the area of managing high levels of stress and reducing attrition rates among the profession.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Electronic patient‐reported outcomes (ePROs) transmitted digitally allow patients to communicate with their clinicians and track the activity of chronic diseases, such as RA. Several ePRO smartphone apps have been developed in rheumatology, yet few data have been reported regarding patient adherence. We developed a PRO app for RA and assessed adherence over 6 months. METHODS: We developed an app to deliver daily assessments to participants (RA App v.1.0). The app was tested as part of a randomized controlled trial examining potential clinical benefits. The current analyses focus on the adherence to the ePRO app for patients randomized to receive the app. We recruited RA patients from an academic rheumatology practice in the USA. Patients randomized to receive the app received daily notifications regarding ePROs. We examined adherence to the PRO questionnaires over the 6‐month study and examined factors related to adherence. RESULTS: Seventy‐eight patients received the app and have data included in these analyses: 63 (80.7%) were female, mean age was 55.2 years, 71% had attended college or beyond, and the mean Clinical Disease Activity Index at baseline was 9.7 (low disease activity). Median adherence to the daily questions was 79% (interquartile range 48‐90%). Significant predictors of increased adherence were age ≥65 (P = 0.03) and low baseline Clinical Disease Activity Index (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We developed and tested an ePRO app for RA over a 6‐month study. Adherence to the app was strong. There was correlation between older age and better disease control and increased adherence. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, https://clinicaltrials.gov/, NCT02822521.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to find a scientific evidence on the efficacy of apps in promoting healthy lifestyles. METHODS: The research was carried out according to PRISMA Statement. Pubmed, Embase and Google Scholar searches were carried out up to September 2016 focusing on randomized control trials (RCTs). RESULTS: Forty RCTs were selected. Most of the studies targeted weight management, PA and healthy eating (N=35). A few RCTs focused on apps designed to sun protection, smoking cessation and alcohol consumption (N=5). Only 10 RCTs (25%) found statistical difference between intervention and control groups for all the outcomes measured. Most of the studies had a short follow-up (65%, less than 6 months) and half of them a very small sample size (fewer than 100 subjects). CONCLUSION: Overall, the evidence so far showed a modest efficacy of apps in health promotion. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There is a need to improve the overall quality of intervention studies focused on mobile apps in order to understand if they could became a valuable tool in support of health professionals and their efforts to promote education and health.

AB  - Background: Although there are thousands of health and fitness smartphone apps currently available, little research exists regarding the effects of mobile app technology on physical activity behavior. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to test whether Exergame smartphone applications increase physical activity levels. Methods: This was a 12-week randomized, controlled, parallel group trial. The intervention consisted of the use of Exergame smartphone apps and motivational messaging. Validated instruments were used to measure physical activity, enjoyment, motivation, and competence. Results: Forty subjects were randomized and completed baseline assessments; 39 (97.5%) completed the 12-week follow-up. Median age was 32 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 25, 41.75); 85% were women. No differences between groups were identified in primary or secondary outcomes. Within group, physical activity decreased in the controls and autonomous motivation increased in the intervention group. Discussion: Exploratory findings were interesting regarding the use of Exergames to encourage physical activity. The intervention group showed less of a decline in activity, suggesting a possible attenuation of the observed seasonal fluctuation by the use of the Exergames. Translation to Health Education Practice Given their popularity, health educators should continue to explore the use of Exergame apps as a tool to facilitate physical activity.

AB  - Background Patients who are sick enough to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) commonly experience symptoms of psychological distress after discharge, yet few effective therapies have been applied to meet their needs. Methods Pilot randomised clinical trial with 3‐month follow‐up conducted at two academic medical centres. Adult (≥18 years) ICU patients treated for cardiorespiratory failure were randomised after discharge home to 1 of 3 month‐long interventions: A self‐directed mobile app‐based mindfulness programme; a therapist‐led telephone‐based mindfulness programme; or a web‐based critical illness education programme. Results Among 80 patients allocated to mobile mindfulness (n=31), telephone mindfulness (n=31) or education (n=18), 66 (83%) completed the study. For the primary outcomes, target benchmarks were exceeded by observed rates for all participants for feasibility (consent 74%, randomisation 91%, retention 83%), acceptability (mean Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 27.6 (SD 3.8)) and usability (mean Systems Usability Score 89.1 (SD 11.5)). For secondary outcomes, mean values (and 95% CIs) reflected clinically significant group‐based changes on the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (mobile (â '4.8 (â 6.6, â 2.9)), telephone (â 3.9 (â 5.6, â 2.2)), education (â 3.0 (â 5.3, 0.8)); the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (mobile â 2.1 (â 3.7, â 0.5), telephone â '1.6 (â '3.0, â '0.1), education â '0.6 (â '2.5, 1.3)); the Post‐Traumatic Stress Scale (mobile â '2.6 (â '6.3, 1.2), telephone â '2.2 (â '5.6, 1.2), education â '3.5 (â '8.0, 1.0)); and the Patient Health Questionnaire physical symptom scale (mobile â '5.3 (â '7.0, â '3.7), telephone â '3.7 (â '5.2, 2.2), education â '4.8 (â '6.8, 2.7)). Conclusions Among ICU patients, a mobile mindfulness app initiated after hospital discharge demonstrated evidence of feasibility, acceptability and usability and had a similar impact on psychological distress and physical symptoms as a therapist‐led programme. A larger trial is warranted to formally test the efficacy of this approach. Trial registration number Results, NCT02701361.

AB  - Introduction: Although as many as 75% of the >2 million annual intensive care unit (ICU) survivors experience symptoms of psychological distress that persist for months to years, few therapies exist that target their symptoms and accommodate their unique needs. In response, we developed LIFT, a mobile app‐based mindfulness intervention. LIFT reduced distress symptoms more than either a telephone‐based mindfulness program or education control in a pilot randomized clinical trial (LIFT1). Objective: To describe the methods of a factorial experimental clinical trial (LIFT2) being conducted to aid in the development and implementation of the version of the LIFT intervention that is optimized across domains of effect, feasibility, scalability, and costs. Methods and analysis: The LIFT2 study is an optimization trial conceptualized as a component of a larger multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) project. The goal of LIFT2 is to use a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial experimental trial involving 152 patients to determine the ideal components of the LIFT mobile mindfulness program for ICU survivors across factors including (1) study introduction by call from a therapist vs. app only, (2) response to persistent or worsening symptoms over time by therapist vs. app only, and (3) high dose vs. low dose. The primary trial outcome is change in depression symptoms 1 month from randomization measured by the PHQ‐9 instrument. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder, and physical symptoms; measures of feasibility, acceptability, and usability; as well as themes assessed through qualitative analysis of semi‐structured interviews with study participants conducted after follow up completion. We will use general linear models to compare outcomes across the main effects and interactions of the factors.

AB  - Background: Smartphone applications (apps) are popular aids for smoking cessation. Smoke Free is an app that delivers behaviour change techniques used in effective face‐to‐face behavioural support programmes. The aim of this study was to assess whether the full version of Smoke Free is more effective than the reduced version. Methods: This was a two‐arm exploratory randomised controlled trial. Smokers who downloaded Smoke Free were randomly offered the full or reduced version; 28,112 smokers aged 18+ years who set a quit date were included. The full version provided updates on benefits of abstinence, progress (days smoke free), virtual ‘badges’ and daily ‘missions’ with push notifications aimed at preventing and managing cravings. The reduced version did not include the missions. At baseline the app recorded users’: device type (iPhone or Android), age, sex, daily cigarette consumption, time to first cigarette of the day, and educational level. The primary outcome was self‐reported complete abstinence from the quit date in a 3‐month follow‐up questionnaire delivered via the app. Analyses conducted included logistic regressions of outcome on to app version (full versus reduced) with adjustment for baseline variables using both intention‐to‐treat/missing‐equals smoking (MES) and follow‐up‐only (FUO) analyses. Results: The 3‐month follow‐up rate was 8.5% (n=1,213) for the intervention and 6.5% (n=901) for the control. A total of 234 participants reported not smoking in the intervention versus 124 in the control, representing 1.6% versus 0.9% in the MES analysis and 19.3% versus 13.8% in the FUO analysis. Adjusted odds ratios were 1.90, 95%CI=1.53‐2.37 (p<0.001) and 1.50, 95%CI=1.18‐1.91 (p<0.001) in the MES and FUO analyses respectively. Conclusions: Despite very low follow‐up rates using in‐app follow up, both intention‐to‐treat/missing equals smoking and follow‐up only analyses showed the full version of the Smoke Free app to result in higher self‐reported 3‐month continuous smoking abstinence rates than the reduced version.

AB  - AIMS: The purpose is to determine the non‐inferiority of a smartphone‐based exercise educational care management system after primary knee arthroplasty compared with a traditional in‐person physiotherapy rehabilitation model. METHODS: A multicentre prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted evaluating the use of a smartphone‐based care management system for primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and partial knee arthroplasty (PKA). Patients in the control group (n = 244) received the respective institution's standard of care with formal physiotherapy. The treatment group (n = 208) were provided a smartwatch and smartphone application. Early outcomes assessed included 90‐day knee range of movement, EuroQoL five‐dimension five‐level score, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS JR) score, 30‐day single leg stance (SLS) time, Time up and Go (TUG) time, and need for manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA). RESULTS: Overall, 90‐day mean flexion was not significantly different between the control (121° (SD 11.7°)) and treatment groups (121o; p = 0.559); 90‐day mean SLS was 22.7 seconds (SD 9.8) in controls and 24.3 seconds (SD 20.8) in treatment (p = 0.519); 90‐day mean TUG times were 10.1 seconds (SD 4.8) in control and 9.3 seconds (SD 3.3) in treatment (p = 0.139). Mean KOOS JR scores were significantly different between control group (73.6 (SD 13.4)) and treatment group (70.4 (SD 12.6); p = 0.026). MUAs were performed in nine (3.7%) patients in the control group and four (1.9%) in the treatment group (p = 0.398). Physiotherapy was performed by 230 (94.4%) of control group and 123 (59.3%) of treatment group (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between groups in postoperative urgent care visits, or readmissions within 90 days, with significantly fewer emergency department visits in the treatment group (16 (8.2%) vs five (2.5%), p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: The use of the smartwatch/smartphone care platform demonstrated non‐inferiority of clinically significant outcomes to traditional care models, while requiring significantly less postoperative physiotherapy and fewer emergency department visits. This platform could aid in decreasing postoperative costs, while improving patient engagement and communication with the healthcare team. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2021;103‐B(6 Supple A):3‐12.

AB  - Introduction: Medication adherence improves symptoms and reduces exacerbation risk for COPD patients. Aims: To assess the impact of electronic reminders on adherence in COPD patients. Methods: The 6mo, open‐label, randomized, multicenter, phase 4 study (NCT02864342) enrolled 137 patients aged =40y with =10 pack‐year smoking history and moderate‐to‐very severe COPD in the US. Patients received BUD/FM pMDI 2 puffs of 160/4.5µg twice daily, BreatheMate device, and smartphone app (intervention group [INT, n=67] had audiovisual reminders; control group [CTRL, n=70] did not). The primary endpoint was the mean number of sets of adherent puffs/day (2 sets of 2 puffs/day, both puffs of a set within 60min, 4 puffs total) for 6mo. Secondary endpoints were Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) score, adherence for each 60d interval, usage days, and prescription refills. The study terminated early due to smartphone syncing issues. Results: INT had significantly more sets of adherent puffs/day (1.61 vs 1.33, P<0.001) and a higher percentage of adherent days (86.6% vs 66.1%, P<0.001) vs CTRL. For each 60d interval, adherence was higher for INT vs CTRL (P<0.05). INT was 3.07 (95% CI: 1.49‐6.52) times more likely to be adherent for =80% of days vs CTRL. INT had significantly lower numbers of no use, underuse (<2 sets of 2 puffs/day), and overuse (<2 sets of 2 puffs/day) days vs CTRL (P<0.05). Older age (=65y) was associated with higher adherence (P<0.001). CCQ scores were similar for INT and CTRL. Conclusions: Use of the BreatheMate application with reminders resulted in significantly higher adherence to inhaled therapy in COPD patients. Funded by AstraZeneca

AB  - Self‐management interventions in COPD aim to improve patients’ knowledge, skills and confidence to make correct decisions, thus improving health status and outcomes. myCOPD is a web‐based self‐management app known to improve inhaler use and exercise capacity in individuals with more severe COPD. We explored the impact of myCOPD in patients with mild–moderate or recently diagnosed COPD through a 12‐week, open‐label, parallel‐group, randomised controlled trial of myCOPD compared with usual care. The co‐primary outcomes were between‐group differences in mean COPD assessment test (CAT) score at 90 days and critical inhaler errors. Key secondary outcomes were app usage and patient activation measurement (PAM) score. Sixty patients were randomised (29 myCOPD, 31 usual care). Groups were balanced for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 % pred) but there was baseline imbalance between groups for exacerbation frequency and CAT score. There was no significant adjusted mean difference in CAT score at study completion, −1.27 (95% CI −4.47–1.92, p=0.44) lower in myCOPD. However, an increase in app use was associated with greater CAT score improvement. The odds of ⩾1 critical inhaler error was lower in the myCOPD arm (adjusted OR 0.30 (95% CI 0.09–1.06, p=0.061)). The adjusted odds ratio for being in a higher PAM level at 90 days was 1.65 (95% CI 0.46–5.85) in favour of myCOPD. The small sample size and phenotypic difference between groups limited our ability to demonstrate statistically significant evidence of benefit beyond inhaler technique. However, our findings provide important insights into associations between increased app use and clinically meaningful benefit warranting further study in real world settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions (mHealth) based on smartphone applications (apps) are promising tools to help improve diabetes care and self-management; however, more evidence on the efficacy of mHealth in diabetes care is needed. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of mHealth apps on changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood glucose, blood pressure, serum lipids, and body weight in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. METHODS: Two independent reviewers searched three online databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE) to identify relevant studies published between January 2005 and June 2016. Of the 2,596 articles retrieved, 13 RCTs were included. We used random effects model to estimate the pooled results. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were selected for the systematic review, six of which with data available containing 1,022 patients were included for the meta-analysis. There was a moderate effect on glycemic control after the mHealth app-based interventions. The overall effect on HbA1c shown as mean difference (MD) was -0.40% (-4.37 mmol/mol) (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.69 to -0.11% [-7.54 to -1.20 mmol/mol]; p = 0.007) and standardized mean differences (SMD) was -0.40% (-4.37 mmol/mol) (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.69 to -0.10% [-7.54 to -1.09 mmol/mol]; p = 0.008). A subgroup analysis showed a similar effect with -0.33% (-3.61 mmol/mol) (95% CI -0.59 to -0.06% [-6.45 to -0.66 mmol/mol]; p = 0.02) in MD and -0.38% (-4.15 mmol/mol) (95% CI -0.71 to -0.05% [-7.76 to -0.55 mmol/mol]; p = 0.02) in SMD in studies where patients' baseline HbA1c levels were less than 8.0%. No effects of mHealth app interventions were found on blood pressure, serum lipids, or weight. Assessment of overall study quality and publication bias demonstrated a low risk of bias among the six studies. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone apps offered moderate benefits for T2DM self-management. However, more research with valid study designs and longer follow-up is needed to evaluate the impact of mHealth apps for diabetes care and self-management.

AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this four-week randomized controlled pilot study were to determine, adjunctive to standard of care, which group (Headspace or Waitlist Control [WLC]) reported a greater improvement in pain-related physical functioning, an increase in mindfulness, and a decrease in aberrant medication related behavior from baseline to post-assessment among individuals with chronic low back or neck pain. Methods: Participants were recruited from a specialty pain clinic who reported chronic low back or neck pain for more than three months. Fifty-nine participants were randomized to Headspace (n = 29) or a WLC group (n = 30). Participants completed online assessments at two time points, baseline and post-assessment at week 4. Results: Analyses indicated no significant Group x Time interaction effects for pain-related physical functioning, mindfulness, or aberrant medication related behavior. Exploratory correlational analyses indicated no significant linear associations between total Headspace sessions completed and change scores in the outcome variables. Similarly, no significant linear associations were observed between total minutes of Headspace completed and change scores in the outcome variables. Conclusions: Overall, the non-significant findings may be related to the small sample size and low observed power. As a result of these limitations, the findings from this pilot study are insufficient to definitively add to the literature on mindfulness. The lack of power signals a demand for future research with larger samples in order to determine feasibility and acceptability of delivering a mindfulness meditation app adjunctive to standard of care for chronic pain populations.

AB  - Background: To address the need for disseminable, evidence‐based depression treatment options for Latinx adults with limited English proficiency (LEP), our team developed ¡Aptívate!, a Spanish‐language Behavioral Activation self‐help mobile application. Primary aims of this study were to: 1) examine feasibility and uptake of ¡Aptívate! among depressed Latinx adults with LEP and 2) preliminarily examine ¡Aptívate! efficacy for depression treatment. Methods: Participants (N = 42) with elevated depressive symptoms were randomized 2:1:1 to: 1) ¡Aptívate! (n = 22), 2) an active control Spanish‐language app (“iCouch CBT”; n = 9), or 3) Treatment As Usual (i.e., no app; n = 11). Feasibility was assessed via self‐reported app utilization and app analytics data. Depressive symptoms were assessed weekly for eight weeks via self report. Results: All ¡Aptívate! participants used the app at least once, 81.8% of participants used the app ≥8 times, and 36.4% of participants used the app ≥56 times. Weekly retention was strong: 72.7% and 50% of participants continued to use the app at one‐ and two‐months post‐enrollment, respectively. Generalized Estimating Equation models indicated a significant interaction between time and treatment, such that ¡Aptívate! participants reported significantly lower depressive symptoms over time than TAU. Depressive symptoms did not differ on average across time between the iCouch and TAU conditions, nor between iCouch and ¡Aptívate!. Limitations: Limitations include small sample size, limited follow‐up, and lack of analytics data for the active control condition. Conclusions: With further research, ¡Aptívate! may offer a feasible, efficacious approach to extend the reach of evidence‐based depression treatment for Latinx adults with LEP.

AB  - Mobile technologies can be leveraged to meet the need for evidence‐based psychological depression treatment via primary care. The purpose of the present study was to preliminarily examine the feasibility and efficacy of a self‐help brief behavioral activation mobile application (app; “Moodivate”) for depressive symptoms among adults treated via primary care. Participants (N = 52) were recruited from primary care practices between January and December 2017 and were randomized 2:2:1 to receive (a) Moodivate, (b) an active control cognitive‐behavioral therapy‐based mobile app (“MoodKit”), or (c) treatment as usual (TAU; no app). Participants completed assessments of depressive symptoms weekly for 8 weeks. App analytics data were captured to examine Moodivate feasibility (analytics unavailable for control app). Moodivate participants on average had 46.76 (SD = 30.10) app sessions throughout the trial duration, spent 3.50 (2.76) minutes using the app per session, and spent 120.76 (101.02) minutes using the app in total throughout the trial. Nearly 70% of Moodivate participants continued to use the app 1 month after trial enrollment and 50% at the end of the 8‐week follow‐up period. A generalized estimating equation model examining change in depressive symptoms over time by treatment condition indicated a significant interaction between time and treatment condition (χ2 = 42.21, df = 14, p < .001). As compared to TAU, participants in both app conditions evidenced significant decreases in depressive symptoms over time, and these treatment gains were sustained across the trial period. These results preliminarily indicate feasibility of Moodivate as well as efficacy of both Moodivate and MoodKit for the treatment of depression among adults recruited via primary care. Future studies should focus on larger‐scale examinations of treatment efficacy and effectiveness across primary care settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal morbidity and mortality are significant public health issues with an enduring impact on the health and well-being of women and their families. Millions of pregnant women now download and use mobile applications to access, store, and share health information. However, little is known about the consequences. An investigation of their impact on perinatal health outcomes is particularly topical. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of mobile app interventions during pregnancy on influencing healthy maternal behavior and improving perinatal health outcomes. METHODS: Searches of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, WHO Global Health Library, POPLINE, and CABI Global Health were conducted with no date or language restrictions. Randomized and non-randomized studies were included if they reported perinatal health outcomes of interventions targeting pregnant women, using mobile apps compared with other communication modalities or with standard care. The primary outcome measure was the change in maternal behaviors (as defined by trial authors), by intervention goals. Two reviewers independently extracted data using standardized forms. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 456 participants were included. All studies targeted participants in early pregnancy; however, wide variation was evident in participant characteristics, intervention, and study outcomes measures. Three trials were based in hospital settings, comparing women using mobile apps with routine antenatal care. One community-based trial gave all participants a device to promote physical activity; the intervention arm was also given a mobile app. All studies reported data for the primary outcome measure, describing some benefit from the intervention compared with controls. However, few statistically significant primary or secondary outcomes were reported. Due to insufficient data, the planned meta-analysis and subgroup analyses were not performed. CONCLUSIONS: Due to limited numbers, heterogeneity of interventions, comparators, and outcome measures, no firm conclusions can be drawn on the effects of mobile application interventions during pregnancy on maternal knowledge, behavior change, and perinatal health outcomes. As millions of women utilize mobile apps during pregnancy, rigorous studies are essential for health care and maternity care providers to optimally design, implement, and evaluate interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Smartphone applications (apps) for smoking cessation are becoming increasingly available, but their efficacy remains to be demonstrated. We conducted a pilot study of SmokeBeat, a novel app designed for use with smartwatches and wristbands. SmokeBeat is powered by a data analytics software platform that processes information from the sensors embedded in wearables. It relies on an original algorithm to identify in real time the hand‐to‐mouth gestures that characterize smoking a cigarette. We examined whether merely monitoring and notifying smokers on smoking episodes in real time via the SmokeBeat app would lead to reduction in smoking. Method(s): Forty smokers (9 women and 31 men) who expressed a wish to reduce or quit smoking were randomly assigned to using the SmokeBeat app for 30 days or to a wait‐list control group. All participants completed questionnaires at baseline and at the end of the study, including their level of smoking. Smokers in the experimental condition were notified whenever the SmokeBeat system detected a smoking episode and were asked to confirm or deny it. Result(s): The SmokeBeat algorithm correctly detected over 80% of the smoking episodes and produced very few false alarms. According to both self‐report and detection of smoking episodes by the SmokeBeat system, smokers in the experimental condition showed a significant decline in smoking rate over the 30‐day trial (p < .001). There was no change in the smoking rate of the control group. Conclusion(s): These preliminary results suggest that automatic monitoring of smoking episodes and alerting the smoker in real time may facilitate smoking reduction in motivated smokers. Implications: Raising the awareness of smokers to the act of smoking in real time, as the SmokeBeat app is able to do, can counter the automaticity of the smoking habit. Bringing smoking under conscious awareness may benefit smokers who are motivated to reduce or quit smoking to gain better control of their smoking behavior and reduce cigarette intake.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure have low quality of life because of physical impairments and advanced clinical symptoms. One of the main goals of caring for patients with heart failure is to improve their quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of a smartphone-based app on the quality of life of patients with heart failure. METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial with a control group was conducted from June to October 2018 in an urban hospital. In this study, 120 patients with heart failure hospitalized in cardiac care units were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups. Besides routine care, patients in the intervention group received a smartphone-based app and used it every day for 3 months. Both the groups completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire before entering the study and at 3 months after entering the study. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software V.16. RESULTS: The groups showed statistically significant differences in the mean scores of quality of life and its dimensions after the intervention, thereby indicating a better quality of life in the intervention group (P<.001). The effect size of the intervention on the quality of life was 1.85 (95% CI 1.41-2.3). Moreover, the groups showed statistically significant differences in the changes in the quality of life scores and its dimensions (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of a smartphone-based app can improve the quality of life in patients with heart failure. The results of our study recommend that digital apps be used for improving the management of patients with heart failure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and problematic alcohol use represent two of the major causes of disease burden in young adults. These conditions frequently co‐occur and this is associated with increased harm and poorer outcomes than either disorder in isolation. Integrated treatments have been shown to be effective; however, there remains a significant gap between those in need of treatment and those receiving it. The increased availability of eHealth programs presents a unique opportunity to treat these conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an automated Web‐based self‐help intervention (DEAL Project) in treating co‐occurring depressive symptoms and problematic alcohol use in young people. METHODS: Young people (aged 18 to 25 years) with moderate depression symptoms and drinking at hazardous levels (recruited largely via social media) were randomly allocated to the DEAL Project (n=60) or a Web‐based attention‐control condition (HealthWatch; n=44). The trial consisted of a 4‐week intervention phase with follow‐up assessment at posttreatment and at 3 and 6 months postbaseline. The primary outcomes were change in depression severity according to the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 as well as quantity and frequency of alcohol use (TOT‐AL). RESULTS: The DEAL Project was associated with statistically significant improvement in depression symptom severity (d=0.71) and reductions in alcohol use quantity (d=0.99) and frequency (d=0.76) in the short term compared to the control group. At 6‐month follow‐up, the improvements in the intervention group were maintained; however, the differences between the intervention and control groups were no longer statistically significant, such that between‐group effects were in the small to moderate range at 6 months (depression symptoms: d=0.39; alcohol quantity: d=‐0.09; alcohol frequency: d=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the DEAL Project was associated with more rapid improvement in both depression symptoms and alcohol use outcomes in young people with these co‐occurring conditions relative to an attention‐control condition. However, long‐term outcomes are less clear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that depression can be prevented; however, traditional approaches face significant scalability issues. Digital technologies provide a potential solution, although this has not been adequately tested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new smartphone app designed to reduce depression symptoms and subsequent incident depression amongst a large group of Australian workers. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with follow‐up assessments at 5 weeks and 3 and 12 months post‐baseline. Participants were employed Australians reporting no clinically significant depression. The intervention group (N = 1128) was allocated to use HeadGear, a smartphone app which included a 30‐day behavioural activation and mindfulness intervention. The attention‐control group (N = 1143) used an app which included a 30‐day mood monitoring component. The primary outcome was the level of depressive symptomatology (PHQ‐9) at 3‐month follow‐up. Analyses were conducted within an intention‐to‐treat framework using mixed modelling. RESULTS: Those assigned to the HeadGear arm had fewer depressive symptoms over the course of the trial compared to those assigned to the control (F3,734.7 = 2.98, p = 0.031). Prevalence of depression over the 12‐month period was 8.0% and 3.5% for controls and HeadGear recipients, respectively, with odds of depression caseness amongst the intervention group of 0.43 (p = 0.001, 95% CI 0.26‐0.70). CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates that a smartphone app can reduce depression symptoms and potentially prevent incident depression caseness and such interventions may have a role in improving working population mental health. Some caution in interpretation is needed regarding the clinical significance due to small effect size and trial attrition.Trial Registration Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (www.anzctr.org.au/) ACTRN12617000548336.

AB  - Stress and anxiety during pregnancy are associated with a range of adverse health outcomes, but there is an unmet need for low‐barrier treatments that target stress and anxiety. One such treatment approach, attention bias modification training (ABMT), targets the anxiety‐related threat bias, a disruption in attention to and neural processing of threat‐related information. It remains unclear, however, whether reducing treatment barriers via mobile delivery of ABMT is effective and whether ABMT efficacy varies depending on individual differences in neural processing of threat. The present study tested whether mobile, gamified ABMT reduced prenatal threat bias, anxiety and stress, and whether ABMT efficacy varied with individual differences in neural responses to threat. Participants were 29 women in their 19th‐29th week of pregnancy, randomized to four weeks of an ABMT or placebo training (PT) version of the mobile app using a double‐blind design. Self‐report of anxiety, depression, and stress were obtained; salivary cortisol was collected at home and in lab in response to stressors to index biological stress reactivity. Threat bias was measured using a computerized attention assay during which EEG was recorded to generate event‐related potentials (ERPs) to threat cues. Results showed lower levels of lab cortisol following ABMT versus PT. Although the main effect of ABMT on subjective anxiety was not significant, the magnitude of cortisol reduction was correlated with lower levels of subjective anxiety and threat bias. Those receiving ABMT also reported less anxiety when showing smaller ERPs to threat (P1, P2) prior to training, but, conversely reported more anxiety when showing larger ERPs to threat. Use of gamified, mobile ABMT reduced biobehavioral indices of prenatal stress and anxiety, but effects on anxiety varied with individual differences in cortisol response and neurocognitive indices of early attention to threat.

AB  - Background. Smartphone medical applications have a major role to play in women's health with their roles being very broad, ranging from improving health behaviours to undertaking personalised tests. Objective(s). Using Medline, Web of Knowledge, and the PRISMA guidelines 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified, with mobile interventions being tested on 1603 females, in relation to key aspects of health. Using a similar systematic approach an iPhone database search identified 47 applications (apps) developed to improve women's health. Findings. Ten RCTs used text messaging or app interventions to support weight loss, with significant improvements being observed in eight studies. For other aspects of women's health RCTs are needed to determine possible health benefits. iPhone store data analysis identified that a substantial number of women's health apps did not have star ratings or feedback comments (68 and 49 per cent, resp.), raising concerns about their validity. Conclusion. Peer-review systems, supporting statements of evidence, or certification standards would be beneficial in maintaining the quality and credibility of future health-focused apps. Patient groups should also ideally be involved in the development and testing of mobile medical apps.

AB  - Lung transplant recipients are encouraged to perform self‐management behaviors, including (i) monitoring health indicators, (ii) adhering to their regimen, and (iii) reporting abnormal health indicators to the transplant coordinator, yet performance is suboptimal. When hospital discharge was imminent, this two‐group trial randomized 201 recipients to use either the mobile health (mHealth) intervention (n = 99) or usual care (n = 102), to compare efficacy for promoting self‐management behaviors (primary outcomes) and self‐care agency, rehospitalization, and mortality (secondary outcomes) at home during the first year after transplantation. The mHealth intervention group performed self‐monitoring (odds ratio [OR] 5.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.95‐8.87, p < 0.001), adhered to medical regimen (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.01‐2.66, p = 0.046), and reported abnormal health indicators (OR 8.9, 95% CI 3.60‐21.99, p < 0.001) more frequently than the usual care group. However, the two groups did not differ in rehospitalization (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.36‐1.66, p = 0.51) or mortality (hazard ratio 1.71, 0.68‐4.28, p = 0.25). The positive impact of the mHealth intervention on self‐management behaviors suggests that the intervention holds promise and warrants further testing.

AB  - Objective:To investigate the interventional effect of smart‐phone application on development of complications of chemoradiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after discharge.Method:Sixty‐five NPC patients receving first chemoradiotherapy were randomly divided into two groups. Control group including 33 patients, use traditional oral Health education. Intervention group including 32 patients, use a smart‐phone application after discharge. The smart‐phone application with text and graphics was established to conduct health education and dynamically manage discharged patients for promoting themselves health management. Poisonous side reactions and quality of life of two groups were investigated at discharge and 6 months after discharge.Result:There were not significant difference between two groups on complications of chemoradiotherapy and quality of life at discharge. After discharge 6 months, the incidence of oral mucositis, dry mouth, nasal obstruction and difficulty in opening mouth of intervention group were lower than control group significantly, while the quality of life of intervention group higher than control group significantly (P< 0.05). Conclusion:Smart‐phone application can reduce complications of chemoradiotherapy, and improve the quality of life in patients with NPC after discharge.

AB  - Background: We explored the intervention effect of a smartphone medical app on complications and quality of life of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Material/Methods: We divided 132 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who received radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the first time, in accordance with the random number table method, into a control group (67 patients) and an intervention group (65 patients). Patients in control group were discharged with standard care and patients in the intervention group used a smartphone medical app after discharge. Data on adverse effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, complications, and quality of life were collected and analyzed. Results: There was no difference between the complications of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and quality of life between the 2 groups at discharge (P>0.05). The incidence of oral mucositis, xerostomia, mouth‐opening difficulties, and nasal congestion in the intervention group was significantly lower than in the control group at 6 months after discharge and quality of life was significantly higher than in the control group (P<0.05). Conclusions: Reasonable use of this smartphone app can improve the exercise compliance of discharged patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, reduce the adverse reactions and complications of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and improve quality of life and satisfaction of patients after discharge.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the effectiveness of smartphone apps for the self-management of low back pain in adults. METHODS: Prospectively registered systematic review of randomised controlled trials (2008-) published in English. Studies investigating smartphone apps for the self-management of low back pain (adults ≥18 years), including ≥1 NICE low back pain and sciatica clinical guideline-recommended component and functioning without health professional input were included. Outcomes were pain, function, quality of life and adherence. RESULTS: Six studies were included (n = 2100 participants). All comparator groups incorporated some form of management (n = 3 physiotherapy, n = 2 GPs, n = 1 not specified). Three studies reported a significant decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group compared with the control. One study reported no significant difference between groups in pain self-efficacy. One study reported a significant reduction in disability (function) in the intervention group compared with the control. Two studies reported no between-group differences in quality of life. One study reported no correlation between adherence (app use) and change in pain intensity and one study reported that app use mediated the effect of teleconsultations on pain improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Inconclusive evidence exists for the use of smartphone applications for the self-management of low back pain. Further research is needed.Implications for RehabilitationSmartphone apps have the potential to improve outcomes for people with LBP aligned with current self-management guidelines.There is a paucity of literature exploring smartphone apps for LBP self-management and current evidence is inconclusive for smartphone app use without supported care.Commercially available smartphone apps are not well regulated for content or alignment with evidence-based guidelines and recommendations.Further evaluation of commercially available apps is required to guide and instil confidence in consumers and health professionals that consumer-accessible apps may lead to improved outcomes.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review to determine if the use of nutrition apps resulted in improved outcomes, including knowledge and behavior, among healthy adults. Using app(s), cellular phone, iPads, mobile phone, mobile telephone, smart phone, mobile and mHealth as search terms with diet, food and nutrition as qualifiers we searched PubMed, CINAHL (January 2008--October 2013) and Web of Science (January 2008--January 2014). Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials, non-controlled trials, and cohort studies published in English that used apps to increase nutrition knowledge or improve behavior related to nutrition. Studies that were descriptive, did not include apps, focused on app development, app satisfaction app feasibility, text messaging, or digital photography were excluded. We evaluated article quality using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Manual. Data was extracted for knowledge, behavior and weight change. Our initial search identified 12,010 titles from PubMed, 260 from CINAHL and 4762 from Web of Science; of these, only four articles met all search criteria. Positive quality ratings were given to three articles; only one reported knowledge outcomes (non-significant). All four articles evaluated weight loss and suggested an advantage to using nutrition apps. Behavioral changes in reviewed studies included increased adherence to diet monitoring (p < 0.001) and decreased effort to continue diet without app (p = 0.024). Few studies, however, have explored the use of nutrition apps as supportive educational interventions. Most apps focus on weight loss with inconsistent outcomes. We conclude that using apps for education needs additional research which includes behavior theory within the app and improved study design.

AB  - A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs) improves symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Reference Staudacher and Whelan1). Although it is recommended patients receive advice on a low FODMAP diet by a dietitian (Reference O'Keeffe and Lomer2), this is labour-intensive and costly, highlighting the need for alternative effective education delivery methods. This study aimed to establish the feasibility of undertaking a trial that assesses the clinical and cost effectiveness of different education delivery methods (leaflets vs mobile application vs one-to-one consultation with a dietitian) of the low FODMAP diet.

Patients diagnosed with IBS, functional bloating or functional diarrhoea based upon the Rome IV criteria were recruited in this parallel group, 4-week, feasibility randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to receive information about the low FODMAP diet using leaflets (leaflet), mobile application (app), or one-to-one consultation with a dietitian (dietitian). Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and retention rates, and acceptability of the interventions. Symptoms were assessed using the validated “adequate symptom relief” question and IBS-Symptom Scoring System (IBS-SSS). Analysis of variance was used to analyse continuous outcomes, and chi-squared test for categorical outcomes.

Fifty-one patients were randomised. Overall, recruitment rate was 2.4 patients/month and retention rates were 18/19 (95%) in the leaflet, 16/17 (94%) in the app and 14/15 (93%) in the dietitian group. A higher proportion of patients in the dietitian group (64%) strongly agreed they were “able to implement the low FODMAP diet” compared with the app (13%) and leaflet groups (6%; p = 0.008). More patients reported “adequate symptom relief” in the dietitian group (80%) compared to those in the leaflet group at follow up (39%, p = 0.026), but not compared to the app (63%). Although there was no significant difference in total IBS-SSS scores among the groups (p = 0.438), change in IBS-SSS from baseline was significantly greater in the dietitian group (-153 ± 90) compared to the leaflet group (-90 ± 56; p = 0.048), but not compared to the app (-120 ± 62). More patients in the leaflet group (83%) reported they would have preferred to have received a different education method compared with those in the app (44%) and dietitian groups (14%; p < 0.001).

To conclude, this feasibility study confirms that an adequately powered trial of the most clinically and cost-effective education delivery method for the low FODMAP diet is required. Preliminary evidence suggests that delivering low FODMAP diet advice through a one-to-one consultation with a dietitian improves functional bowel symptoms compared to leaflets, but not compared to the app.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to develop an animation‐supported Mobile Diabetic Foot Care Education (M‐DFCE) application for use by individuals with type 2 diabetes and identify its effects on knowledge, self‐efficacy and foot care behaviour. Design: Randomised, controlled experimental study. Setting and Method: The study was carried out between October 2016 and September 2017. The sample consisted of 130 individuals with diabetes (65 in the experimental group and 65 in the control group). The experimental group received M‐DFCE. Data were collected using the Patient Assessment Form, the Diabetes Foot Knowledge Questionnaire, the Diabetic Foot Care Self‐Efficacy Scale and the Foot Self‐Care Behaviour Scale. Differences between the groups were examined using Student’s t, Mann–Whitney U, Wilcoxon Signed Rank and Paired Sample tests. Results: Although there was no difference between the groups at initial evaluation, individuals in the experimental group who received animation‐supported M‐DFCE had significantly higher knowledge, self‐efficacy and foot care behaviour levels than the control group. Conclusion: The animation‐supported mobile application developed for foot care education was effective in increasing the individuals’ knowledge, self‐efficacy and behaviour with respect to foot care.

AB  - Background: End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is associated with many losses, subsequently impacting mental wellbeing. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for people with ESKD and none exist for Indigenous people, a population in which the ESKD burden is especially high. Methods: This three‐arm, waitlist, single‐blind randomised controlled trial examined efficacy of the Stay Strong App in improving psychological distress (Kessler distress scale; K10), depressive symptoms (adapted Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ‐9), quality of life (EuroQoL; EQ. 5D) and dialysis adherence among Indigenous Australians undergoing haemodialysis in central and northern Australia (Alice Springs and Darwin), with follow up over two 3‐month periods. Effects of immediate AIMhi Stay Strong App treatment were compared with those from a contact control app (The Hep B Story) and treatment as usual (TAU). Control conditions received the Stay Strong intervention after 3 months. Results: Primary analyses of the full sample (N = 156) showed statistically significant decreases in K10 and PHQ‐9 scores at 3 months for the Hep B Story but not for the Stay Strong app or TAU. Restricting the sample to those with moderate to severe symptoms of distress or depression (K10 > =25 or PHQ‐9 > =10) showed significant decreases in K10 and PHQ‐9 scores for both Stay Strong and Hep B Story. No significant differences were observed for the EQ‐5D or dialysis attendance. Conclusions: Findings suggest that talking to people about their wellbeing and providing information relevant to kidney health using culturally adapted, locally relevant apps improve the wellbeing of people on dialysis. Further research is required to replicate these findings and identify active intervention components. Trial registration: ACTRN12617000249358; 17/02/2017.

AB  - Our objective was to evaluate the impact of a smartphone application as an adjunct to face‐to‐face consultations in facilitating dietary and physical activity change among pregnant women. This multicentre, nested randomised trial involved pregnant women with a body mass index ≥18.5 kg/m2 , with a singleton pregnancy between 10 and 20 weeks' gestation, and participating in 2 pregnancy nutrition‐based randomised trials across metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. All women participating in the SNAPP trial received a comprehensive dietary, physical activity, and behavioural intervention, as part of the GRoW or OPTIMISE randomised trials. Women were subsequently randomised to either the "Lifestyle Advice Only Group," where women received the above intervention, or the "Lifestyle Advice plus Smartphone Application Group," where women were additionally provided access to the smartphone application. The primary outcome was healthy eating index (HEI) assessed by maternal food frequency questionnaire completed at trial entry, and 28 and 36 weeks' gestation. Analyses were performed using intention‐to‐treat principles, with statistical significance at p = .05. One hundred sixty‐two women participated: 77 allocated to the Lifestyle Advice plus Smartphone Application Group and 85 to the Lifestyle Advice Only Group. Mean difference in HEI score at 28 weeks of pregnancy was 0.01 (CI [‐2.29, 2.62]) and at 36 weeks of pregnancy ‐1.16 (CI [‐4.60, 2.28]). There was no significant additional benefit from the provision of the smartphone application in improving HEI score (p = .452). Although all women improved dietary quality across pregnancy, use of the smartphone application was poor. Our findings do not support addition of the smartphone application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriasis has a negative impact on patients' physical and mental health and can lead to anxiety and depression. Disease management strategies, including educational programs and eHealth devices, have been shown to improve health care for several chronic diseases. However, such disease management strategies are lacking in the routine care of patients with psoriasis. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to study the impact of a novel intervention that combines an educational program with a disease management smartphone app on the mental health of patients with psoriasis. METHODS: Patients with psoriasis in the intervention group received an educational program; attended visits on weeks 0, 12, 24, 36, and 60; and had access to the study app. Patients in the control group only attended the visits. The primary endpoint was a significant reduction of scores on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Secondary end points were reductions in Dermatology Life Quality Index score, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, pruritus, and pain, as well as improvements in mood and daily activities. In addition, modulating effects of sex, age, disease duration, and app use frequency were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients were included in the study and randomized into the control group (53/107, 49.5%) or intervention group (54/107, 50.5%). Approximately 71.9% (77/107) of the patients completed the study. A significant reduction in HADS‐Depression (HADS‐D) in the intervention group was found at weeks 12 (P=.04) and 24 (P=.005) but not at weeks 36 (P=.12) and 60 (P=.32). Patient stratification according to app use frequency showed a significant improvement in HADS‐D score at weeks 36 (P=.004) and 60 (P=.04) and in HADS‐Anxiety (HADS‐A) score at weeks 36 (P=.04) and 60 (P=.05) in the group using the app less than once every 5 weeks. However, in patients using the app more than once every 5 weeks, no significant reduction in HADS‐D (P=.84) or HADS‐A (P=.20) score was observed over the 60‐week study period compared with that observed in patients in the control group. All findings were independent of sex, age, and disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the use of a disease management smartphone app as a valid tool to achieve long‐term improvement in the mental health of patients with psoriasis if it is not used too frequently. Further studies are needed to analyze the newly observed influence of app use frequency. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien DRKS00020755; https://tinyurl.com/nyzjyvvk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High dietary sodium intake is a significant public health problem in the United States. High sodium consumption is associated with high blood pressure and high risk of cardiovascular disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a just‐in‐time adaptive mobile app intervention, namely, LowSalt4Life, on reducing sodium intake in adults with hypertension. METHODS: In this study, 50 participants aged ≥18 years who were under treatment for hypertension were randomized (1:1, stratified by gender) into 2 groups, namely, the App group (LowSalt4Life intervention) and the No App group (usual dietary advice) in a single‐center, prospective, open‐label randomized controlled trial for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was the change in the 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion estimated from spot urine by using the Kawasaki equation, which was analyzed using unpaired two‐sided t tests. Secondary outcomes included the change in the sodium intake measured by the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion, blood pressure levels, and the self‐reported confidence in following a low‐sodium diet. RESULTS: From baseline to week 8, there was a significant reduction in the Kawasaki‐estimated 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion calculated from spot urine in the App group compared to that in the No App group (‐462 [SD 1220] mg vs 381 [SD 1460] mg, respectively; P=.03). The change in the 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion was ‐637 (SD 1524) mg in the App group and ‐322 (SD 1485) mg in the No App group (P=.47). The changes in the estimated sodium intake as measured by 24‐hour dietary recall and by FFQ in the App group were ‐1537 (SD 2693) mg and ‐1553 (SD 1764) mg while those in the No App group were ‐233 (SD 2150) mg and ‐515 (SD 1081) mg, respectively (P=.07 and P=.01, respectively). The systolic blood pressure change from baseline to week 8 in the App group was ‐7.5 mmHg while that in the No App group was ‐0.7 mmHg (P=.12), but the self‐confidence in following a low‐sodium diet was not significantly different between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a contextual just‐in‐time mobile app intervention resulted in a greater reduction in the dietary sodium intake in adults with hypertension than that in the control group over a 8‐week period, as measured by the estimated 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion from spot urine and FFQ. The intervention group did not show a significant difference from the control group in the self‐confidence in following a low sodium diet and in the 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion or dietary intake of sodium as measured by the 24‐hour dietary recall. A larger clinical trial is warranted to further elucidate the effects of the LowSalt4Life intervention on sodium intake and blood pressure levels in adults with hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The successful management of heart failure (HF) involves guideline-based medical therapy as well as self-management behavior. As a result, the management of HF is moving toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the efficacy of enhanced self-management via a mobile app intervention on health-related quality of life, self-management, and HF readmissions. METHODS: A single-center randomized controlled trial was performed. Participants older than 45 years and admitted for acute decompensated HF or recently discharged in the past 4 weeks were included. The intervention group ("app group") used a mobile app, and the intervention prompted daily self-monitoring and promoted self-management. The control group ("no-app group") received usual care. The primary outcome was the change in Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score from baseline to 6 and 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the Self-Care Heart Failure Index (SCHFI) questionnaire score and recurrent HF admissions. RESULTS: A total of 83 participants were enrolled and completed all baseline assessments. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups except for the prevalence of ischemic HF. The app group had a reduced MLHFQ at 6 weeks (mean 37.5, SD 3.5 vs mean 48.2, SD 3.7; P=.04) but not at 12 weeks (mean 44.2, SD 4 vs mean 45.9, SD 4; P=.78), compared to the no-app group. There was no effect of the app on the SCHFI at 6 or 12 weeks. The time to first HF readmission was not statistically different between the app group and the no-app group (app group 11/42, 26% vs no-app group 12/41, 29%; hazard ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.39-2.02; P=.78) over 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptive mobile app intervention, which focused on promoting self-monitoring and self-management, improved the MLHFQ at 6 weeks but did not sustain its effects at 12 weeks. No effect was seen on HF self-management measured by self-report. Further research is needed to enhance engagement in the app for a longer period and to determine if the app can reduce HF readmissions in a larger study.

AB  - Background: Type 1 diabetes involves a multiple decision making process on a daily basis.Mobile technology has been widely spread not only as a mean of communication, but also as multi-usage tool involving a large variety of applications, making everyday life more convenient. “D-Partner” (Diabetes Innovations Ltd) is a mobile based application that serves as a self-management tool for type 1 diabetes, including a bolus wizard (with food database),a basal insulin titration manager, as well as, a large number of automated notifications, warnings or reward messages, according to the data imported by the patient. In addition,“D-Partner” serves as a telemedicine tool, as information of meals, insulin dosage, measurements of glucose, blood pressure, body weight, and lab values, may be monitored by the physician through an on-line, web-based platform.  Aim: To investigate the efficacy of "D-Partner" mobile application, in glucose management, in patients with type 1 diabetes.  Methods: 24 patients with type 1 diabetes (14 male, 10 female), with diabetes duration of 14,2±8,8 years, mean age of 37.4±11,7 years and HBA1c >7%, on basal bolus insulin therapy, were randomized to receive either standard care, or standard care plus the ‘D-Partner” application usage. HBA1c, somatometric data, blood pressure, heart rate and hypoglycemia frequency data, were obtained at baseline and 3 months after the intervention.  Results: The intervention group presented a significantly improved glucose control as recorded by HBA1c reduction, compared to the control group (p=0.01). Additionally, hypoglycemia incidence was significantly lower in the intervention group (p=0.04). There were no significant changes in somatometric data blood pressure, and heart rate, among the 2 groups.  Concusion: D-partner, is a mobile based self-management application, that may contribute to a better management of type 1 diabetes, potentially improving the life quality of the patient.

AB  - Interventions have modest impact on reducing excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women with overweight/obesity. This two‐arm feasibility randomized control trial tested delivery of and compliance with an intervention using adapted dosages to regulate GWG, and examined pre‐post change in GWG and secondary outcomes (physical activity: PA, energy intake: EI, theories of planned behavior/self‐regulation constructs) compared to a usual care group. Pregnant women with overweight/obesity (N = 31) were randomized to a usual care control group or usual care + intervention group from 8 to 2 weeks gestation and completed the intervention through 36 weeks gestation. Intervention women received weekly evidence‐based education/counseling (e.g., GWG, PA, EI) delivered by a registered dietitian in a 60‐min face‐to‐face session. GWG was monitored weekly; women within weight goals continued with education while women exceeding goals received more intensive dosages (e.g., additional hands‐on EI/PA sessions). All participants used mHealth tools to complete daily measures of weight (Wi‐Fi scale) and PA (activity monitor), weekly evaluation of diet quality (MyFitnessPal app), and weekly/monthly online surveys of motivational determinants/self‐regulation. Daily EI was estimated with a validated back‐calculation method as a function of maternal weight, PA, and resting metabolic rate. Sixty‐five percent of eligible women were randomized; study completion was 87%; 10% partially completed the study and drop‐out was 3%. Compliance with using the mHealth tools for intensive data collection ranged from 77 to 97%; intervention women attended > 90% education/counseling sessions, and 68‐93% dosage step‐up sessions. The intervention group (6.9 kg) had 21% lower GWG than controls (8.8 kg) although this difference was not significant. Exploratory analyses also showed the intervention group had significantly lower EI kcals at post‐intervention than controls. A theoretical, adaptive intervention with varied dosages to regulate GWG is feasible to deliver to pregnant women with overweight/obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of an increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and more people having access to smartphones creates opportunities for patient care. This study aims to investigate whether the use of the Diabetes Under Control (DBEES) mobile phone application, a digital diabetes diary, results in a change in quality of life for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) compared with the standard paper diary. METHODS: In this randomized controlled open‐label trial, 63 patients with T1DM having access to a smartphone were assigned to the intervention group using the DBEES application (n = 31) or the control group using the standard paper diary (n = 32). Primary outcome was the change in quality of life, as measured by the RAND‐36 questionnaire, between both groups. Secondary outcomes included diabetes‐related distress (PAID), HbA1c, frequency of self‐monitoring blood glucose, and the usability of the diabetes application (SUS). RESULTS: Patients had a median age (IQR) of 33 (21) years, diabetes duration of 17 (16) years, and an HbA1c of 62 ± 16 mmol/mol. No significant differences in the QOL, using the RAND‐36, within and between both groups were observed after 3 months. Glycemic control, diabetes‐related emotional distress, and frequency of self‐monitoring of blood glucose remained within and between groups. Users reviewed the usability of DBEES with a 72 ± 20, on a range of 0‐100. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the DBEES application in the management of patients with T1DM for 3 months yields no alterations in quality of life compared to the standard paper diary.

AB  - Background
Dietary self-monitoring (DSM) of foods and beverages is associated with weight loss in behavioral interventions; however, DSM may be burdensome, and adherence may decrease over time. Novel methods of DSM, including apps that track food using photographs, may decrease burden, increase DSM adherence, and improve weight loss.

Objective
The objective was to test a mobile photo DSM app compared to a calorie-tracking DSM app on tracking frequency and weight loss in a remotely delivered behavioral weight-loss intervention.

Design
This was a 6-month (October 2016 to April 2017) randomized trial.

Participants/setting
Participants were adults (n=41) classified as overweight or obese (body mass index 25 to 49.9) from South Carolina.

Intervention
Participants received remotely delivered twice-weekly behavioral weight-loss podcasts and tracked diet using a calorie-tracking DSM app (Calorie Group) or a photo DSM app (Photo Group).

Main outcome measures
Main outcomes were the number of days diet was tracked, podcasts downloaded, and weight change at 6 weeks and 6 months.

Statistical analyses
Researchers used nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests and χ2 analysis to test for differences between groups at baseline; repeated-measures models to estimate weight change and Spearman correlations to determine relationships between DSM frequency, podcasts downloaded, and weight change at 6 months.

Results
There were no differences between groups for the number of days that diet was recorded (P=0.18), which was low overall (<30% of days) but was statistically significantly and strongly correlated with weight change for all participants pooled (r=0.63; P<0.001) and for the calorie tracking group (r=0.70; P=0.004), but not the photo tracking group (r=0.51; P=0.06). Participants in both groups had significant weight loss at 6 months (Photo Group, –2.5±0.9 kg; P=0.008; Calorie Group –2.4±0.9 kg; P=0.007), with no differences between groups at either 6 weeks (P=0.66) or at 6 months (P=0.74).

Conclusions
As part of a remotely delivered weight loss intervention, frequency of DSM was significantly associated with overall weight loss for participants using a calorie DSM app but not a photo DSM app. DSM was low regardless of group and weight loss was significant, although minimal. Increasing user engagement with any DSM may be important to increase self-monitoring and improve weight loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) emerges worldwide and is closely associated with short- and long-term health issues in women and their offspring, such as pregnancy and birth complications respectively comorbidities, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), metabolic syndrome as well as cardiovascular diseases. Against this background, mobile health applications (mHealth-Apps) do open up new possibilities to improve the management of GDM. Therefore, we analyzed the clinical effectiveness of specific mHealth-Apps on clinical health-related short and long-term outcomes in mother and child. METHODS: A systematic literature search in Medline (PubMed), Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science Core Collection databases as well as Google Scholar was performed. We selected studies published 2008 to 2020 analyzing women diagnosed with GDM using specific mHealth-Apps. Controlled clinical trials (CCT) and randomized controlled trials (RCT) were included. Study quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) tool. RESULTS: In total, n = 6 publications (n = 5 RCTs, n = 1 CCT; and n = 4 moderate, n = 2 weak quality), analyzing n = 408 GDM patients in the intervention and n = 405 in the control groups, were included. Compared to control groups, fasting blood glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, off target blood glucose measurements, delivery mode (more vaginal deliveries and fewer (emergency) caesarean sections) and patient compliance showed improving trends. CONCLUSION: mHealth-Apps might improve health-related outcomes, particularly glycemic control, in the management of GDM. Further studies need to be done in more detail.

AB  - Mindfulness training, which involves observing thoughts and feelings without judgment or reaction, has been shown to improve aspects of psychosocial well-being when delivered via in-person training programs such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Less is known about the efficacy of digital training mediums, such as smartphone apps, which are rapidly rising in popularity. In this study, novice meditators were randomly allocated to an introductory mindfulness meditation program or to a psychoeducational audiobook control featuring an introduction to the concepts of mindfulness and meditation. The interventions were delivered via the same mindfulness app, were matched across a range of criteria, and were presented to participants as well-being programs. Affect, irritability, and two distinct components of stress were measured immediately before and after each intervention in a cohort of healthy adults. While both interventions were effective at reducing stress associated with personal vulnerability, only the mindfulness intervention had a significant positive impact on irritability, affect, and stress resulting from external pressure (between group Cohen's d = 0.44, 0.47, 0.45, respectively). These results suggest that brief mindfulness training has a beneficial impact on several aspects of psychosocial well-being, and that smartphone apps are an effective delivery medium for mindfulness training.

AB  - Introduction: Appealing approaches to increasing physical activity levels are needed. This study evaluated whether a social and gamified smartphone app (Active Team) could be one such approach. Study design: A 3‐group cluster RCT compared the efficacy of Active Team with a basic self‐monitoring app and waitlist control group. Setting/participants: Australian adults (N=444, mean age of 41 years, 74% female) were recruited in teams (n=121) and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to the Active Team (n=141, 39 teams), self‐monitoring app (n=160, 42 teams), or waitlist group (n=143, 40 teams). Data were collected in 2016â€“2017, and analysis was conducted in 2018â€“2019. Intervention: Active Team is a 100‐day app‐based, gamified, online social networking physical activity intervention. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was change in objective physical activity from baseline to 3‐month follow‐up. Secondary outcomes included objective physical activity at 9 months and self‐reported physical activity, quality of life, depression, anxiety and stress, well‐being, and engagement. Results: Mixed models indicated no significant differences in objective physical activity between groups at 3 (F=0.17, p=0.84; Cohen's d=0.03, 95% CI= âˆ’0.21, 0.26) or 9 months (F=0.23, p=0.92; d=0.06, 95% CI= âˆ’0.17, 0.29) and no significant differences for secondary outcomes of quality of life, depression, anxiety and stress, or well‐being. Self‐reported moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity was significantly higher in the Active Team group at the 9‐month follow‐up (F=3.05, p=0.02; d=0.50, 95% CI=0.26, 0.73). Engagement was high; the Active Team group logged steps on an average of 72 (SD=35) days and used the social and gamified features an average of 89 (SD=118) times. Conclusions: A gamified, online social networking physical activity intervention did not change objective moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity, though it did increase self‐reported moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity and achieve high levels of engagement. Future work is needed to understand if gamification, online social networks, and app‐based approaches can be leveraged to achieve positive behavior change. Trial registration: This study is registered at Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (protocol: ANZCTR12617000113358).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to invest the effect of communal exercise with ' Parkinson home exercise’ application on gait ability. Twenty nine subjects were randomly divided into three groups; CSG (Communal Exercise with Smart app Group), ISG (Individual Communal Exercise with Smart app Group) and CG (Control Group). The subjects were instructed to carry out 10 weeks exercise program. Values were measured before and after the exercise program and the differences were analyzed by two‐way repeated measures ANOVA and Scheffe post‐hoc test (P<.05). In the present result, ambulation time and single leg support (%) were significantly increased among groups; CSG was the most significant among groups (P<.001). Double leg support (%) and distance time were significantly difference among time (P<.001). These findings indicate that communal exercise with smart app. can be effective in gait ability for PD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The well‐being of breast cancer patients and reporting of adverse events require close monitoring. Mobile apps allow continuous recording of disease‐ and medication‐related symptoms in patients undergoing chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of a mobile app on patient‐reported daily functional activity in a supervised and unsupervised setting. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled study of 139 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Patient status was self‐measured using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group, an unsupervised group that used a mobile app to record data, or a supervised group that used the app and reviewed data with a physician. Primary outcome variables were change in daily functional activity and symptoms over three outpatient visits. RESULTS: Functional activity scores declined in all groups from the first to second visit. However, from the second to third visit, only the supervised group improved, whereas the others continued to decline. Overall, the supervised group showed no significant difference from the first (median 90.85, IQR 30.67) to third visit (median 84.76, IQR 18.29, P=.72). Both app‐using groups reported more distinct adverse events in the app than in the questionnaire (supervised: n=1033 vs n=656; unsupervised: n=852 vs n=823), although the unsupervised group reported more symptoms overall (n=4808) in the app than the supervised group (n=4463). CONCLUSIONS: The mobile app was associated with stabilized daily functional activity when used under collaborative review. App‐using participants could more frequently report adverse events, and those under supervision made fewer and more precise entries than unsupervised participants. Our findings suggest that patient well‐being and awareness of chemotherapy adverse effects can be improved by using a mobile app in collaboration with the treating physician.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Addressing overweight and obesity among men at‐risk for obesity‐related diseases and disability in rural communities is a public health issue. Commercial smartphone applications (apps) that promote self‐monitoring for weight loss are widely available. Evidence is lacking regarding what support is required to enhance user engagement with and effectiveness of those technologies. Pragmatically comparing these apps effectiveness, including rural men's desired forms of support when using them, can lead to greater weight loss intervention impact and reach. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile technology application applied differently across two groups for weight loss. METHODS: In a two‐armed, pragmatic pilot feasibility study, 80 overweight and obese men aged 40‐69 were randomized using a 1:1 ratio to either an enhanced Mobile Technology Plus (MT+) intervention or a basic Mobile Technology (MT) intervention. The MT+ group had an enhanced smartphone app for self‐monitoring (text messaging, discussion group, Wi‐Fi scale) whereas the MT group received a basic app that allowed self‐monitoring logging only. Assessments were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months. App logs were analyzed to track engagement and adherence to self‐monitoring. Acceptability was assessed via focus groups. Analysis included descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 men recruited, forty were allocated to each arm. All were included in the primary analysis. Recruitment ended after 10 months with a 97.5 and 92.5% (3 month, 6 month) retention rate. Over 90% of men reported via survey and focus groups that Lose‐It app and smart scale (MT+) was an acceptable way to self‐monitor weight, dietary intake and physical activity. Adherence to daily app self‐monitoring of at least 800 dietary calories or more (reported respectively as MT+, MT) was positive with 73.4, 51.6% tracking at least 5 days a week. Adherence to tracking activity via recorded steps four or more days weekly was positive, 87.8, 64.6%. Men also adhered to self‐weighing at least once weekly, 64, 46.3%. At 6 months, an observed mean weight loss was 7.03 kg (95% CI: 3.67, 10.39) for MT+ group and 4.14 kg (95% CI: 2.22, 6.06) for MT group, with 42.9 and 34.2% meeting ≥5% weight loss, respectively. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This National Institutes of Health‐funded pilot study using mobile technologies to support behavior change for weight loss was found to be feasible and acceptable among midlife and older rural men. The interventions demonstrated successful reductions in weight, noting differing adherence to lifestyle behaviors of eating, monitoring and activity between groups, with men in the MT+ having more favorable results. These findings will be used to inform the design of a larger scale, clinical trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was prospectively registered with ClinicalTrials NCT03329079 . 11/1/2017.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the general public, there appears to be a growing need and interest in receiving digital mental health and well-being support. In response to this, mental health apps (MHapps) are becoming available for monitoring, managing, and promoting positive mental health and well-being. Thus far, evidence supports favorable outcomes when users engage with MHapps, yet there is a relative paucity of reviews on apps that support positive mental health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review the available research on MHapps that promote emotion regulation, positive mental health, and well-being in the general population aged 18-45 years. More specifically, the review aimed at providing a systematic description of the theoretical background and features of MHapps while evaluating any potential effectiveness. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of key databases, including MEDLINE (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Ovid), PsycINFO (via Ovid), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), was performed until January 2021. Studies were included if they described standalone mental health and well-being apps for adults without a formal mental health diagnosis. The quality of all studies was assessed against the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. In addition, the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool (RoB-2) was used to assess randomized control trials (RCTs). Data were extracted using a modified extraction form from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews. A narrative synthesis and meta-analysis were then undertaken to address the review aims. RESULTS: In total, 3156 abstracts were identified. Of these, 52 publications describing 48 MHapps met the inclusion criteria. Together, the studies evaluated interventions across 15 countries. Thirty-nine RCTs were identified suggesting some support for the role of individual MHapps in improving and promoting mental health and well-being. Regarding the pooled effect, MHapps, when compared to controls, showed a small effect for reducing mental health symptoms (k=19, Hedges g=-0.24, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.14; P<.001) and improving well-being (k=13, g=0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.29, P=.004), and a medium effect for emotion regulation (k=6, g=0.49, 95% CI 0.23-0.74, P<.001). There is also a wide knowledge base of creative and innovative ways to engage users in techniques such as mood monitoring and guided exercises. Studies were generally assessed to contribute unclear or a high risk of bias, or to be of medium to low methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging evidence for MHapps that promote positive mental health and well-being suggests promising outcomes. Despite a wide range of MHapps, few apps specifically promote emotion regulation. However, our findings may position emotion regulation as an important mechanism for inclusion in future MHapps. A fair proportion of the included studies were pilot or feasibility trials (k=17, 33%), and full-scale RCTs reported high attrition rates and nondiverse samples. Given the number and pace at which MHapps are being released, further robust research is warranted to inform the development and testing of evidence-based programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Active transportation (AT; ie, walking and cycling as a mode for transportation) has been associated with decreased morbidity and mortality; however, low‐cost and scalable intervention programs are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the research was to determine the effectiveness of a 3‐month behavior change program delivered via a mobile phone app to promote AT (TravelVu Plus) on time spent in moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA). METHODS: For this 2‐arm parallel randomized controlled trial, we recruited a population‐based sample of 254 adults from Stockholm County who were aged 20 to 65 years and had access to a smartphone. On completion of 1‐week baseline measures, the 254 participants were randomized to either the control or intervention group (1:1 ratio). Both groups had access to the standard TravelVu app (Trivector AB) for monitoring their AT for 6 months. The intervention group also received a 3‐month behavior change program to promote AT (TravelVu Plus app). Assessors of outcomes were blinded to group allocation. Outcomes were objectively measured MVPA at 3 (primary) and 6 months. Secondary outcomes were AT, attitudes toward AT, and health‐related quality of life at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: No effect on MVPA was observed after 3 months (P=.29); however, at 6 months the intervention group had a greater improvement in MVPA than the controls (6.05 minutes per day [95% CI 0.36 to 11.74; P=.04]). A Bayesian analyses showed that there was a 98% probability that the intervention had any effect at 6 months, and a 63% probability that this effect was >5 minute MVPA per day. CONCLUSIONS: No effect on MVPA immediately after the intervention period (at 3 months) was observed; however, there was a delayed effect on MVPA (6 minutes per day) at 6 months, which corresponds to approximately 30% of the weekly MVPA recommendation. Our findings suggest that a behavior change program promoting AT delivered via an app may have a relevant effect on PA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phone apps are increasingly used to deliver health interventions, which provide the opportunity to present health information via different communication modes. However, scientific evidence regarding the effects of such health apps is scarce. OBJECTIVE: In a randomized controlled trial, we tested the efficacy of a 6‐month intervention delivered via a mobile phone app that communicated either textual or auditory tailored health information aimed at stimulating fruit and vegetable intake. A control condition in which no health information was given was added. Perceived own health and health literacy were included as moderators to assess for which groups the interventions could possibly lead to health behavior change. METHODS: After downloading the mobile phone app, respondents were exposed monthly to either text‐based or audio‐based tailored health information and feedback over a period of 6 months via the mobile phone app. In addition, respondents in the control condition only completed the baseline and posttest measures. Within a community sample (online recruitment), self‐reported fruit and vegetable intake at 6‐month follow‐up was our primary outcome measure. RESULTS: In total, 146 respondents (ranging from 40 to 58 per condition) completed the study (attrition rate 55%). A significant main effect of condition was found on fruit intake (P=.049, partial η(2)=0.04). A higher fruit intake was found after exposure to the auditory information, especially in recipients with a poor perceived own health (P=.003, partial η(2)=0.08). In addition, health literacy moderated the effect of condition on vegetable intake 6 months later (P<.001, partial η(2)=.11). A higher vegetable intake was found for recipients with high health literacy after exposure to the textual or auditory intervention compared to the control condition (contrasts P=.07 and P=.004, respectively). In the case of relatively low health literacy, vegetable intake was the highest in the control condition (contrasts text control: P=.03; audio control: P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence‐based insight into the effects of a mobile health app. The app seems to have the potential to change fruit and vegetable intake up to 6 months later, at least for specific groups. We found different effects for fruit and vegetable intake, respectively, suggesting that different underlying psychological mechanisms are associated with these specific behaviors. Based on our results, it seems worthwhile to investigate additional ways to increase fruit and vegetable intake in recipients with low health literacy.

AB  - Objective: To investigate effects of cognitive rehabilitation with mobile technology and social support on veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants: There were 112 dyads, comprised by a veteran and a family member or friend (224 participants in total). Design: Dyads were randomized to the following: (1) a novel intervention, Cognitive Applications for Life Management (CALM), involving goal management training plus mobile devices for cueing and training attentional control; or (2) Brain Health Training, involving psychoeducation plus mobile devices to train visual memory. Main Measures: Executive dysfunction (disinhibition, impulsivity) and emotional dysregulation (anger, maladaptive interpersonal behaviors) collected prior to randomization and following intervention completion at 6 months. Results: The clinical trial yielded negative findings regarding executive dysfunction but positive findings on measures of emotion dysregulation. Veterans randomized to CALM reported a 25% decrease in anger over 6 months compared with 8% reduction in the control (B =‐5.27, P =.008). Family/friends reported that veterans randomized to CALM engaged in 26% fewer maladaptive interpersonal behaviors (eg, aggression) over 6 months compared with 6% reduction in the control (B =‐2.08, P =.016). An unanticipated result was clinically meaningful change in reduced PTSD symptoms among veterans randomized to CALM (P <.001). Conclusion: This preliminary study demonstrated effectiveness of CALM for reducing emotional dysregulation in veterans with TBI and PTSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes prevalence has become a global crisis. Due to the substantial rise in smartphone use, a variety of mobile interventions have been developed to help improve the clinical outcomes of diabetes patients. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to examine specific behavior change theories and techniques used in the design of self-management mobile app-based interventions aimed at achieving glycemic control in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A meta-analysis of randomized control trials published in PubMed/Medline and Web of Science between January 2010 and October 2020 was conducted using studies that included diabetes patients, reported on well-described mobile app-based interventions, compared mHealth to usual care, and evaluated glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: We reported on 21 studies with a total of 1,920 diabetes patients. Our findings show that mHealth apps led to statistically significant clinical outcomes as compared to standard care for glycemic control (-0.38, 95% CI=-0.50 to -0.25, p < 0.0001) indicating that such interventions result in a reduction in HbA1c. Interventions that used behavior theory for developing mHealth apps were not statistically different from those that did not (p= 0.18). However, increased use of behavior change techniques (BCTs) may result in slightly higher HbA1c reduction. Among all BCTs, the most effective ones appear to be "Action planning" and "Self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The current meta-analysis provides evidence that mHealth is likely to be beneficial for diabetes patients when the right behavior change techniques are applied to realize the full advantage of the intervention. Further investigation of the role of theory in the design of mHealth app-based interventions is warranted.

AB  - Background: Declining physical activity commonly occurs in people with Parkinson disease (PD) and contributes to reduced functional capacity and quality of life. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the preliminary effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a mobile health (mHealth)‐mediated exercise program designed to promote sustained physical activity in people with PD. Design: This was a 12‐month single‐blind (assessor), pilot, comparative‐effectiveness, randomized controlled study. Methods: An mHealth‐mediated exercise program (walking with a pedometer plus engagement in planned exercise supported by a mobile health application) was compared over 1 year with an active control condition (walking with a pedometer and exercise only). There were 51 participants in a community setting with mild‐to‐moderately severe (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1‐3) idiopathic PD. Daily steps and moderate‐intensity minutes were measured using a step activity monitor for 1 week at baseline and again at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included the 6‐Minute Walk Test, Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 mobility domain, safety, acceptability, and adherence. Results: Both groups increased daily steps, moderate‐intensity minutes, and 6‐Minute Walk Test, with no statistically significant between‐group differences observed. In the less active subgroup, changes in daily steps and moderate‐intensity minutes were clinically meaningful. An improvement in the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 39 mobility score favored mHealth in the overall comparison and was statistically and clinically meaningful in the less active subgroup. Limitations: The limitation of the current study was the small sample size. Conclusions: Both groups improved physical activity compared with expected activity decline over 1 year. The addition of the mHealth app to the exercise intervention appeared to differentially benefit the more sedentary participants. Further study in a larger group of people with low activity at baseline is needed.

AB  - DESIGN: A systematic review. Data Sources. 114 studies were gathered using the following search descriptors: ("mobile phone" OR "smartphone" OR "cell phone" OR "mobile device" OR "mobile apps" OR "mHealth") AND ("exercise" OR "physical activity" OR "physical fitness" OR "motor activity") AND ("physiological outcomes" OR "weight outcomes" OR "psychological outcomes" OR "health" OR "health behavior"). Seven databases were used including databases such as Academic Search Premier and PubMed. PRISMA guidelines were followed in this review. Eligibility Criteria for Selecting Studies. The 20 articles included in this review met the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized and controlled trials, (2) involving an outcome variable measured by accelerometer, and (3) intervention enforced by a smartphone application. RESULTS: Overall, 56% of the studies reviewed in this paper resulted in successful interventions. Of the 19 articles that examined the first individual health outcome of physical and physiological outcomes, 11 interventions resulted in a positive effect on one of the following parameters: MVPA/step count, sedentary behavior, cardiorespiratory fitness, and blood pressure. Six interventions examined the effects on the second individual health outcome, weight-related outcomes. Five of these interventions observed significant positive effects from mobile application interventions on weight and waist circumference. Six articles evaluated the effectiveness of smartphone-based physical activity interventions on the third and final individual health outcome, psychological outcomes, with four resulting in significant positive outcomes in self-efficacy, life enjoyment/satisfaction, and intrinsic PA motivation. CONCLUSION: The findings in this review suggest that mobile application physical activity interventions, compared to unguided exercise activities, can effectively improve certain health outcomes for individuals such as physical/physiological and weight-related outcomes. It was found that research in the area of effectiveness of mobile application interventions on specific psychosocial health outcomes such as self-efficacy, life enjoyment, and intrinsic PA motivation is limited. Thus, the effect of mobile health applications remains unclear for psychosocial outcomes. Due to this limitation, more research is warranted to confirm the findings of this review.

AB  - Testing feasibility and efficacy of psychological treatment via mobile devices is important, given its potential benefits for high-dosage treatment delivery, widespread and inexpensive dissemination, and efficient research methods. We conducted the first randomized controlled trial of attention bias modification training delivered via smartphones, comparing this training to control training in a double-blind design, also including a waitlist condition. All participants performed a variant of dot-probe training involving faces with neutral and disgust (representative of social threat) expressions in brief sessions three times daily over 4 weeks on their own smartphones, at home or anywhere they chose. Attention bias modification, also known as cognitive bias modification of attention, training included a contingency to induce attentional deployment away from disgust faces, whereas the control training included no contingency. Participants completed weekly Internet-based self-report symptom assessments as well as smartphone-delivered dot-probe attention bias assessments, whose reliability findings supported the viability of using smartphones for reaction-time based assessments. The between-groups training effect on attention bias scores was small, showing statistical significance in some analyses and not in others. On measures of social anxiety, intention-to-treat analyses (n = 326) revealed significant pre-post treatment declines with medium to large effect sizes in both training groups, whereas small declines in a waitlist group were nonsignificant. Both training groups showed greater reductions in social anxiety than did waitlist; however, the benefits under these two training conditions were statistically indistinguishable. Improvements in the two training conditions beyond those of waitlist could be attributable to any factors common to them, but not to the contingency training specific to active attention bias modification training.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To conduct systematic review and meta-analysis of interventional studies to investigate the impact of diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) apps on adherence in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). METHODS: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, Scopus and ProQuest were searched, in addition to references of identified articles and similar reviews. Experimental studies, reported in English, assessing DSMES app intervention's impact on adherence and clinical outcomes of patients with T2D compared with usual care were included. Study bias was assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias V.2.0 tool. Analysis plan involved narrative synthesis, moderator and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Six randomised controlled trials were included, involving 696 participants (average age 57.6 years, SD 10.59). Mobile apps were mostly used for imputing clinical data, dietary intake or physical activity, and transmitting information to the provider. At 3 months, DSMES apps proved effective in improving medication adherence (standardized mean difference (SMD)=0.393, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.61), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (mean difference (MD)=-0.314, 95% CI -0.477 to -0.151) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (MD=-0.28, 95% CI -0.545 to -0.015). All pooled estimates had low heterogeneity (I2 0%). Four studies had moderate risk of bias while one each was judged to be low and high risks, respectively. CONCLUSION: DSMES apps had significant small to moderate effects on medication adherence, HbA1c and BMI of patients with T2D compared with usual care. Apps were described as reliable, easy to use and convenient, though participants were required to be phone literate. Evidence comes from feasibility trials with generally moderate risk of bias. Larger trials with longer follow-up periods using theory-based interventions are required to improve current evidence.

AB  - Introduction: The online social networking addiction is a type of technology addiction that can lead to distraction, depression, anxiety, and lower academic performance. In this research, an android mobile application was designed based on the previous literature as well as authors' previous works to measure and decrease social networking addiction level. Methods: This research is a randomized controlled trial. Participants were the students in Urmia University of Technology. The mobile application was designed and sent to 100 (35 males and 65 females) students randomly as an intervention group and was sent to 100 (38 males and 62 females) students randomly as a control group. In order to evaluate the efficacy of treatment, data were collected before and after 2‐week treatment. Results: The results indicated that the designed mobile application can measure the online social networking addiction level with online social networking addiction scale, it can also decrease the online social networking addiction, depression, anxiety level, and the time spent on online social networks, and it can improve the sleep quality and life satisfaction level. Discussion: Therefore, the designed mobile application can be used as an appropriate instrument to measure and decrease the online social networking addiction level of college students.

AB  - AIMS: To test whether the Stop-tabac smartphone application (app) increased smoking cessation rates. DESIGN: A two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 5293 daily smokers (Stop-tabac = 2639, control = 2654) enrolled on app stores and on the internet in 2019-20, who lived in France or Switzerland. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The Stop-tabac application includes immediate feedback during episodes of craving and withdrawal; individually tailored counseling messages with notifications sent during 6 months; a discussion forum; fact sheets; modules on nicotine replacement therapy and e-cigarettes; and calculators of cigarettes not smoked, money saved and days of life gained since quitting. The control application included five brief pages and calculators as above. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcome: self-reported smoking cessation after 6 months (no puff of tobacco in the past 4 weeks), with non-responders counted as smokers. Secondary outcome: self-reported use of nicotine medications. FINDINGS: Participants were aged 36 years on average; 66% were women who smoked 15 cigarettes/day, and 64% screened positive for depression. Stop-tabac participants used the app over a longer period than control participants (23 versus 11 days, P < 0.001). Smoking cessation rates after 6 months were 9.9% in the Stop-tabac group versus 10.3% in the control group (odds ratio = 0.96, 95% confidence interval = 0.80-1.45, P = 0.63). Rates of use of nicotine medications after entry in the study were 38 versus 30% after 6 months (chi<sup>2</sup> = 8.3, P = 0.004) in the Stop-tabac and control groups. After 6 months, 26% of participants in the Stop-tabac group and 8% in the control group said that the app helped them 'a lot' or 'enormously' to quit smoking (chi<sup>2</sup> = 113, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In smokers enrolled on the app stores and the internet, allocation to the Stop-tabac smoking cessation app did not increase smoking cessation rates, but increased rates of use of nicotine medications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technological advancements make it possible to deliver depression interventions via smartphone applications ("Apps"), including those that deliver content "just‐in‐time" (e.g., in response to acute negative mood states). This study examined whether an app‐based just‐in‐time intervention (ImproveYourMood+) decreased depressive symptoms, and whether the following features were related to symptom improvement: micro‐intervention content, mood monitoring, and just‐in‐time prompts to use content. METHODS: Participants (n = 235) from the general population who self‐identified as wanting to improve their negative mood were randomised to a waitlist control group (n = 55) or one of three intervention groups: MoodTracker (monitoring‐only, n = 58), ImproveYourMood (monitoring and content; n = 62), or ImproveYourMood+ (monitoring, content, and prompts; n = 60). The active intervention phase was 3 weeks. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, and negative automatic thoughts were assessed at baseline, immediately post‐intervention, and one month following post‐intervention. RESULTS: Linear mixed modelling revealed greater declines over time in depressive and anxiety symptoms and negative automatic thoughts for the ImproveYourMood group (standardized mean differences [SMDs] ranged from .32 to .40) and improves for the ImproveYourMood+ group for negative automatic thoughts (SMDs ≥ .37) compared to the waitlist control group. No between‐group differences were observed between the MoodTracker and control groups (SMDs = .04‐.23). User experience appeared to be superior in more comprehensive/multi‐modal versions. LIMITATIONS: The study employed a naturalistic design, whereby participants self‐selected to utilise the program, did not complete eligibility assessments, and did not receive compensation. The study therefore attained considerable drop‐out rate (~50% by the follow‐up timepoints), potentially reflecting the usage patterns of real‐world mental health apps. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that micro‐interventions can be an effective way to reduce depressive symptoms both in the moment and 1‐2 months later. Integration of micro‐interventions with full treatment programs is a viable next step in micro‐intervention research.

AB  - Background SaltSwitch is an innovative smartphone application (app) that enables shoppers to scan the barcode of a packaged food and receive an immediate, interpretive, traffic light nutrition label on the screen, along with suggestions for lower salt alternatives. Our aim was to determine the effectiveness of SaltSwitch to support people with cardiovascular disease to make lower salt food choices. Design Six‐week, two‐arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial in Auckland, New Zealand (2 weeks baseline and 4 weeks intervention). Methods Sixty‐six adults with diagnosed cardiovascular disease (mean (SD) age 64 (7) years) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the SaltSwitch smartphone app or control (usual care). The primary outcome was the salt content of household packaged food purchases during the 4‐week intervention (g/MJ). Secondary outcomes were the saturated fat content (g/MJ), energy content (kJ/kg) and expenditure (NZ$) of household food purchases; systolic blood pressure (mmHg), urinary sodium (mg) and use and acceptability of the SaltSwitch app. Results Thirty‐three participants with cardiovascular disease were allocated to the SaltSwitch intervention, and 33 to the control group. A significant reduction in mean household purchases of salt was observed (mean difference (95% confidence interval), ‐0.30 (‐0.58 to ‐0.03) g/MJ), equating to a reduction of ∼0.7 g of salt per person per day during the 4‐week intervention phase. There were no significant between‐group differences in any secondary outcomes (all P > 0.05). Conclusions The SaltSwitch smartphone app is effective in supporting people with cardiovascular disease to make lower salt food purchases. A larger trial with longer follow‐up is warranted to determine the effects on blood pressure.

AB  - Dietary interventions are effective prevention and treatment strategies for chronic diseases; however, they require extensive commitment, time, and resources. Dietary mobile applications (apps) have gained popularity and are thus being incorporated into dietary management. The aim of this review is to assess the effects of the use of dietary mobile apps on nutritional outcomes in adults with chronic diseases. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines using MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO. Intervention studies evaluating the nutritional outcomes of dietary apps, published in English between January 1, 2007 and November 15, 2017 were included. The methodological quality of included articles was assessed via the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics' Quality Criteria Checklist: Primary Research. Heterogeneity was confirmed using the I2 index and a random-effects meta-analysis was performed for randomized controlled trials. Estimates of the pooled mean difference were calculated for app usage compared to no app usage. Nutritional outcomes, categorized as food-/nutrition-related, anthropometric measurements, pertinent clinical/biochemical data, and nutrition-focused physical findings, were extracted from the included intervention studies. Upon completion of the searches, 18,649 articles were identified, and data were extracted from 22 articles. Pooled estimates showed a significantly greater decrease in weight (-2.45 kg, 95% CI -3.33 to -1.58 kg; P<0.001; I2=96.2%, 95% CI 95% to 97%), waist circumference (-2.54 cm, 95% CI -3.34 to -1.73 cm; P<0.001; I2=88.3%, 95% CI 67% to 96%), and energy intake (-149.52 kcal, 95% CI -215.78 to -83.27 kcal; P<0.001; I2=0% CI 0% to 90%) when an app was used compared to control. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that dietary mobile apps are effective self-monitoring tools, and that their use results in positive effects on measured nutritional outcomes in chronic diseases, especially weight loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is known as one of the most important non‐communicable pervasive diseases. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of a mobile‐based educational app on the blood pressure (BP) of patients with hypertension. METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on 66 military personnel who were definitively diagnosed with hypertension by a physician, and then assigned randomly into two groups as intervention (receiving mobile‐based educational app) and control (receiving standard medical management but no app). Before the intervention, BP levels of both groups were measured with a calibrated sphygmomanometer. After 6 weeks, the BPs of both groups were remeasured using the same sphygmomanometer. Thereafter, descriptive and inferential statistics, including paired t‐test, Mann‐Whitney, Chi‐square and Wilcoxon tests, were used. The data obtained were analysed using SPSS‐21 software at a significance level of p<0.05. RESULTS: Comparison of the intervention and control groups showed no statistically significant difference between the groups in systolic BP (p=0.479) and diastolic BP (p=0.851) in the pre‐intervention phase, but after the intervention, systolic and diastolic BP levels were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: The results suggested that the mobile‐based educational app had a significant effect on reducing BP in patients with hypertension. Therefore, using this app is recommended for those military personnel with hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a Mediterranean‐style ketogenic diet mobile health application (app) with breath acetone biofeedback is superior to a calorie‐restricted low‐fat diet app in promoting weight loss. METHODS: Participants (N = 155) with overweight/obesity (mean±SD: 41±11 y, BMI = 34±5 kg/m2 , 71% female) were randomized to one of the interventions that were delivered entirely via app. Participants received a wireless scale and were instructed to take daily weight measurements. A third‐party laboratory collected blood samples at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Weight loss at 12 weeks was greater in the ketogenic (‐5.6 kg; 95% CI, ‐6.7 kg to ‐4.5 kg) compared to the low‐fat group (‐2.5 kg; 95% CI, ‐3.6 kg to ‐1.4 kg) (between‐group difference: ‐3.1 kg; 95% CI, ‐4.6 kg to ‐1.5 kg; p < 0.001). Weight loss at 24 weeks indicated durability of the effect (between‐group difference: ‐5.5 kg; 95% CI, ‐8.3 kg to ‐2.8 kg; p < 0.001). Secondary/exploratory outcomes of HbA1c and liver enzymes were improved to a greater extent in the ketogenic diet group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among adults with overweight/obesity, a ketogenic diet app with breath acetone biofeedback was superior to a calorie‐restricted diet app at promoting weight loss in a real‐world setting.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a web‐based survivorship care plan (SCP) computerized application (APP): (SCP‐A) on women's unmet needs, fear of recurrence, symptom distress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL). Methods: Women diagnosed with breast cancer, who had completed their primary treatment but less than 5 years without a sign of recurrence (N = 165) were randomized to a SCP‐A or a control group. Self‐reported questionnaires were completed by the both groups at baseline (T0), 5 weeks (T1), 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3), and 12 months (T4). Results: Controlling for relevant covariates, mixed effect model analyses revealed a significant decrease in women in the SCP‐A group compared to the control group for total unmet needs since T3 (p < .004) and fear of recurrence since T4 (p = .02). Women in the SCP‐A group also reported significant improvements in QoL at T4 (p < .001) relative to those in the control group. Conclusion: Providing SCP using an information website application for women with breast cancer can decrease unmet needs, fear of recurrence, and improve quality of life during short‐term and long‐term use. Practice Implications: Web‐based information that provides survivorship care plans for breast cancer survivors are beneficial.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a substantial problem, causing early death and great economic burden. Research has highlighted the potential positive impact of technological interventions, such as smartphone applications (app) in treatment of AUD. The aim of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a smartphone app, incorporating computerized cognitive behavioural therapy and text messaging support, on alcohol outcomes over 6 months in a post-rehabilitation setting. METHODS: A total of 111 participants with AUD were recruited into this randomized controlled trial, following completion of a 30-day rehabilitation programme. The intervention group (n = 54) used the smartphone app "UControlDrink" (UCD) over 6 months with treatment as usual (TAU), and the control group (n = 57) received TAU. All subjects suffered from AUD as the primary disorder, with other major psychiatric disorders excluded. All intervention subjects used the UCD smartphone app in the treatment trial, and all subjects underwent TAU consisting of outpatient weekly support groups. Drinking history in the previous 90 days was measured at baseline and at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Additional measurements were made to assess mood, anxiety, craving, and motivation. Results were analysed using intention-to-treat analyses. RESULTS: Retention in the study was 72% at 3 months and 52% at 6 months. There was a significant reduction in heavy drinking days in the intervention group relative to TAU over the 6 months, p < 0.02. CONCLUSIONS: The UCD smartphone app demonstrates a significant benefit to reducing heavy drinking days over a 6-month post-rehabilitation period in AUD.

AB  - Objective The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence regarding the effects of mobile health applications (mHealth apps) for self-management outcomes in patients with asthma and to assess the functionalities of effective interventions. Methods We systematically searched Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included English-language studies that evaluated the effects of smartphone or tablet computer apps on self-management outcomes in asthmatic patients. The characteristics of these studies, effects of interventions, and features of mHealth apps were extracted. Results A total of 10 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Outcomes that were assessed in the included studies were categorized into three groups (clinical, patient-reported, and economic). mHealth apps improved asthma control (five studies) and lung function (two studies) from the clinical outcomes. From the patient-reported outcomes, quality of life (three studies) was statistically significantly improved, while there was no significant impact on self-efficacy scores (two studies). Effects on economic outcomes were equivocal, so that the number of visits (in two studies) and admission and hospitalization-relevant outcomes (in one study) statistically significantly improved; and in four other studies, these outcomes did not improve significantly. mHealth apps features were categorized into seven categories (inform, instruct, record, display, guide, remind/alert, and communicate). Eight of the 10 mHealth apps included more than one functionality. Nearly all interventions had the functionality of recording user-entered data and half of them had the functionality of providing educational information and reminders to patients. Conclusion Multifunctional mHealth apps have good potential in the control of asthma and in improving the quality of life in such patients compared with traditional interventions. Further studies are needed to identify the effectiveness of these interventions on outcomes related to medication adherence and costs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While nonprofessional caregivers often experience a sense of fulfillment when they provide care, there is also a significant risk of emotional and physical burnout. Consequently, this can negatively affect both the caregiver and the person being cared for. Intervention programs can help empower nonprofessional caregivers of people with chronic diseases and develop solutions to decrease the physical and psychological consequences resulting from caregiving. However, most clinically tested intervention programs for nonprofessional caregivers require face‐to‐face training, and many caregivers encounter obstacles that hinder their participation in such programs. Consequently, it is necessary to design internet‐based intervention programs for nonprofessional caregivers that address their needs and test the efficacy of the programs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone app‐based intervention program to increase positive mental health for nonprofessional caregivers. METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 3 months' duration. A total of 152 caregivers over 18 years of age with a minimum of 4 months' experience as nonprofessional caregivers were recruited from primary health care institutions. Nonprofessional caregivers were randomized into two groups. In the intervention group, each caregiver installed a smartphone app and used it for 28 days. This app offered them daily activities that were based on 10 recommendations to promote positive mental health. The level of positive mental health, measured using the Positive Mental Health Questionnaire (PMHQ), and caregiver burden, measured using the 7‐item short‐form version of the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI‐7), were the primary outcomes. Users' satisfaction was also measured. RESULTS: In all, 113 caregivers completed the study. After the first month of the intervention, only one factor of the PMHQ, F1‐Personal satisfaction, showed a significant difference between the groups, but it was not clinically relevant (0.96; P=.03). However, the intervention group obtained a higher mean change for the overall PMHQ score (mean change between groups: 1.40; P=.24). The results after the third month of the intervention showed an increment of PMHQ scores. The mean difference of change in the PMHQ score showed a significant difference between the groups (11.43; P<.001; d=0.82). Significant changes were reported in 5 of the 6 factors, especially F5‐Problem solving and self‐actualization (5.69; P<.001; d=0.71), F2‐Prosocial attitude (2.47; P<.001; d=1.18), and F3‐Self‐control (0.76; P=.03; d=0.50). The results of the ZBI‐7 showed a decrease in caregiver burden in the intervention group, although the results were inconclusive. Approximately 93.9% (46/49) of the app users indicated that they would recommend the app to other caregivers and 56.3% (27/49) agreed that an extension of the program's duration would be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: The app‐based intervention program analyzed in this study was effective in promoting positive mental health and decreasing the burden of caregivers and achieved a high range of user satisfaction. This study provides evidence that mobile phone app‐based intervention programs may be useful tools for increasing nonprofessional caregivers' well‐being. The assessment of the effectiveness of intervention programs through clinical trials should be a focus to promote internet‐based programs in health policies.

AB  - Recent studies demonstrated that the duration of inactivity (sedentary state) is independently associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Our goal was to develop the technology that can measure the amount of inactivity in real time, remind a person that a preprogrammed period of inactivity has occurred and encourage a period of activity, and provide web‐based feedback with tailored information to the participant and investigators. Once it was developed, we carried out a pilot study in a group of sedentary overweight women. The objective of the study was to assess potential of the mobile app to reduce inactivity in our target population. A randomized crossover design was employed with study subjects randomly assigned to a 4‐week each "message‐on" and "message‐off" periods. Out of 30 enrolled subjects, 27 completed the study. The average age of particpants was 52±12; BMI: 37±6; 47% were white and 47% were African American. Overall, inactivity was significantly lower (p<0.02) during "message‐on" periods (24.6%) as compared to the "message‐off" periods (30.4%). We conluded that mobile app monitoring inactivity and providing a real‐time notification when inactivity period exceeds healthy limits was able to significantly reduce inactivity periods in overweight sedentary women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global health emergency generated by the COVID‐19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented challenge to health care workers, who are facing heavy workloads under psychologically difficult situations. Mental mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are now being widely deployed due to their attractive implementation features, despite the lack of evidence about their efficacy in this specific population and context. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational, mindfulness‐based mHealth intervention to reduce mental health problems in health care workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, parallel‐group, controlled trial in Spain. Health care workers providing face‐to‐face health care to patients with COVID‐19 were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (an app targeting emotional skills, healthy lifestyle behavior, burnout, and social support) or a control app (general recommendations about mental health care) for 2 weeks. The participants were blinded to their group allocation. Data were collected telephonically at baseline and after 2 weeks by trained health psychologists. The primary outcome was a composite of depression, anxiety, and stress (overall score on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale‐21 [DASS‐21]). Secondary outcomes were insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey), posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), self‐efficacy (General Self‐Efficacy Scale), and DASS‐21 individual scale scores. Differences between groups were analyzed using general linear modeling according to an intention‐to‐treat protocol. Additionally, we measured the usability of the PsyCovidApp (System Usability Scale). The outcome data collectors and trial statisticians were unaware of the treatment allocation. RESULTS: Between May 14 and July 25, 2020, 482 health care workers were recruited and randomly assigned to PsyCovidApp (n=248) or the control app (n=234). At 2 weeks, complete outcome data were available for 436/482 participants (90.5%). No significant differences were observed between the groups at 2 weeks in the primary outcome (standardized mean difference ‐0.04; 95% CI ‐0.11 to 0.04; P=.15) or in the other outcomes. In our prespecified subgroup analyses, we observed significant improvements among health care workers consuming psychotropic medications (n=79) in the primary outcome (‐0.29; 95% CI ‐0.48 to ‐0.09; P=.004), and in posttraumatic stress, insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Similarly, among health care workers receiving psychotherapy (n=43), we observed improvements in the primary outcome (‐0.25; 95% CI ‐0.49 to ‐0.02; P=.02), and in insomnia, anxiety, and stress. The mean usability score of PsyCovidApp was high (87.21/100, SD 12.65). After the trial, 208/221 participants in the intervention group (94.1%) asked to regain access to PsyCovidApp, indicating high acceptability. CONCLUSIONS: In health care workers assisting patients with COVID‐19 in Spain, PsyCovidApp, compared with a control app, reduced mental health problems at 2 weeks only among health care workers receiving psychotherapy or psychotropic medications.

AB  - AIM: The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention on the wellbeing of Pasifika peoples, and to explore factors associated with Pasifika wellbeing. METHODS: The OL@‐OR@ mHealth programme was a co‐designed smartphone app. Culturally relevant data was collected to examine holistic health and wellbeing status, at baseline, and at 12 weeks (end of the trial). The concept of wellbeing was examined as part of a two‐arm, cluster randomised trial, using only the Pasifika data: 389 (of 726) Pasifika adults were randomised to receive the mHealth intervention, while 405 (of 725) Pasifika adults were randomised to receive a control version of the intervention. Culturally relevant data was collected to examine holistic health and wellbeing status, at baseline, and at 12 weeks (end of the trial). The intervention effects and the association of demographic and behavioural relationships with wellbeing, was examined using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, there were significant differences between the intervention and control groups for the 'family/community' wellbeing, at the end of the 12‐week trial. There were no significant differences observed for all other wellbeing domains for both groups. Based on our multivariate regression analyses, education and acculturation (assimilation and marginalisation) were identified as positively strong factors associated to Pasifika 'family and community' wellbeing. CONCLUSION: Our study provides new insights on how Pasifika peoples' characteristics and behaviours align to wellbeing. Our findings point to 'family and community' as being the most important wellbeing factor for Pasifika peoples.

AB  - The rapid advances and adoption of smartphone technology presents a novel opportunity for delivering mental health interventions on a population scale. Despite multi-sector investment along with wide-scale advertising and availability to the general population, the evidence supporting the use of smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta-analysis of smartphone apps for depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 eligible randomized controlled trials of 22 smartphone apps, with outcome data from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more from smartphone apps than control conditions (g=0.38, 95% CI: 0.24-0.52, p<0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a moderate positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g=0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions (g=0.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.33). Effects from smartphone-only interventions were greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/computerized aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training apps had a significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p=0.004) than those of apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood monitoring softwares, or interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating aspects of mindfulness training, did not affect significantly study effect sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising self-management tool for depression. Future research should aim to distil which aspects of these technologies produce beneficial effects, and for which populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various psychological interventions are effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety when used alone, or as an adjunct to anti-anxiety medications. Recent studies have further indicated that smartphone-supported psychological interventions may also reduce anxiety, although the role of mobile devices in the treatment and management of anxiety disorders has yet to be established. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting the effects of psychological interventions delivered via smartphone on symptoms of anxiety (sub-clinical or diagnosed anxiety disorders). A systematic search of major electronic databases conducted in November 2016 identified 9 eligible RCTs, with 1837 participants. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate the standardized mean difference (as Hedges' g) between smartphone interventions and control conditions. RESULTS: Significantly greater reductions in total anxiety scores were observed from smartphone interventions than control conditions (g=0.325, 95% C.I.=0.17-0.48, p<0.01), with no evidence of publication bias. Effect sizes from smartphone interventions were significantly greater when compared to waitlist/inactive controls (g=0.45, 95% C.I.=0.30-0.61, p<0.01) than active control conditions (g=0.19, 95% C.I.=0.07-0.31, p=0.003). LIMITATIONS: The extent to which smartphone interventions can match (or exceed) the efficacy of recognised treatments for anxiety has yet to established. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that psychological interventions delivered via smartphone devices can reduce anxiety. Future research should aim to develop pragmatic methods for implementing smartphone-based support for people with anxiety, while also comparing the efficacy of these interventions to standard face-to-face psychological care.

AB  - Objective: Roughly 35% of college students report depression as a significant concern, which unaddressed, can lead to an increased likelihood to quit school and develop comorbid conditions. Traditional depression interventions are useful; however, they are often expensive, stigmatizing, tedious, and time-intensive. We examined a prescribed mindfulness meditation regimen, which incorporates gamification principles, in reducing symptoms of depression compared to a control group. Materials and methods: We recruited and randomly assigned 72 college students to an experimental group (n = 33) or a control group (n = 39). The prescription for experimfiental group participants was ten 10-minute mobile mindfulness meditation sessions over a 14-day period; control group participants continued with business as usual. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to test our hypothesis. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant interaction of group by time for depression scores, supporting the hypothesis that experimental group participants would significantly decrease their depression symptom severity compared to control group participants post-intervention. Within-subjects contrasts and between-group analyses showed a significant decrease in depression symptom severity scores. Conclusion: Prescribed use of a gamified mindfulness meditation application significantly decreased depression symptom severity as measured by the PHQ-9. College students and mental health providers should consider these fun, inexpensive, and non-stigmatizing applications as a feasible intervention for college students to improve symptoms associated with depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Web-based cognitive-behavioral therapeutic (CBT) apps have demonstrated efficacy but are characterized by poor adherence. Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS: In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, "Depression in College Students," as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). RESULTS: Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F<sub>1,54</sub>= 9.24; P=.004). Participants ' comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT.

AB  - Objectives: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy causes distressing symptoms, which have to be managed by patients at home. Assessing and acting upon relevant patient‐reported symptoms regularly with the support of mHealth such as apps, has shown to decrease symptom burden and improve health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). There is a lack of apps for patients with breast cancer which are tested in rigorous trials and only a few include interactive components for immediate clinical management. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the use of the interactive app Interaktor improves patientsâ€™ levels of symptom burden and HRQoL during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Materials and methods: This randomized controlled trial included patients in an intervention group (n = 74) and a control group (n = 75), recruited at two university hospitals in Stockholm, Sweden. The intervention group used Interaktor for symptom reporting, self‐care advice and support from health‐care professionals during treatment, and the control group received standard care alone. Self‐reported symptoms and HRQoL were assessed at two time points to determine differences between the groups. Results: The intervention group rated statistically significant less symptom prevalence in nausea, vomiting, feeling sad, appetite loss and constipation. Overall symptom distress and physical symptom distress were rated statistically significant lower in the intervention group. Further, emotional functioning was rated statistically significant higher in the intervention group. Conclusions: By using the Interaktor app in clinical practice, patients get individual support when managing treatment‐related symptoms during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, leading to decreased symptom burden and improved emotional functioning.

AB  - Patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy are often treated as outpatients and experience several distressing symptoms and concerns over a long period, which must be managed at home. Routine use of patient reported outcomes facilitates communication with the healthcare of what needs the patient may have. To support patients with cancer during treatment, the use of mHealth has shown promising results in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life.Aim: To evaluate how an interactive app for reporting and managing symptoms provides supportive care in patients with breast cancer during neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Methods: Through the app patients report symptoms daily as well as write free text messages. The reports are monitored and responded to by a contact nurse at the clinic. Further, the patients have access to self-care advice and can view their reported symptoms in graphs. This randomized controlled trial was conducted according to the Medical Research Council's framework for complex interventions. In Study I, the patients were randomized to an intervention group (n = 74), who used the app during treatment in combination with standard care, and to a control group (n = 75), who received standard care alone. Both groups answered questionnaires regarding symptoms and health-related quality of life before start of treatment and two weeks after end of treatment, to evaluate if the intervention had any effects on the patients' symptoms and health-related quality of life.Study II investigated the patients' engagement in using the app. Logged data from the patient's app usage (n = 74) and predictors of usage were analyzed. Telephone interviews were conducted with the patients about how they perceived using the app during treatment. In Study III, face-to-face interviews were conducted three months after end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with patients from both groups (n = 40) about perceptions of care during treatment with or without using the app.Results: In Study I, patients who used the app during treatment perceived less prevalence of symptoms and symptom distress and better emotional functioning two weeks after end of treatment compared with the patients in the control group. In Study II, the adherence to reporting in the app was 83%. The components included in the app, such as self-care advice and graphs, were used by most of the patients. Higher age predicted fewer free text messages sent. The app was considered easy to use with a relevant content, which facilitated support for symptom management and own monitoring of symptoms as well as having a close, continuous, and interactive contact with the contact nurse. In Study III, results showed that most of the patients, whether they had used the app or not, were satisfied with the care during the treatment. The patients who had used the app perceived it as an added value for support as they were provided easy access to information and communication regarding experienced symptoms with the contact nurse. Moreover, Interaktor facilitated performing self-care by using the self-care advice and promoted own participation in care.Conclusions: This thesis shows that patients with breast cancer can receive supportive care by using an app such as Interaktor during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. By facilitating interaction and communication with the contact nurse, symptoms can be identified and managed in a timely manner as well as enhancing patients' participation in their own care.

AB  - Aims: Cognitive bias modification (CBM) training has been considered a promising and effective
intervention tool for reducing cognitive biases toward alcohol. However, the link between the
cognitive process and actual behavior remains statistically insignificant because computerized
tasks do not have sufficient ecological validity and suffer from high dropout rates. The recent
development of ‘serious games’ has shown encouraging results in maintaining adherence to
health-related interventions. We aim to evaluate a CBM program using a gamified attentional bias
(AB) training procedure on a touchpad for individuals with alcohol use disorders.
Methods: Forty-one patients were included in this study, 33 of whom displayed an AB and were
randomly assigned into the ‘CBM group’ (N = 18, 16.7% women) or ‘Memory group’—which
involved playing a memory game—(N = 15, no woman). Eight other participants (12.5% women)
with no AB comprised the ‘Without AB group’. Efficacy was assessed for AB, craving, and inhibition
and attentional capacities before and after the program.
Results: We observed that the reduction of AB was higher for the ‘CBM group’ (Mbefore = 153.61,
SD = 172.21; Mafter = 18.00, SD = 77.71; t (17) = 4.21, P = 0.001) than for the ‘Memory group’
(Mbefore = 73.20, SD = 66.65; Mafter =42.47, SD = 113.77; ts < 1). The analysis showed that for
the ‘Without AB group’, there was no significant difference in AB (t (7) = −2.15, P = .07) after the
program.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated an increased reduction of AB for patients included in the
CBM program on a touchpad than for patients playing only a memory game.

AB  - We present the results of a pre-registered randomised controlled trial (RCT) that tested whether two smartphone-based mindfulness meditation applications (apps) lead to improvements in mental health. University students (n = 208, aged 18 to 49) were randomly assigned to use one of the three apps: Headspace, Smiling Mind, or Evernote (control group). Participants were instructed to use their assigned app for 10 min each day for 10 days, after which they received an extended 30 days' access to continue practicing at their discretion. Participants completed measures of depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, college adjustment, flourishing, resilience, and mindfulness at baseline, after the 10-day intervention, and after the 30-day continued access period. App usage was measured by self-report. Mindfulness app usage was high during the 10-day period (used on 8 of 10 days), but low during the 30-day extended use period (less than 20% used the app 2+ times per week). Mindfulness app users showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, college adjustment, resilience (Smiling Mind only), and mindfulness (Headspace only) from baseline to the end of 10 days relative to control participants. Participants who continued to use the app frequently were more likely to maintain improvements in mental health, e.g. in depressive symptoms and resilience (Headspace only), until the end of the 30-day period. Thus, brief mobile mindfulness meditation practice can improve some aspects of negative mental health in the short term and may strengthen positive mental health when used regularly. Further research is required to examine the long-term effects of these apps. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective and Design: In a pragmatic, randomised, waitlist‐controlled trial we tracked 250 first‐year university students who were randomly assigned to 3â€‰months of a mindfulness meditation app (Headspace) to use at their discretion in either semester 1 (intervention, nâ€‰=â€‰124) or semester 2 (waitlist, nâ€‰=â€‰126). Main Outcome Measures: Students reported their distress, college adjustment, resilience, self‐efficacy, and mindfulness, at 3 timepoints: the beginning of semester 1, the beginning of semester 2, and the end of the academic year. With participants' permission, the university provided academic achievement data and Headspace provided app use data. Results: Evidence for improvements in distress at the beginning of semester 2 was weak (intervention vs. waitlist) and app use was low (Mâ€‰=â€‰7.91, SD = 15.16 sessions). Nevertheless, intervention participants who used the app more frequently reported improvements in psychological distress (‐5 points, R2 change = .12) and college adjustment (+10 points, R2 change = .09) when compared to non‐users. App initiation and persistence beyond the first week was higher when the app was provided in semester 1 than semester 2 (66.1% vs. 44.4%; 46.0% vs. 32.5%). Conclusion: Headspace use was associated with small improvements in distress and college adjustment in first‐year university students. Intervening at the beginning of the academic year may encourage uptake.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, no meta-analysis to date has assessed the efficacy of mobile phone apps to promote weight loss and increase physical activity. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to compare the efficacy of mobile phone apps compared with other approaches to promote weight loss and increase physical activity. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies identified by a search of PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus from their inception through to August 2015. Two members of the study team (EG-F, GF-M) independently screened studies for inclusion criteria and extracted data. We included all controlled studies that assessed a mobile phone app intervention with weight-related health measures (ie, body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference) or physical activity outcomes. Net change estimates comparing the intervention group with the control group were pooled across studies using random-effects models. RESULTS: We included 12 articles in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, use of a mobile phone app was associated with significant changes in body weight (kg) and body mass index (kg/m(2)) of -1.04 kg (95% CI -1.75 to -0.34; I2 = 41%) and -0.43 kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.74 to -0.13; I2 = 50%), respectively. Moreover, a nonsignificant difference in physical activity was observed between the two groups (standardized mean difference 0.40, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.87; I2 = 93%). These findings were remarkably robust in the sensitivity analysis. No publication bias was shown. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this study shows that mobile phone app-based interventions may be useful tools for weight loss.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The information needs of cancer patients are highly variable. Literature suggests an improved ability to modulate personalised stress, increased patient involvement with decision making, greater satisfaction with treatment choices and reduced anxiety levels in cancer patients who have access to information. The aim of this project was to evaluate the effects of a mobile information application on anxiety levels of patients undergoing surgery for breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An application was developed for use with Apple iPad containing information on basic breast cancer biology, different treatments used and surgical techniques. Content and face validity studies were performed. A randomized control trial was designed, with a 1:2 allocation. Data collected include basic demographics and type of surgery. Questionnaires used included: the HADS, Mini‐MAC, information technology familiarity and information satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 39 women participated. 13 women had access to an iPad containing additional information and 26 women acted as controls. The mean age was 54 and technology familiarity was similar among both groups. Anxiety and depression scores at seven days were significantly lower in control patients without access to the additional information provided by the mobile application (p = 0.022 and 0.029 respectively). CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients is both multifactorial and significant, with anxiety levels directly correlating with reduced quality of life. Intuitively, information should improve anxiety levels, however, we have demonstrated that surgical patients with less information reported significantly lower anxiety. We advise the thorough testing and auditing of information initiatives before deployment.

AB  - PURPOSE: 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of an mHealth application (app), self-management physical activity intervention FOOTFIT with an added patient-provider connectivity feature (FOOTFIT+), that was designed to strengthen the lower extremities of minimally ambulatory individuals with venous leg ulcers (VLUs).

DESIGN: 
Randomized controlled trial.

SUBJECTS AND SETTING: 
Twenty-four adults 18 years and older with VLUs being treated in 2 wound clinics in the Southeastern United States participated in this study.

METHODS: 
Preliminary estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the medians of short-term functional impacts on foot function, strength, ankle range of motion, walking capacity, depression, and physical functioning were obtained pre- and postassessment after the 6-week intervention trial.

RESULTS: 
There were negligible changes in either group for foot function. It is noted that both groups experienced substantial foot and ankle impairment at baseline. The greatest improvement in range of motion was noted in the FOOTFIT group for dorsiflexion of the right ankle (4.6 ± 5.22 lb/in2 over baseline) whereas strength decreased in both ankles for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion in the FOOTFIT+ group. No improvements were noted in walking distance or physical health for FOOTFIT (slight decrease −2.9 ± 5.6) and FOOTFIT+ (slight increase 3.0 ± 6.6) during the 6-week study period.

CONCLUSIONS: 
In a minimally ambulatory population with VLUs, our mHealth FOOTFIT intervention composed of progressive exercise “boosts” demonstrated minimal short-term effects. We recommend engagement with the app for a longer period to determine longer-term outcomes of lower extremity function.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the feasibility of a randomised trial of a modified, pre‐existing, mindfulness meditation smartphone app for women with chronic pelvic pain. Design Three arm randomised feasibility trial. Setting Women were recruited at two gynaecology clinics in the UK. Interventions were delivered via smartphone or computer at a location of participants choosing. Participants Women were eligible for the study if they were over 18, had been experiencing organic or non‐organic chronic pelvic pain for 6 months or more, and had access to a computer or smartphone. 90 women were randomised. Interventions Daily mindfulness meditation delivered by smartphone app, an active control app which delivered muscle relaxation techniques, and usual care without app. Interventions were delivered over 60 days. Primary and secondary outcome measures Outcomes included length of recruitment, follow‐up rates, adherence to the app interventions, and clinical outcomes measured at baseline, two, three and 6 months. Results The target sample size was recruited in 145 days. Adherence to the app interventions was extremely low (mean app use 1.8 days mindfulness meditation group, 7.0 days active control). Fifty‐seven (63%) women completed 6‐month follow‐up, and 75 (83%) women completed at least one postrandomisation follow‐up. The 95% CIs for clinical outcomes were consistent with no benefit from the mindfulness meditation app; for example, mean differences in pain acceptance scores at 60 days (higher scores are better) were ‐2.3 (mindfulness meditation vs usual care, 95% CI: ‐6.6 to 2.0) and ‐4.0 (mindfulness meditation vs active control, 95% CI: ‐8.1 to 0.1). Conclusions Despite high recruitment and adequate follow‐up rates, demonstrating feasibility, the extremely low adherence suggests a definitive randomised trial of the mindfulness meditation app used in this study is not warranted. Future research should focus on improving patient engagement. Trial registration numbers NCT02721108; ISRCTN10925965; Results.

AB  - Individual instances of nonadherence to reduced calorie dietary prescriptions, that is, dietary lapses, represent a key challenge for weight management. Just‐in‐time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), which collect and analyze data in real time to deliver tailored interventions during moments of need, may be well suited to promote weight loss by preventing dietary lapses. We developed OnTrack (OT), a smartphone application (app) that collects data on lapses and triggers of lapse, uses a continuously improving machine learning model to predict lapse risk, and delivers tailored interventions when risk is elevated. The current study evaluated the efficacy of OT against an active control in facilitating weight loss. Participants (N = 181) with overweight/obesity (MBMI = 34.32; 85.1% female; 73.5% White) were randomized to receive either the WW (formerly Weight Watchers) Beyond the Scale (BTS) digital program alone or WW plus OnTrack (WW + OT) for 10 weeks. In an unplanned, natural experiment, the WW program changed mid‐way through the trial from BTS to a more flexible one, Freestyle (FS). A general linear model revealed a treatment condition Ã— diet plan interaction (F[1, 173] = 9.68, p = .002) such that OT demonstrated greater efficacy only among those receiving BTS (weight loss MWW + OT = 4.7%, standard error [SE] = .55 versus MWW = 2.6%, SE = .80). Compared to FS, BTS WW + OT participants also reported considerably higher satisfaction with the intervention, engagement was higher, and algorithm accuracy was superior. Overall, results offer qualified support for OT and generally for machine learning‐powered JITAIs that facilitate weight loss by predicting and preventing dietary lapses.

AB  - TeleDiab‐2 was a 13‐month randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two telemonitoring systems to optimize basal insulin (BI) initiation in subjects with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c, 7.5%‐10%). A total of 191 participants (mean age 58.7 years, mean HbA1c 8.9%) were randomized into three groups: group 1(G1, standard care, n = 63), group 2 (G2, interactive voice response system, n = 64) and group 3 (G3, Diabeo‐BI app software, n = 64). The two telemonitoring systems proposed daily adjustments of BI doses, in order to facilitate the achievement of fasting blood glucose (FBG) values targeted at ~100 mg/dL. At 4 months follow‐up, HbA1c reduction was significantly higher in the telemonitoring groups (G2: âˆ’1.44% and G3: âˆ’1.48% vs. G1: âˆ’0.92%; P < 0.002). Moreover, target FBG was reached by twice as many patients in the telemonitoring groups as in the control group, and insulin doses were also titrated to higher levels. No severe hypoglycaemia was observed in the telemonitoring groups and mild hypoglycaemia frequency was similar in all groups. In conclusion, both telemonitoring systems improved glycaemic control to a similar extent, without increasing hypoglycaemic episodes.

AB  - Background: The DIABEO® system (DS) is a telemedicine solution that combines a mobile app for patients with a web portal for health care providers. DS allows real‐time monitoring of basal‐bolus insulin therapy as well as therapeutic decision‐making, integrating both basal and bolus dose calculation. Real‐life studies have shown a very low rate of use of mobile health applications by patients. Therefore, we conducted a large randomized controlled trial study to investigate the efficacy of DS in conditions close to real life (TELESAGE study). Methods: TELESAGE was a multicenter, randomized, open study with three parallel arms: arm 1 (standard care), arm 2 (DIABEO alone), and arm 3 (DIABEO+telemonitoring by trained nurses). The primary outcome assessed the reduction in HbA1c levels after a 12‐month follow‐up. Results: Six hundred sixty‐five patients were included in the study. Participants who used DIABEO once or more times a day (DIABEO users) showed a significant and meaningful reduction of HbA1c versus standard care after a 12‐month follow‐up: mean difference ‐0.41% for arm 2‐arm 1 (P = 0.001) and ‐0.51% for arm 3‐arm 1 (P ≤ 0.001). DIABEO users included 25.1% of participants in arm 2 and 37.6% in arm 3. In the intention‐to‐treat population, HbA1c changes and incidence of hypoglycemia were comparable between arms. Conclusions: A clinical and statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels was found in those patients who used DIABEO at least once a day.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effectiveness and acceptability of a novel intervention, based on self‐regulation theory, for weight loss. DESIGN: A two‐arm parallel group design was employed. METHODS: Adult participants with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and the aim to lose weight were recruited and randomized to either a control or intervention group. Both groups were asked to weigh themselves daily for eight weeks. The intervention group was encouraged to use a weight tracking app, and complete daily and weekly questionnaires to prompt action planning, reflection, and evaluation of actions. Participants chose daily actions from a menu of 53 behaviours. The primary outcome was weight change after 8 weeks, assessed using linear mixed effects models. At follow‐up, 20 intervention group participants were interviewed regarding their experiences in the trial. RESULTS: 100 participants were recruited, and 98% were followed up at 8 weeks. Mean weight loss was ‐4.18 kg (SD = 3.84) in the intervention compared to ‐1.01 kg (SD = 2.67) in the control group; the adjusted difference was ‐3.20 kg (95% CI ‐4.49, ‐1.92). Participants rated the intervention's usefulness as 8.25 (SD = 2.04) on a scale from 1 to 10. Adherence was a significant independent predictor of weight loss success (‐1.54 kg per one SD, 95% CI ‐2.16, ‐0.93), but not a mediator of the intervention effect. Participants reported that the intervention enabled them to experiment with and identify effective weight loss actions. CONCLUSIONS: Guiding participants through the self‐regulation process was feasible, acceptable to participants, and led to significantly greater short‐term weight loss than unguided self‐weighing.

AB  - Importance: Mobile phone applications (apps) and activity trackers allow researchers to remotely deliver an intervention and monitor physical activity but have not been rigorously evaluated for longer periods. Objective: To determine whether a mobile phone‐based physical activity education app, in conjunction with brief in‐person counseling, increases and then maintains levels of physical activity. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this parallel randomized clinical trial, community‐dwelling physically inactive women recruited between May 2011 and April 2014 were randomized in equal proportions into the control (n = 69), regular (n = 71), and plus (n = 70) groups. Data were analyzed using intention to treat from September 16, 2016, through June 30, 2018. Interventions: The regular and plus groups were instructed to use the app on their mobile phone and an accelerometer every day for 3 months and attend brief in‐person counseling. During the 6‐month maintenance period, the plus group continued to use the app and accelerometer, while the regular group stopped using the app but continued using the accelerometer. The control group used the accelerometer throughout. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary and secondary outcomes were daily accelerometer‐measured total steps and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results: The 210 participants had a mean (SD) age of 52.4 (11.0) years. At baseline, the mean (SD) daily total steps by accelerometer in the control, regular, and plus groups were 5384 (2920), 5063 (2526), and 5837 (3235), respectively. During the 3‐month intervention period, daily steps and MVPA increased in the combined regular and plus groups compared with the control group (between‐group differences, 2060 steps per day; 95% CI, 1296‐2825 steps per day; P < .001 and 18.2 min/d MVPA; 95% CI, 10.9‐25.4 min/d MVPA; P < .001). During the subsequent 6‐month maintenance period, mean activity level remained higher in the combined plus and regular groups than among controls (between‐group difference, 1360 steps per day; 95% CI, 694‐2026 steps per day; P <. 001), but trends in total daily steps and MVPA were similar in the plus and regular groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this trial, the intervention groups substantially increased their physical activity. However, use of both the app and accelerometer for an additional 6 months after the initial 3‐month intervention did not help to maintain increases in physical activity compared with continued use of the accelerometer alone. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01280812.

AB  - Background: Caregivers play a pivotal role in maintaining an economically viable health care system, yet they are characterized by low levels of psychological well‐being and consistently report unmet needs for psychological support. Mobile app‐based (mobile health [mHealth]) interventions present a novel approach to both reducing stress and improving well‐being. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a self‐guided mobile app‐based psychological intervention for people providing care to family or friends with a physical or mental disability. Methods: In a randomized, single‐blind, controlled trial, 183 caregivers recruited through the web were randomly allocated to either an intervention (n=73) or active control (n=110) condition. The intervention app contained treatment modules combining daily self‐monitoring with third‐wave (mindfulness‐based) cognitive‐behavioral therapies, whereas the active control app contained only self‐monitoring features. Both programs were completed over a 5‐week period. It was hypothesized that intervention app exposure would be associated with decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress, and increases in well‐being, self‐esteem, optimism, primary and secondary control, and social support. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 3‐4 months postintervention. App quality was also assessed. Results: In total, 25% (18/73) of the intervention participants were lost to follow‐up at 3 months, and 30.9% (34/110) of the participants from the wait‐list control group dropped out before the postintervention survey. The intervention group experienced reductions in stress (b=−2.07; P=.04) and depressive symptoms (b=−1.36; P=.05) from baseline to postintervention. These changes were further enhanced from postintervention to follow‐up, with the intervention group continuing to report lower levels of depression (b=−1.82; P=.03) and higher levels of emotional well‐being (b=6.13; P<.001), optimism (b=0.78; P=.007), self‐esteem (b=−0.84; P=.005), support from family (b=2.15; P=.001), support from significant others (b=2.66; P<.001), and subjective well‐being (b=4.82; P<.001). On average, participants completed 2.5 (SD 1.05) out of 5 treatment modules. The overall quality of the app was also rated highly, with a mean score of 3.94 out of a maximum score of 5 (SD 0.58). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that mHealth psychological interventions are an effective treatment option for caregivers experiencing high levels of stress. Recommendations for improving mHealth interventions for caregivers include offering flexibility and customization in the treatment design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A strong and growing body of evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), either face-to-face, in person, or as self-help via the Internet, for depression. However, CBT is a complex intervention consisting of several putatively effective components, and how each component may or may not contribute to the overall effectiveness of CBT is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate how the users of smartphone CBT use and benefit from various components of the program. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis from a 9-week, single-blind, randomized controlled trial that has demonstrated the effectiveness of adjunctive use of smartphone CBT (Kokoro-App) over antidepressant pharmacotherapy alone among patients with drug-resistant major depressive disorder (total n=164, standardized mean difference in depression severity at week 9=0.40, J Med Internet Res). Kokoro-App consists of three cognitive behavioral skills of self-monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring, with corresponding worksheets to fill in. All activities of the participants learning each session of the program and completing each worksheet were uploaded onto Kokoro-Web, which each patient could use for self-check. We examined what use characteristics differentiated the more successful users of the CBT app from the less successful ones, split at the median of change in depression severity. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients with major depression were allocated to the smartphone CBT. On average, they completed 7.0 (standard deviation [SD] 1.4) out of 8 sessions of the program; it took them 10.8 (SD 4.2) days to complete one session, during which they spent 62 min (SD 96) on the app. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of sessions completed, time spent for the program, or the number of completed self-monitoring worksheets between the beneficiaries and the nonbeneficiaries. However, the former completed more behavioral activation tasks, engaged in different types of activities, and also filled in more cognitive restructuring worksheets than the latter. Activities such as "test-drive a new car," "go to a coffee shop after lunch," or "call up an old friend" were found to be particularly rewarding. All cognitive restructuring strategies were found to significantly decrease the distress level, with "What would be your advice to a friend who has a similar problem?" found more helpful than some other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The CBT program offered via smartphone and connected to the remote server is not only effective in alleviating depression but also opens a new avenue in gathering information of what and how each participant may utilize the program. The activities and strategies found useful in this analysis will provide valuable information in brush-ups of the program itself and of mobile health (mHealth) in general.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that about 6 out of 10 users have installed a fitness tracking application on their smartphone. Nevertheless, more than 59% of adults do not engage in sufficient daily physical activity and much remains unknown with regard to the effectiveness of mobile applications. By adopting the Theory of Planned Behavior, we tested whether the use of fitness apps for daily steps tracking could positively influence people's health behavior. METHODS: Participants (N.=78) were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions; in one condition, they were asked to adopt a fitness app for two weeks. No information regarding mobile apps was given for participants in the control condition. In order to test the effects of using a fitness app, a series of two‐way mixed ANOVAs were conducted. RESULTS: Participants in the experimental condition reported more favorable attitudes in the post‐test compared to the pre‐test, t(43)=4.09, P<0.001, d=0.65. By contrast, in the control condition, the difference on attitudes between pre‐test and post‐test was not significant (P=1.00). They also reported higher perceived behavioral control (PBC) scores, t(43) =4.97, P<0.001, d=0.75, whereas the difference on PBC for the control condition was not significant (P=0.27). Participants who used a fitness app reported to have walked more in the post‐test compared to the pre‐test, t(43) =2.41, P=0.02, d=0.36, whereas self‐reported behavior did not change for participants in the control condition (P=0.46). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides encouraging evidence for the positive effects of using a fitness‐tracking app in promoting health behavior.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brief interventions via the internet have been shown to reduce university students' alcohol intake. This study tested two smartphone applications (apps) targeting drinking choices on party occasions, with the goal of reducing problematic alcohol intake among Swedish university students. METHODS: Students were recruited via e‐mails sent to student union members at two universities. Those who gave informed consent, had a smartphone, and showed risky alcohol consumption according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) were randomized into three groups. Group 1 had access to the Swedish government alcohol monopoly's app, Promillekoll, offering real‐time estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) calculation; Group 2 had access to a web‐based app, PartyPlanner, developed by the research group, offering real‐time eBAC calculation with planning and follow‐up functions; and Group 3 participants were controls. Follow‐up was conducted at 7 weeks. RESULTS: Among 28574 students offered participation, 4823 agreed to join; 415 were excluded due to incomplete data, and 1932 fulfilled eligibility criteria for randomization. Attrition was 22.7‐39.3 percent, higher among heavier drinkers and highest in Group 2. Self‐reported app use was higher in Group 1 (74%) compared to Group 2 (41%). Per‐protocol analyses revealed only one significant time‐by‐group interaction, where Group 1 participants increased the frequency of their drinking occasions compared to controls (p = 0.001). Secondary analyses by gender showed a significant difference among men in Group 1 for frequency of drinking occasions per week (p = 0.001), but not among women. Among all participants, 29 percent showed high‐risk drinking, over the recommended weekly drinking levels of 9 (women) and 14 (men) standard glasses. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone apps can make brief interventions available to large numbers of university students. The apps studied using eBAC calculation did not, however, seem to affect alcohol consumption among university students and one app may have led to a negative effect among men. Future research should: 1) explore ways to increase user retention, 2) include apps facilitating technical manipulation for evaluation of added components, 3) explore the effects of adapting app content to possible gender differences, and 4) offer additional interventions to high‐risk users.

AB  - PURPOSE: University students in a study on estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) feedback apps were offered participation in a second study, if reporting continued excessive consumption at 6‐week follow‐up. This study evaluated the effects on excessive alcohol consumption of offering access to an additional skills training app. METHOD: A total of 186 students with excessive alcohol consumption were randomized to an intervention group or a wait list group. Both groups completed online follow‐ups regarding alcohol consumption after 6 and 12 weeks. Wait list participants were given access to the intervention at 6‐week follow‐up. Assessment‐only controls (n = 144) with excessive alcohol consumption from the ongoing study were used for comparison. RESULTS: The proportion of participants with excessive alcohol consumption declined in both intervention and wait list groups compared to controls at first (p < 0.001) and second follow‐ups (p = 0.054). Secondary analyses showed reductions for the intervention group in quantity of drinking at first follow‐up (‐4.76, 95% CI [‐6.67, ‐2.85], Z = ‐2.09, p = 0.037) and in frequency of drinking at both follow‐ups (‐0.83, 95% CI [‐1.14, ‐0.52], Z = ‐2.04, p = 0.041; ‐0.89, 95% CI [‐1.16, ‐0.62], Z = ‐2.12, p = 0.034). The odds ratio for not having excessive alcohol consumption among men in the intervention group compared to male controls was 2.68, 95% CI [1.37, 5.25] (Z = 2.88, p = 0.004); the figure for women was 1.71, 95% CI [1.11, 2.64] (Z = 2.41, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Skills training apps have potential for reducing excessive alcohol use among university students. Future research is still needed to disentangle effects of app use from emailed feedback on excessive alcohol consumption and study participation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02064998.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness applications are popular tools for improving well-being, but their effectiveness is unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that employed a mindfulness meditation app as the main intervention to improve users' well-being and mental-health related outcomes. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, the Cochrane Library, Open Grey and ResearchGate through June, 2020. Effects were calculated as standardized mean difference (Hedges' g) between app-delivered mindfulness interventions and control conditions at post-test and pooled with a random-effects model. RESULTS: From 2637 records, we selected 34 trials (N = 7566). Significant effect sizes were found at post-test for perceived stress (n = 15; g = 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, .68], I2= 68%), anxiety (n = 15; g = 0.28, 95% CI [0.16, .40], I2= 35%), depression (n = 15; g = 0.33, 95% CI [0.24, .43], I2= 0%), and psychological well-being (n = 5; g = 0.29, 95% CI [0.14, .45], I2= 0%). No significant effects were found for distress at post-test (n = 6; g = 0.10, 95% CI [-0.02, .22], I2= 11%) and general well-being (n = 5; g = 0.14, 95% CI [-0.02, 0.29], I2 = 14%). CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS: Mindfulness apps seem promising in improving well-being and mental-health, though results should be interpreted carefully due to the small number of included studies, overall uncertain risk of bias and heterogeneity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information and communication technologies are currently among the supporting elements that may contribute to improving health and changing lifestyles. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of adding an app to standardized counseling in order to increase physical activity (PA) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet and to analyze the effects of app adherence in lifestyle changes. METHODS: A randomized, multicenter clinical trial with a 12 month-follow up was conducted, involving 833 participants recruited by random sampling in 6 primary Spanish care centers (415 vs 418). Counseling on PA and the Mediterranean diet was given to both groups by a research nurse; however, the counseling + app group (intervention group) received additional training in the use of an app that was designed to promote the Mediterranean diet and PA over a 3-month period. Main outcomes and measures included PA by accelerometer and the 7-day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) questionnaire and adherence to the Mediterranean diet by an adherence screener questionnaire. We considered adherence to the app to be high when it was used for more than 60 days. RESULTS: The mean age was 51 years (SD 12) in the intervention group and 52.3 years (SD 12.0) in the counseling-only group; females predominated in both groups (60.0%, 249/415 and 64.1%, 268/418, respectively). PA by accelerometer declined in both groups at 12 months (P value for tendency in moderate to vigorous PA, [MVPA]=.15). The intervention subgroup with high app adherence had better behavior than the low adherence subgroup (P value for tendency in MVPA=.001). PA analyzed by 7-day PAR did not show changes at 12 months in any of the groups (P value for tendency=.25). In the Mediterranean diet, an increase in adherence was observed in both groups at 12 months with no differences between them (P value for tendency=.46). In these two cases, the group with high app adherence also had better behavior, although without reaching significance for the tendency (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: The participants with strongest app adherence showed better outcomes in terms of maintenance of healthy lifestyles at 12 months than those with weaker adherence. Overall, however, we found no differences between intervention group and counseling-only group in PA increase and adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the long term.

AB  - Smartphone applications (apps) improve accessibility to smoking cessation treatments. The NoFumo+ app administers a cognitive behavioral therapy program for smoking cessation. This study evaluates the efficacy of NoFumo+ for quitting smoking or reducing cigarette consumption versus the usual information‐based treatment. A clinical trial was conducted with 99 hospitalized smokers, 54 pseudo‐randomly assigned to the app treatment and 45 to the usual treatment. The two groups had homogeneous baseline characteristics to ensure comparability. Abstinence was evaluated at post‐treatment (two months) and at a six‐month follow‐up. The results obtained indicate that participants who receive the usual treatment are 5.40 times more likely to continue smoking than those who undergo the app treatment (95% CI = [1.35; 20.15]). Participants who do not succeed in quitting smoking with the app manage to decrease their habitual consumption. Users who successfully complete treatment with NoFumo+ access all its contents and use the chat, but without requesting professional support. There is not enough empirical evidence to attribute this success to any specific element of the app. NoFumo+ achieves better abstinence rates than the usual information‐based treatments, and the goal of generalizing its use to the non‐hospitalized smoking population may be achievable in the future.

AB  - Adherence to cardiovascular medications following acute coronary syndrome hospitalization is generally poor. The primary outcome was to demonstrate that the use of a digital application for smartphones increases the adherence to pharmacological treatment by 30 % in relation to the group without intervention, in patients with an acute coronary syndrome with or without ST segment elevation. In this unicentric, single blinded, randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation we compared the use of a digital application for smartphones and written information as standard of care, for the adherence to pharmacological treatment in 90 patients admitted to the hospital with an acute coronary syndrome. Adherence to medical treatment was measured by Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. A patient is considered to have good adherence when score is perfect (8 points). The follow up period was 90 days after hospital discharge. The mean age of the population was 63 ± 9 and 76% were male. At 90 days, 67.4% (31/46) of patients using the smartphone application were adherent compared with 20.5% (9/44) of patients in the control group (p < 0.001). In patients with acute coronary syndrome, the use of a smartphone application increased the medication adherence compared with the standard of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital interventions for alcohol can help achieve reductions in hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. The Drink Less app was developed using evidence and theory, and a factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested that 4 of its intervention modules may assist with drinking reduction. However, low engagement is an important barrier to effectiveness, and low response to follow up is a challenge for intervention evaluation. Research is needed to understand what factors influence users' level of engagement, response to follow up, and extent of alcohol reduction. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate associations between user characteristics, engagement, response to follow up, and extent of alcohol reduction in an app-based intervention, Drink Less. METHODS: This study involved a secondary data analysis of a factorial RCT of the Drink Less app. Participants (N=672) were aged 18 years or older, lived in the United Kingdom, and had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score >7 (indicative of excessive drinking). Sociodemographic and drinking characteristics were assessed at baseline. Engagement was assessed in the first month of use (number of sessions, time on app, number of days used, and percentage of available screens viewed). Response to follow up and extent of alcohol reduction (change in past week consumption) were measured after 1 month. Associations were assessed using unadjusted and adjusted linear or logistic regression models. RESULTS: Age (all unstandardized regression coefficients [B] >.02, all P<.001) and post-16 educational qualifications (all B>.18, all P<.03) were positively associated with all engagement outcomes. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, P<.001), educational qualifications (OR 2.11, P<.001), and female gender (OR 1.58, P=.02) were positively associated with response to follow up. Engagement outcomes predicted response to follow up (all OR>1.02, all P<.001) but not the extent of alcohol reduction (all -.14<B<-.06, all P>.07). Baseline drinking characteristics were the only variables associated with the extent of alcohol reduction among those followed up (all B>.49, all P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Users of the alcohol reduction app, Drink Less, who were older and had post-16 educational qualifications engaged more and were more likely to respond at 1-month follow up. Higher baseline alcohol consumption predicted a greater extent of alcohol reduction among those followed up but did not predict engagement or response to follow up. Engagement was associated with response to follow up but was not associated with the extent of alcohol reduction, which suggests that the Drink Less app does not have a dose-response effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing worldwide. A healthy diet and stable blood glucose levels during pregnancy can prevent adverse health outcomes for the mother and the newborn child. Mobile health may be a useful supplement to prenatal care, providing women with targeted dietary information concerning GDM. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed secondary data from a two‐arm, multicentered, nonblinded randomized controlled trial to determine if a smartphone app with targeted dietary information and blood glucose monitoring had an effect on the dietary behavior of women with GDM. METHODS: Women with a 2‐hour oral glucose tolerance test level of ≥9 mmol/L were individually randomized to either the intervention group receiving the Pregnant+ app and usual care or the control group receiving usual care only. Eligible women were enrolled from 5 diabetes outpatient clinics in the Oslo region, Norway, between October 2015 and April 2017. The Pregnant+ app promoted 10 GDM‐specific dietary recommendations. A healthy dietary score for Pregnant+ (HDS‐P+) was constructed from a 41‐item food frequency questionnaire and used to assess the intervention effect on the dietary behavior completed at trial entry and at around gestation week 36. Dietary changes from baseline to week 36 were examined by a paired sample two‐tailed t test. Between‐group dietary differences after the intervention were estimated with analysis of covariance, with adjustment for baseline diet. RESULTS: A total of 238 women participated: 115 were allocated to the intervention group and 123 to the control group. Of the 238 women, 193 (81.1%) completed the food frequency questionnaire both at baseline and around gestational week 36. All the participants showed improvements in their HDS‐P+ from baseline. However, the Pregnant+ app did not have a significant effect on their HDS‐P+. The control group reported a higher weekly frequency of choosing fish meals (P=.05). No other significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups. There were no significant demographic baseline differences between the groups, except that more women in the intervention group had a non‐Norwegian language as their first language (61 vs 46; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the supplementation of face‐to‐face follow‐up of women with GDM with a smartphone app in the presence of high‐standard usual care, as the Pregnant+ app did not have a beneficial effect on pregnant women's diet.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mindfulness training may reduce smoking rates and lessen the association between craving and smoking. This trial tested the efficacy of mindfulness training via smartphone app to reduce smoking. Experience sampling (ES) was used to measure real‐time craving, smoking, and mindfulness. METHODS: A researcher‐blind, parallel randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of mobile mindfulness training with experience sampling (MMT‐ES; Craving to Quit) versus experience sampling only (ES) to (1) increase 1‐week point‐prevalence abstinence rates at 6 months, and (2) lessen the association between craving and smoking. A modified intent‐to‐treat approach was used for treatment starters (MMT‐ES n = 143; ES n = 182; 72% female, 81% white, age 41 ± 12 year). RESULTS: No group difference was found in smoking abstinence at 6 months (overall, 11.1%; MMT‐ES, 9.8%; ES, 12.1%; χ2(1) = 0.43, p = .51). From baseline to 6 months, both groups showed a reduction in cigarettes per day (p < .0001), craving strength (p < .0001) and frequency (p < .0001), and an increase in mindfulness (p < .05). Using ES data, a craving by group interaction was observed (F(1,3785) = 3.71, p = .05) driven by a stronger positive association between craving and cigarettes per day for ES (t = 4.96, p < .0001) versus MMT‐ES (t = 2.03, p = .04). Within MMT‐ES, the relationship between craving and cigarettes per day decreased as treatment completion increased (F(1,104) = 4.44, p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Although mindfulness training via smartphone app did not lead to reduced smoking rates compared with control, our findings provide preliminary evidence that mindfulness training via smartphone app may help lessen the association between craving and smoking, an effect that may be meaningful to support quitting in the longer term. IMPLICATIONS: This is the first reported full‐scale randomized controlled trial of any smartphone app for smoking cessation. Findings provide preliminary evidence that smartphone app‐based MMT‐ES may lessen the association between craving and smoking. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02134509.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of a smartphone application (app) providing information and support for medication abortion (MA) on the primary outcomes of 'feelings of support' and 'preparedness' among clients of Samsara, a safe‐abortion hotline in Indonesia. METHODS: In a parallel‐arm, non‐clinical, randomized controlled trial, women (ages ≥15) who contacted Samsara between February 2017‐ July 2018 seeking information on MA for pregnancies ≤13 weeks gestation were randomized to receive either an app with abortion information, or standard of care (high‐quality comprehensive and empathic counseling on pregnancy options). Participants completed a questionnaire 24 days after enrollment; Fisher exact tests and risk differences were used to assess differences in self‐reported feelings of preparedness and support throughout the process of self‐managed MA. RESULTS: No differences in feelings of support or preparedness were detected between participants in the app arm versus the standard of care arm. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first‐ever randomized control trial (and prospective study) among those who contacted a safe‐abortion hotline for information about and support for self‐managed abortion. Levels of preparedness, confidence, and feelings of support were all extremely high among both control and intervention arms‐indicative of the high‐quality, evidence‐based information, comprehensive, and supportive abortion counseling that safe‐abortion hotline clients receive.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychoeducation has turned into an effective tool in taking care of cancer patients and improving their psychophysical symptoms and quality of life. Despite the growing use of mobile phone apps in medical settings for improving health, evidence supporting their effectiveness in the psychoeducation of patients with breast cancer is rarely available. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate the effect of psychoeducational interventions on anxiety and self‐esteem in women with breast cancer using a mobile app and an online support group. METHODS: An unblinded randomized controlled trial based on mobile phones was conducted in Shiraz, Iran. A research assistant recruited 82 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer aged 20 to 60 years were from clinics during a face‐to‐face visit at the point of care and randomly assigned to an intervention group (n=41) and a wait‐list control group (n=41) through blocked randomization. The intervention group received psychoeducational interventions through a mobile phone app and participated in nurse‐assisted online mobile support sessions for a total four weeks, whereas the control group was put on a waiting list. The State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Scale (RSES) were used to measure the levels of anxiety and self‐esteem as the main outcomes at baseline and one week after the intervention. RESULTS: A total of 82 patients with a mean age of 46.45 (SD 9.29) years recruited in Winter 2016 were randomly assigned to a wait‐list control group (n=41) and intervention group (n=41). Five patients dropped out for different reasons. Comparing the postintervention mean scores of anxiety and its subscales using the independent t test showed statistically significant differences between the mobile psychoeducation group and controls (P<.001). The paired t test used to compare the postintervention mean scores of anxiety with its preintervention scores in the intervention group showed significant reductions in the scores of anxiety (95% CI ‐17.44 to ‐8.90, P<.001, d=1.02) and its two subscales (state anxiety: 95% CI ‐9.20 to ‐4.21, P<.001, d=0.88 and trait anxiety: 95% CI ‐8.50 to ‐4.12, P<.001, d=0.94). Comparing the postintervention mean scores of self‐esteem showed statistically insignificant differences between the control and intervention groups (16.87 vs 17.97, P=.24). In contrast with the controls, using the paired t test showed that the increase in the postintervention mean scores of self‐esteem were statistically significant in the intervention group compared with the preintervention scores (mean difference 2.05, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.82, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the key role of mobile apps in decreasing anxiety and improving self‐esteem in women with breast cancer through psychoeducational interventions. Similar studies with longer follow‐ups are recommended that be conducted in this context. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT2015072123279N2; https://en.irct.ir/trial/19882.

AB  - Over the last decade, mobile technology has emerged as a potentially useful platform to facilitate weight management and tackle the current obesity epidemic. Clinicians are being more frequently asked to give advice about the usefulness of mobile apps and many individuals have already integrated apps into their attempts to manage weight. Hence, it is imperative for clinicians involved in weight management to be aware of the latest developments and knowledge about available mobile apps and their usefulness in this field. A number of newly published studies have demonstrated promising results of mobile-based interventions for weight management across different populations, but the extent of their effectiveness remains widely debated. This narrative literature review synthesizes the latest evidence, primarily from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), regarding the clinical use of mobile applications for weight management, as well as highlight key limitations associated with their use and directions for future research and practice. Overall, evidence suggests that mobile applications may be useful as low-intensity approaches or adjuncts to conventional weight management strategies. However, there is insufficient evidence to support their use as stand-alone intensive approaches to weight management. Further research is needed to clarify the extent of utility of these applications, as well as the measures required to maximize their potential both as stand-alone approaches and adjuncts to more intensive programs.

AB  - Background: Inertial measurement units combined with a smartphone application (CuPiD‐system) were developed to provide people with Parkinson's disease (PD) real‐time feedback on gait performance. This study investigated the CuPiD‐system's feasibility and effectiveness compared with conventional gait training when applied in the home environment. Methods: Forty persons with PD undertook gait training for 30 min, three times per week for six weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to i) CuPiD, in which a smartphone application offered positive and corrective feedback on gait, or ii) an active control, in which personalized gait advice was provided. Gait, balance, endurance and quality of life were assessed before and after training and at four weeks follow‐up using standardized tests. Results: Both groups improved significantly on the primary outcomes (single and dual task gait speed) at post‐test and follow‐up. The CuPiD group improved significantly more on balance (MiniBESTest) at post‐test (from 24.8 to 26.1, SD~5) and maintained quality of life (SF‐36 physical health) at follow‐up whereas the control group deteriorated (from 50.4 to 48.3, SD~16). No other statistically significant differences were found between the two groups. The CuPiD system was well‐tolerated and participants found the tool user‐friendly. Conclusion: CuPiD was feasible, well‐accepted and seemed to be an effective approach to promote gait training, as participants improved equally to controls. This benefit may be ascribed to the real‐time feedback, stimulating corrective actions and promoting self‐efficacy to achieve optimal performance. Further optimization of the system and adequately‐powered studies are warranted to corroborate these findings and determine cost‐effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We estimated the efficacy of the Addiction‐Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A‐CHESS) in increasing the use of services for addiction and examined the extent to which this use of services mediated the effects of A‐CHESS on risky drinking days and abstinence from drinking. METHODS: We conducted secondary data analyses of the A‐CHESS randomized controlled trial. Recruitment occurred in five residential treatment programs operated by two addiction treatment organizations. Participants were 349 adults with alcohol use disorders recruited two weeks before discharge from residential treatment. We provided intervention arm participants with a smartphone, the A‐CHESS application, and an 8‐month service plan. Control arm participants received treatment as usual. Telephone interviews at 4, 8, and 12‐month follow‐ups assessed past‐month risky drinking days, past‐month abstinence, and post‐discharge service utilization (past‐month outpatient addiction treatment and past‐week mutual help including Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous). Using mixed effects latent variable models, we estimated the indirect effects of A‐CHESS on drinking outcomes, as mediated by post‐discharge service utilization. RESULTS: Approximately 50.5% of participants reported outpatient addiction treatment and 75.5% reported mutual help at any follow‐up interview in the year following randomization. Assignment to the A‐CHESS intervention was associated with an increased odds of outpatient addiction treatment across follow‐ups, but not mutual help. This use of outpatient addiction treatment mediated the effect of A‐CHESS on risky drinking days, but not abstinence. The effect of A‐CHESS through outpatient addiction treatment appeared to reduce the expected number of risky drinking days across follow‐ups by 11%. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile health (mHealth) intervention promoted the use of outpatient addiction treatment, which appeared to contribute to its efficacy in reducing risky drinking. Future research should investigate how mHealth interventions could link patients to needed treatment services and promote the sustained use of these services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a major, potentially modifiable, risk factor for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other chronic diseases. Effective, simple, and generalisable interventions that will increase physical activity in populations are needed. AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone application (app) to increase physical activity in primary care. DESIGN AND SETTING: An 8‐week, open‐label, randomised controlled trial in rural, primary care in the west of Ireland. METHOD: Android smartphone users >16 years of age were recruited. All participants were provided with similar physical activity goals and information on the benefits of exercise. The intervention group was provided with a smartphone app and detailed instructions on how to use it to achieve these goals. The primary outcome was change in physical activity, as measured by a daily step count between baseline and follow‐up. RESULTS: A total of 139 patients were referred by their primary care health professional or self‐referred. In total, 37 (27%) were screened out and 12 (9%) declined to participate, leaving 90 (65%) patients who were randomised. Of these, 78 provided baseline data (intervention = 37; control = 41) and 77 provided outcome data (intervention = 37; control = 40). The mean daily step count at baseline for intervention and control groups was 4365 and 5138 steps per day respectively. After adjusting, there was evidence of a significant treatment effect (P = 0.009); the difference in mean improvement in daily step count from week 1 to week 8 inclusive was 1029 (95% confidence interval 214 to 1843) steps per day, favouring the intervention. Improvements in physical activity in the intervention group were sustained until the end of the trial. CONCLUSION: A simple smartphone app significantly increased physical activity over 8 weeks in a primary care population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few weight loss interventions are evaluated for longer than a year, and even fewer employ social and mobile technologies commonly used among young adults. We assessed the efficacy of a 2 year, theory‐based, weight loss intervention that was remotely and adaptively delivered via integrated user experiences with Facebook, mobile apps, text messaging, emails, a website, and technology‐mediated communication with a health coach (the SMART intervention). METHODS: In this parallel‐group, randomised, controlled trial, we enrolled overweight or obese college students (aged 18‐35 years) from three universities in San Diego, CA, USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either the intervention (SMART intervention group) or general information about health and wellness (control group). We used computer‐based permuted‐block randomisation with block sizes of four, stratified by sex, ethnicity, and college. Participants, study staff, and investigators were masked until the intervention was assigned. The primary outcome was objectively measured weight in kg at 24 months. Differences between groups were evaluated using linear mixed‐effects regression within an intention‐to‐treat framework. Objectively measured weight at 6, 12, and 18 months was included as a secondary outcome. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01200459. FINDINGS: Between May 18, 2011, and May 17, 2012, 404 individuals were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=202) or control (n=202). Participants' mean (SD) age was 22·7 (3·8) years. 284 (70%) participants were female and 125 (31%) were Hispanic. Mean (SD) body‐mass index at baseline was 29·0 (2·8) kg/m(2). At 24 months, weight was assessed in 341 (84%) participants, but all 404 were included in analyses. Weight, adjusted for sex, ethnicity, and college, was not significantly different between the groups at 24 months (‐0·79 kg [95% CI ‐2·02 to 0·43], p=0·204). However, weight was significantly less in the intervention group compared with the control group at 6 months (‐1·33 kg [95% CI ‐2·36 to ‐0·30], p=0·011) and 12 months (‐1·33 kg [‐2·30 to ‐0·35], p=0·008), but not 18 months (‐0·67 kg [95% CI ‐1·69 to 0·35], p=0·200). One serious adverse event in the intervention group (gallstones) could be attributable to rapid and excessive weight loss. INTERPRETATION: Social and mobile technologies did not facilitate sustained reductions in weight among young adults, although these approaches might facilitate limited short‐term weight loss.

AB  - Background: A growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest psychological benefits associated with meditation training delivered via mobile health. However, research in this area has primarily focused on mindfulness, only one of many meditative techniques. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of 2 versions of a self‐guided, smartphone‐based meditation app‐the Healthy Minds Program (HMP)‐which includes training in mindfulness (Awareness), along with practices designed to cultivate positive relationships (Connection) or insight into the nature of the self (Insight). Methods: A three‐arm, fully remote RCT compared 8 weeks of one of 2 HMP conditions (Awareness+Connection and Awareness+Insight) with a waitlist control. Adults (≥18 years) without extensive previous meditation experience were eligible. The primary outcome was psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress). Secondary outcomes were social connection, empathy, compassion, self‐reflection, insight, rumination, defusion, and mindfulness. Measures were completed at pretest, midtreatment, and posttest between October 2019 and April 2020. Longitudinal data were analyzed using intention‐to‐treat principles with maximum likelihood. Results: A total of 343 participants were randomized and 186 (54.2%) completed at least one posttest assessment. The majority (166/228, 72.8%) of those assigned to HMP conditions downloaded the app. The 2 HMP conditions did not differ from one another in terms of changes in any outcome. Relative to the waitlist control, the HMP conditions showed larger improvements in distress, social connectedness, mindfulness, and measures theoretically linked to insight training (d=‐0.28 to 0.41; Ps≤.02), despite modest exposure to connection‐ and insight‐related practice. The results were robust to some assumptions about nonrandom patterns of missing data. Improvements in distress were associated with days of use. Candidate mediators (social connection, insight, rumination, defusion, and mindfulness) and moderators (baseline rumination, defusion, and empathy) of changes in distress were identified. Conclusions: This study provides initial evidence of efficacy for the HMP app in reducing distress and improving outcomes related to well‐being, including social connectedness. Future studies should attempt to increase study retention and user engagement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study is a secondary analysis of the Live SMART trial, a randomized controlled trial comparing a behavioral weight loss (BWL) condition delivered via smartphone (SMART) to a group‐based BWL condition (GROUP) and a control condition (CONTROL). Given the established importance of self‐monitoring for weight loss, the aims were to evaluate bidirectional associations between adherence to self‐monitoring and weight change and to examine the moderating effect of treatment condition on these associations. METHOD: Adults with overweight/obesity (n = 276; 83% women; 92.8% White; Mage = 55.1 years; Mbody mass index = 35.2 kg/m2) were instructed to self‐monitor dietary intake, daily weight, and physical activity minutes via paper diaries in GROUP and CONTROL and via a smartphone application in SMART. All participants were weighed monthly at the research center. Adherence to self‐monitoring was assessed via examination of self‐monitoring records. RESULTS: Generalized linear mixed models revealed that adherence to self‐monitoring of dietary intake, self‐weighing, and physical activity for each month was associated with weight change throughout that month, such that increased frequency of self‐monitoring led to greater weight loss (ps < .001). For the GROUP condition only, poorer weight losses in 1 month were prospectively associated with poor adherence to self‐monitoring the following month (ps â‰¤ .01). CONCLUSIONS: Results provide evidence of a bidirectional association between self‐monitoring and weight change. Better self‐monitoring was consistently associated with better weight loss across intervention and tracking modalities. Poorer weight loss was prospectively associated with poorer self‐monitoring in group treatment, suggesting that social influences could drive adherence in this form of treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence on the efficacy of smartphone applications (apps) for reducing body weight and other measurements of adiposity sustainably is not conclusive. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of adding an app for 3 months to traditional counselling on physical activity (PA) and a heart‐healthy diet for the modification of measurements of adiposity at 3 and 12 months after intervention. METHODS: This randomised clinical trial included 833 subjects. The counselling and app group (IG) had 415 subjects, while 418 were included in the counselling only group (CG). The primary outcome was adiposity measurements at 3 and 12 months after intervention. The secondary outcome was the effect of the intervention by sex. INTERVENTION: Counselling on a heart‐healthy diet and PA was given to both groups. The IG also received training in the use of a smartphone app designed to promote a heart‐healthy diet and PA, and this group was given access to this application for 3 months. Outcome measurements included waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and Clínica Universidad de Navarra ‐ body adiposity estimator (CUN‐BAE). RESULTS: In the IG at 12 months, the following decreased: WC ‐0.72 cm (95% confidence interval [CI]: ‐2.35 to ‐0.02) and CUN‐BAE ‐0.35 (95% CI: ‐0.63 to ‐0.06). These decreases were only observed in women. After baseline adjustment, the beneficial effect was maintained in the IG compared to the CG at 12 months in terms of WC (‐0.67; 95% CI: ‐0.29 to ‐0.02) and CUN‐BAE (‐0.57; 95% CI: ‐1.10 to ‐0.04), but only in women. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention of nutritional counselling and PA plus the smartphone app with personalised recommendations compared to CG showed beneficial results in terms of reduction of abdominal obesity and the percentage of body fat in women, but not in men.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delivering self‐management support to people with type 2 diabetes mellitus is essential to reduce the health system burden and to empower people with the skills, knowledge, and confidence needed to take an active role in managing their own health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the adoption, use, and effectiveness of the My Diabetes Coach (MDC) program, an app‐based interactive embodied conversational agent, Laura, designed to support diabetes self‐management in the home setting over 12 months. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial evaluated both the implementation and effectiveness of the MDC program. Adults with type 2 diabetes in Australia were recruited and randomized to the intervention arm (MDC) or the control arm (usual care). Program use was tracked over 12 months. Coprimary outcomes included changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). Data were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months, and analyzed using linear mixed‐effects regression models. RESULTS: A total of 187 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean 57 years, SD 10 years; 41.7% women) were recruited and randomly allocated to the intervention (n=93) and control (n=94) arms. MDC program users (92/93 participants) completed 1942 chats with Laura, averaging 243 min (SD 212) per person over 12 months. Compared with baseline, the mean estimated HbA1c decreased in both arms at 12 months (intervention: 0.33% and control: 0.20%), but the net differences between the two arms in change of HbA1c (‐0.04%, 95% CI ‐0.45 to 0.36; P=.83) was not statistically significant. At 12 months, HRQoL utility scores improved in the intervention arm, compared with the control arm (between‐arm difference: 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.07; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: The MDC program was successfully adopted and used by individuals with type 2 diabetes and significantly improved the users' HRQoL. These findings suggest the potential for wider implementation of technology‐enabled conversation‐based programs for supporting diabetes self‐management. Future studies should focus on strategies to maintain program usage and HbA1c improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is 1 of the major global public health challenges, which means that patients with hypertension need more measures to control their blood pressure. Currently, smart phones and applications are developing rapidly, and mobile health applications are used to manage hypertension, but evidences related to effectiveness are limited. OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to assess the impact of m‐Health apps on blood pressure control, medication adherence. METHODS: 480 participants were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The intervention group used the "Yan Fu" app to manage their blood pressure, and the control group did not use any m‐Health apps. The outcomes were changes in blood pressure, the percentage of participants with their blood pressure under control and medication adherence. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups had no statistically differences (P > .05). Participants in the 2 groups all had lower systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure than they did at baseline, and the intervention group demonstrated a significantly greater systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure reduction than the control group (P < .05). Additionally, the percentage of participants with controlled blood pressure was higher in the intervention group (P < .05). The medication adherence of the intervention group was much higher than that of the control group (P < .05). CONCLUSION: M‐Health apps are effective for hypertension management, it can favor the medication adherence and blood pressure control. Perhaps m‐Health apps can be promoted in the blood pressure control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under the number ChiCTR‐IOR‐17012069.

AB  - Background and objective: The last few years have seen the appearance many mobile applications aimed at improving health, but studies analyzing their effectiveness on cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) are few and far between. Our aim was to assess the effect on CVRFs such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes and global CVR, of adding the use of a smartphone app to an intervention consisting of standard counseling on physical activity and the Mediterranean diet. Method: This is a multicenter, randomized and controlled clinical trial. From January 2014 and September 2016, a total of 833 subjects selected by random sampling from six health centers participated. Of these, 415 were assigned to the counseling + app group (IG) and 418 to the counseling only group (CG). The IG additionally received training in the use of a mobile application. The main outcome was the change in CVRFs and estimated CVR at 3 and 12 months in the IG compared to the CG. Results: No significant changes were observed at 3 or 12 months in terms of CVR. Nevertheless, an effect between groups was observed in favor of the CG at 12 months in some CVRFS: SBP, DBP, total cholesterol and triglycerides: 2.02 mmHg (95%CI: 0.43–3.61), 1.21 mmHg (95%CI: 0.20–2.24), 5.24 mg/dl (95%CI: 1.22–9.26) and 7.24 mg/dl (95%CI: 0.53–14.32). Conclusion: Adding an intervention with the use of an app for three months to standard counseling on diet and physical activity, does not provide additional benefits for improving CVRFs or the estimated CVR in the long term.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design allows for changes in the intervention during the trial period. Despite its potential and feasibility for defining the best sequence of interventions, so far, it has not been utilized in a smartphone/gamified intervention for physical activity. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the feasibility of the SMART design for assessing the effects of a smartphone app intervention to improve physical activity in adults. We also aimed to describe the participants' perception regarding the protocol and the use of the app for physical activity qualitatively. METHODS: We conducted a feasibility 24-week/two-stage SMART in which 18 insufficiently active participants (<10,000 steps/day) were first randomized to group 1 (smartphone app only), group 2 (smartphone app + tailored messages), and a control group (usual routine during the protocol). Participants were motivated to increase their step count by at least 2000 steps/day each week. Based on the 12-week intermediate outcome, responders continued the intervention and nonresponders were rerandomized to subsequent treatment, including a new group 3 (smartphone app + tailored messages + gamification) in which they were instructed to form groups to use several game elements available in the chosen app (Pacer). We considered responders as those with any positive slope in the linear relationship between weeks and steps per day at the end of the first stage of the intervention. We compared the accelerometer-based steps per day before and after the intervention, as well as the slopes of the app-based steps per day between the first and second stages of the intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants, including five controls, finished the intervention. We identified two responders in group 1. We did not observe relevant changes in the steps per day either throughout the intervention or compared with the control group. However, the rerandomization of five nonresponders led to a change in the slope of the steps per day (median -198 steps/day [IQR -279 to -103] to 20 steps/day [IQR -204 to 145]; P=.08). Finally, in three participants from group 2, we observed an increase in the number of steps per day up to the sixth week, followed by an inflection to baseline values or even lower (ie, a quadratic relationship). The qualitative analysis showed that participants' reports could be classified into the following: (1) difficulty in managing the app and technology or problems with the device, (2) suitable response to the app, and (3) difficulties to achieve the goals. CONCLUSIONS: The SMART design was feasible and changed the behavior of steps per day after rerandomization. Rerandomization should be implemented earlier to take advantage of tailored messages. Additionally, difficulties with technology and realistic and individualized goals should be considered in interventions for physical activity using smartphones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant candidates (KTCs) must provide informed consent to accept kidneys from increased risk donors (IRD), but poorly understand them. We conducted a multisite, randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a mobile Web application, Inform Me, for increasing knowledge about IRDs. METHODS: Kidney transplant candidates undergoing transplant evaluation at 2 transplant centers were randomized to use Inform Me after routine transplant education (intervention) or routine transplant education alone (control). Computer adaptive learning method reinforced learning by embedding educational material, and initial (test 1) and additional test questions (test 2) into each chapter. Knowledge (primary outcome) was assessed in person after education (tests 1 and 2), and 1 week later by telephone (test 3). Controls did not receive test 2. Willingness to accept an IRD kidney (secondary outcome) was assessed after tests 1 and 3. Linear regression test 1 knowledge scores were used to test the significance of Inform Me exposure after controlling for covariates. Multiple imputation was used for intention‐to‐treat analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty‐eight KTCs participated. Intervention participants had higher test 1 knowledge scores (mean difference, 6.61; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.37‐7.86) than control participants, representing a 44% higher score than control participants' scores. Intervention participants' knowledge scores increased with educational reinforcement (test 2) compared with control arm test 1 scores (mean difference, 9.50; 95% CI, 8.27‐10.73). After 1 week, intervention participants' knowledge remained greater than controls' knowledge (mean difference, 3.63; 95% CI, 2.49‐4.78) (test 3). Willingness to accept an IRD kidney did not differ between study arms at tests 1 and 3. CONCLUSIONS: Inform Me use was associated with greater KTC knowledge about IRD kidneys above routine transplant education alone.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are prevalent in both civilian and military service members. As the number of smartphone-based applications (apps) grows rapidly in health care, apps are also increasingly used to help individuals with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Yet, if the apps are self-managed, the feasibility and efficacy of such interventions are still rather unclear in these two populations with PTSD symptoms. Hence, the present meta-analysis set out to evaluate the effect of self-management smartphone-based apps on PTSD and depressive symptoms in populations with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Studies were included if they conducted randomized controlled trials or pre-post comparisons. Six studies (n = 2 randomized controlled trials) were identified for meta-analysis. In pre-post comparisons, N = 209 participants were included in the analyses. In randomized controlled trials, N = 87 participants received smartphone-based self-management interventions and N = 82 participants were in waitlist control conditions. Meta-analysis for pre-post comparisons concluded an effect of g = 0.55 (p < 0.001) regarding the overall reduction in PTSD symptoms (n = 6) and g = 0.45 (p < 0.001) for reduction in depressive symptoms (n = 5). Yet, in randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was found between app-based treatment and waitlist control groups (g = 0.09, p = 0.574). The duration of the interventions did not significantly influence the results. Overall, despite positive pre-post effects, current results indicate that smartphone-apps for PTSD patients are not significantly more effective than waitlist control conditions. Nevertheless, a combined smartphone and standard therapy approach may be a fruitful field for future research.

AB  - PURPOSE: Upper airway exercises for snoring treatment can be effective but difficult to administer and monitor. We hypothesized that a brief, relatively simple daily upper airway exercise regimen, administered by a smartphone application, would reduce snoring and encourage compliance. METHODS: Targeted vowel sounds causing tongue base movements were incorporated into a voice‐controlled smartphone game application. Participants with habitual snoring, apnea hypopnea index (AHI) ≤ 14 events/h, and BMI ≤ 32 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to perform 15 min of daily gameplay (intervention group) or 5 s of daily voice recording (control group) and to audio record their snoring for 2 nights/week for up to 12 weeks. Sounds above 60 dB were extracted from recordings for snore classification with machine learning support vector machine classifiers. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (eight in each group) completed the protocol. Groups were similar at baseline in gender distribution (five males, three females), mean BMI (27.5 ± 3.8 vs 27.4 ± 3.8 kg/m2), neck circumference (15.1 ± 1.6 vs 14.7 ± 1.7 in.), Epworth Sleepiness Score (8 ± 3.5 vs 7 ± 4.0), and AHI (9.2 ± 4.0 vs 8.2 ± 3.2 events/h). At 8 weeks, the absolute change in snoring rate (> 60 dB/h) was greater for the intervention group than the control group (‐ 49.3 ± 55.3 vs ‐ 6.23 ± 23.2; p = 0.037), a 22 and 5.6% reduction, respectively. All bed partners of participants in the intervention group reported reduced snoring volume and frequency, whereas no change was reported for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone application‐administered upper airway training reduces objective and subjective snoring measures and improves sleep quality.

AB  - Importance: Depression and anxiety are common and disabling. Primary care is the de facto site for treating these mental health problems but is typically underresourced to meet the burden of these demands. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of a mobile intervention platform, IntelliCare, for addressing depression and anxiety among primary care patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Two‐arm randomized clinical trial at internal medicine clinics at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Adult primary care patients (N = 146) who screened positive for depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire‐8 (PHQ; score ≥ 10) or anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 (GAD‐7; score ≥ 8) were recruited between July 17, 2018, and December 14, 2018. Interventions: The coach‐supported platform composed of a suite of apps, was delivered over 8 weeks. Wait list control participants received treatment as usual for 8 weeks, then the mobile platform. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were changes in depression (PHQ‐9) and anxiety (GAD‐7) during the intervention period. Secondary outcomes were differences in the proportion of patients who achieved recovery (PHQ‐9/GAD‐7 <5 or 50% improvement from baseline), sustainment of intervention effects during 2‐month follow‐up, and app use during the intervention period. Results: One hundred forty‐six patients were included (119 of 146 were women [81.5%]; mean [SD] age, 42.3 [13.8] years). Of the 146 patients, 122 (83.6%) were diagnosed as having depression and 131 (89.7%) were diagnosed as having anxiety. A greater proportion of intervention vs wait list control participants achieved recovery from depression (n = 38 of 64 [59%] vs n = 18 of 58 [31%]; odds ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.54‐6.86) and anxiety (n = 37 of 65 [57%] vs n = 25 of 66 [38%]; odds ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.08‐4.36). Sustained effects were observed for depression (slope, 0.01; 95% CI, ‐0.09 to 0.10; P = .92) and anxiety scores (slope, 0.02; 95% CI, ‐0.08 to 0.12; P = .67) during follow‐up. App use was high, with a median of 93 and 98 sessions among participants with depression and anxiety, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this trial, a mobile intervention app was effective for depression and anxiety among primary care patients. Findings also support designing digital mental health interventions as platforms containing simple, brief apps that can be bundled by users to meet their needs. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03500536.

AB  - Abstract
The prevalence of university students experiencing high levels of stress, and the adverse effects of stress, provide a rationale for preventative services to reduce stress. Mindfulness-based therapies have shown promise attenuating stress and improving psychosocial wellbeing in student populations. Research has highlighted improvements in mood, stress and emotion regulation with mindfulness practice. The portability and ubiquity of mobile phones make them a promising target for health interventions. Few studies have tested the efficacy of mindfulness based mobile apps (MBMAs) and the viability of this format of delivery remains largely unknown. Some preliminary results suggest benefits. It is proposed that a MBMA may provide feasible and effective mental health support for students. Methods: To assess the efficacy of a MBMA, a sample of n54 university students new to mindfulness participated in a RCT. The study compared 7-days of mindfulness practice with an MBMA to an active control. It was hypothesised that mindfulness would reduce on measures of perceived stress, negative affect and emotion reactivity, and increase mindfulness and positive affect compared to the control. Results: No significant group differences were found for perceived stress or wellbeing. Both groups demonstrated a significant parallel decrease in negative affect with a large effect size. The mindfulness group reported significantly more acting with awareness compared to the control with a small effect size. Both groups demonstrated a significant parallel increase in mindfulness on FMI, FFMQ full scale and Non-React with large effect sizes. The mindfulness group reported significantly less emotion reactivity after listening to anger stories compared to the control with medium effect sizes. No significant differences to fear stories, facial EMG or Emotion Stroop were detected. Conclusion: The results of this study failed to provide support for the use of a MBMA to reduce student stress. Results indicate a MBMA intervention for seven days may cultivate the ability to act with awareness. The results provide partial support that a MBMA may reduce emotion reactivity. However, these findings should be viewed in the context of the failure to detect differences in the other measures of interest and the low power of the study. App interventions may require more time to generate beneficial effect in a nonmeditating sample.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a tailored cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) mobile application (app) to treat anxiety in patients with incurable cancer. Materials and Methods: Patients with incurable cancers (n = 145) who reported elevated anxiety symptoms at two cancer centers were randomized to receive either the CBT mobile app for anxiety or a mobile health education program (control) delivered via tablet computers, which patients self‐administered over 12 weeks. To assess anxiety, depression symptoms, and quality of life (QOL), we used the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM‐A, primary outcome), Clinical Global Impression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health Questionnaire‐9, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐General at baseline and 12 weeks. Analysis of covariance models were calculated to assess intervention effects on patient outcomes. Results: Patients (73.8% female; 91.0% white; mean age = 56.45 years, SD = 11.30) in both study groups reported improvements in anxiety, depression symptoms, and QOL from baseline to postassessment, with no significant differences in any outcome measure between groups. Secondary analyses showed that, among the subgroup of patients with severe baseline anxiety, those randomized to the CBT app had greater improvements on the HAM‐A (Mean Difference = 7.44, standard error [SE] = 3.35, p =.037) and HADS‐Anxiety Subscale (Mean Difference = 4.44, SE = 1.60, p =.010) compared with the control group. Conclusion: Both the tailored CBT app for anxiety and the health education program were associated with improvements in anxiety, mood, and QOL, but these outcomes did not differ between study groups. The CBT app was more beneficial than health education for patients with severe baseline anxiety. Implications for Practice: A cognitive‐behavioral therapy mobile application tailored to treat anxiety in patients with advanced cancer helps improve access to evidence‐based supportive care in a convenient, private, and timely manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are increasingly prescribed oral therapies, bearing greater responsibility for self‐management of treatment adherence and adverse events. We conducted a randomized trial to test the use of a smartphone mobile app to improve symptoms and adherence to oral cancer therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 18, 2015, through December 31, 2016, 181 patients with diverse cancers who were prescribed oral therapy were randomized to receive either the smartphone mobile app or standard care. The mobile app included a medication plan with reminders, a symptom‐reporting module, and patient education. Primary outcomes were adherence (per electronic pill caps), symptom burden (per MD Anderson Symptom Inventory), and quality of life (per the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐General). Participants also completed self‐report measures of medication adherence, anxiety and depression symptoms, social support, quality of care, and healthcare utilization. Linear regression was used to assess intervention effects on adherence and change in self‐report outcomes from baseline to week 12, controlling for baseline scores and social support. RESULTS: Study groups did not differ across any outcome measure, with an overall mean adherence of 78.81% (SD, 26.66%) per electronic pill caps. However, moderation analyses showed that intervention effects on the primary adherence measure varied by baseline self‐reported adherence and anxiety symptoms. Specifically, adherence rates per electronic pill caps were higher in patients randomized to the mobile app versus standard care within the subsamples of patients who reported baseline adherence problems (mean difference, ‐22.30%; 95% CI, ‐42.82 to ‐1.78; P=.034) and elevated anxiety (mean difference, ‐16.08%; 95% CI, ‐31.74 to ‐0.41; P=.044). CONCLUSIONS: Although the mobile app may not improve outcomes for all patients prescribed oral cancer therapy, the intervention may be beneficial for those with certain risk factors, such as difficulties with adherence or anxiety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPPs) can delay or prevent progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), few individuals with prediabetes enroll in offered programs. This may be in part because many individuals with prediabetes have low levels of autonomous motivation (ie, motivation that arises from internal sources) to prevent T2DM. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention designed to increase autonomous motivation and healthy behaviors among adults with prediabetes who previously declined participation free DPPs. In addition, the study aims to examine changes in autonomous motivation among adults offered 2 versions of the mHealth program compared with an information‐only control group. METHODS: In this 12‐week, parallel, 3‐arm, mixed‐methods pilot randomized controlled trial, participants were randomized to (1) a group that received information about prediabetes and strategies to prevent T2DM (control); (2) a group that received a mHealth app that aims to increase autonomous motivation among users (app‐only); or (3) a group that received the app plus a physical activity tracker and wireless‐enabled digital scale for self‐monitoring (app‐plus). Primary outcome measures included rates of intervention uptake (number of individuals enrolled/number of individuals assessed for eligibility), retention (number of 12‐week survey completers/number of participants), and adherence (number of device‐usage days). The secondary outcome measure was change in autonomous motivation (measured using the Treatment Self‐Regulation Questionnaire), which was examined using difference‐in‐difference analysis. Furthermore, we conducted postintervention qualitative interviews with participants. RESULTS: Overall, 28% (69/244) of eligible individuals were randomized; of these, 80% (55/69) completed the 12‐week survey. Retention rates were significantly higher among app‐plus participants than participants in the other 2 study arms combined (P=.004, χ2). No significant differences were observed in adherence rates between app‐only and app‐plus participants (43 days vs 37 days; P=.34). Among all participants, mean autonomous motivation measures were relatively high at baseline (6.0 of 7.0 scale), with no statistically significant within‐ or between‐group differences in follow‐up scores. In qualitative interviews (n=15), participants identified reasons that they enjoyed using the app (eg, encouraged self‐reflection), reasons that they did not enjoy using the app (eg, did not consider personal circumstances), and strategies to improve the intervention (eg, increased interpersonal contact). CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with prediabetes who did not engage in free DPPs, this mHealth intervention was feasible and acceptable. Future work should (1) examine the effectiveness of a refined intervention on clinically relevant outcomes (eg, weight loss) among a larger population of DPP nonenrollees with low baseline autonomous motivation and (2) identify other factors associated with DPP nonenrollment, which may serve as additional potential targets for interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data from controlled trials indicate that Web-based interventions generally suffer from low engagement and high attrition. This is important because the level of exposure to intervention content is linked to intervention effectiveness. However, data from real-life Web-based behavior change interventions are scarce, especially when looking at physical activity promotion. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) examine the engagement with the freely available physical activity promotion program 10,000 Steps, (2) examine how the use of a smartphone app may be helpful in increasing engagement with the intervention and in decreasing nonusage attrition, and (3) identify sociodemographic- and engagement-related determinants of nonusage attrition. METHODS: Users (N=16,948) were grouped based on which platform (website, app) they logged their physical activity: Web only, app only, or Web and app. Groups were compared on sociodemographics and engagement parameters (duration of usage, number of individual and workplace challenges started, and number of physical activity log days) using ANOVA and chi-square tests. For a subsample of users that had been members for at least 3 months (n=11,651), Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated to plot attrition over the first 3 months after registration. A Cox regression model was used to determine predictors of nonusage attrition. RESULTS: In the overall sample, user groups differed significantly in all sociodemographics and engagement parameters. Engagement with the program was highest for Web-and-app users. In the subsample, 50.00% (5826/11,651) of users stopped logging physical activity through the program after 30 days. Cox regression showed that user group predicted nonusage attrition: Web-and-app users (hazard ratio=0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.93, P<.001) and app-only users (hazard ratio=0.63, 95% CI 0.58-0.68, P<.001) showed a reduced attrition risk compared to Web-only users. Further, having a higher number of individual challenges (hazard ratio=0.62, 95% CI 0.59-0.66, P<.001), workplace challenges (hazard ratio=0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.97, P<.001), physical activity logging days (hazard ratio=0.921, 95% CI 0.919-0.922, P<.001), and steps logged per day (hazard ratio=0.99999, 95% CI 0.99998-0.99999, P<.001) were associated with reduced nonusage attrition risk as well as older age (hazard ratio=0.992, 95% CI 0.991-0.994, P<.001), being male (hazard ratio=0.85, 95% CI 0.82-0.89, P<.001), and being non-Australian (hazard ratio=0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.91, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other freely accessible Web-based health behavior interventions, the 10,000 Steps program showed high engagement. The use of an app alone or in addition to the website can enhance program engagement and reduce risk of attrition. Better understanding of participant reasons for reducing engagement can assist in clarifying how to best address this issue to maximize behavior change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone use is rapidly growing in developing countries, providing opportunity for development of new health‐based mobile applications. The present study investigated the efficacy of a newly designed mobile application, Smart Glucose Manager (SGM), in Sri Lankan patients with diabetes. METHODS: A total of 67 patients with access to Android smartphones were randomized into an SGM (n = 27) and a control group (n = 25). Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) levels were measured at baseline and every 3 months afterward. The SGM group utilized the application daily, while control‐group patients were instructed to continue their standard methods of diabetes management. Independent t‐tests were utilized to assess A1c differences at 3 and 6 months postrandomization. A1c improvement, defined as A1c at 6 months minus baseline, was compared with SGM usage to assess effectiveness of diabetic management. RESULTS: At the 6‐month follow up, the SGM group had significant lower A1c levels than the control group (7.2% vs 8.17%, P < .0001). For both groups, A1c values decreased from baseline to the 3 months (SGM: 9.52% to 8.16%, P < .0001; control: 9.44% to 8.31%, P < .0001). From 3 months to 6 months, the SGM group showed further improvement of A1c (‐0.96% P < .0001), whereas the control group did not ( P = 0.19). A1c improvement was positively correlated with SGM usage ( R = .81, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The SGM, a mobile application specifically designed to support self‐management of diabetes, appeared to show long‐term improvement of A1c levels in patients with diabetes residing in Sri Lanka.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile Health technology for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation is unknown. METHODS: The simple mobile AF (mAF) App was designed to incorporate clinical decision‐support tools (CHA2DS2‐VASc [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke or TIA, Vascular disease, Age 65‐74 years, Sex category], HAS‐BLED [Hypertension, Abnormal renal/liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/alcohol concomitantly], SAMe‐TT2R2 [Sex, Age <60 years, Medical history, Treatment, Tobacco use, Race] scores), educational materials, and patient involvement strategies with self‐care protocols and structured follow‐up. Patients with atrial fibrillation were randomized into 2 groups (mAF App vs usual care) in a cluster randomized design pilot study. Patients' knowledge, quality of life, drug adherence, and anticoagulation satisfaction were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the mAF App were assessed at 1 month. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were randomized to mAF App intervention (mean age, 67.4 years; 57.5% were male; mean follow‐up, 69 days), and 96 patients were randomized to usual care (mean age, 70.9 years; 55.2% were male; mean follow‐up, 95 days). More than 90% of patients reported that the mAF App was easy, user‐friendly, helpful, and associated with significant improvements in knowledge compared with the usual care arm (P values for trend <.05). Drug adherence and anticoagulant satisfaction were significantly better with the mAF App versus usual care (all P < .05). Quality of life scores were significantly increased in the mAF App arm versus usual care, with anxiety and depression reduced (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The pilot mAFA Trial is the first prospective randomized trial of Mobile Health technology in patients with atrial fibrillation, demonstrating that the mAF App, integrating clinical decision support, education, and patient‐involvement strategies, significantly improved knowledge, drug adherence, quality of life, and anticoagulation satisfaction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth management with an implantable glucose sensor and a mobile application among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was carried out to compare the effectiveness of usual health management to mHealth management based on a model that consisted of the network platform, an implantable glucose sensor and a mobile app featuring guidance from general practitioners (GPs) over a four‐week period. Patients (N=68) with T2DM were randomly divided into an intervention group and a control group. Before the intervention, there was no difference in body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial two‐hour blood glucose (2hPG) and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between the intervention group and the control group (p>0.05). Patients in the control group received their usual health management, while patients in the intervention group received mHealth management. RESULTS: After health management, the mean BMI, FBG, 2hPG and HbA1c of the intervention group patients were all lower than those of the control group patients (p < 0.05), and the quality of life and self‐management of the intervention group patients had significantly improved. DISCUSSION: mHealth management effectively showed significant reductions in BMI, FBG, 2hPG and HbA1c and improved quality of life and self‐management among patients, which may be related to real‐time feedback from an implantable glucose sensor and guidance from GPs through a mobile app. mHealth management is a very promising way to promote the health management of T2DM in China, and this study provides a point of reference for mHealth management abroad.

AB  - Introduction: Physical inactivity has a major negative health effect worldwide. Mobile health apps may help promote active living. This study aimed to examine the effects of a smartphone app based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines and a theory called exercise prescription and education (ERVE as abbreviated in the original Turkish) on physical activity, quality of life, self‐efficacy, and exercise motivation for inactive people. Methods: The study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The 128 participants were randomly allocated to either the experimental group or control group in a 1:1 ratio. Participants in the experimental group received the ERVE smartphone app. No intervention was applied to the participants in the control group. The primary outcomes included self‐efficacy, health‐related quality of life, and motivational orientation for exercise. Secondary outcomes were body mass index (BMI) and levels of physical activity. Results: The per‐protocol analysis revealed that participants in the experimental group reported an increase in behavior initiation, physical functioning, vitality, mental health, general health perception, and intrinsic regulation compared to the control group. Also, the app showed efficacy in reducing the BMI of the participants in the experimental group (p < .05). Conclusions: The ERVE smartphone‐based app seems to be a promising tool to promote physical activity, improve the quality of life, increase self‐efficacy beliefs in the initiation of behaviors, and provide intrinsic motivation in sedentary individuals, at least in the short‐term.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders are not typically offered evidence‐based continuing care, although research suggests that continuing care is associated with better outcomes. A smartphone‐based application could provide effective continuing care. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients leaving residential treatment for alcohol use disorders with a smartphone application to support recovery have fewer risky drinking days than control patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An unmasked randomized clinical trial involving 3 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit treatment organization in the Midwestern United States and 2 residential programs operated by 1 nonprofit organization in the Northeastern United States. In total, 349 patients who met the criteria for DSM‐IV alcohol dependence when they entered residential treatment were randomized to treatment as usual (n = 179) or treatment as usual plus a smartphone (n = 170) with the Addiction‐Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A‐CHESS), an application designed to improve continuing care for alcohol use disorders. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual varied across programs; none offered patients coordinated continuing care after discharge. A‐CHESS provides monitoring, information, communication, and support services to patients, including ways for patients and counselors to stay in contact. The intervention and follow‐up period lasted 8 and 4 months, respectively. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risky drinking days‐‐the number of days during which a patient's drinking in a 2‐hour period exceeded 4 standard drinks for men and 3 standard drinks for women, with standard drink defined as one that contains roughly 14 g of pure alcohol (12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits). Patients were asked to report their risky drinking days in the previous 30 days on surveys taken 4, 8, and 12 months after discharge from residential treatment. RESULTS: For the 8 months of the intervention and 4 months of follow‐up, patients in the A‐CHESS group reported significantly fewer risky drinking days than did patients in the control group, with a mean of 1.39 vs 2.75 days (mean difference, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.46‐2.27; P = .003). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that a multifeatured smartphone application may have significant benefit to patients in continuing care for alcohol use disorders.

AB  - The need for treatment of common mental health problems such as depression or anxiety has steadily increased. However, many people still do not receive effective and timely treatment due to the low availability, accessibility, and acceptability of traditional counseling. In this study, we developed a scalable, effective, and accessible app to address the problems that arise in traditional face-to-face counseling and to treat common psychological problems such as mild depression that people experience in their daily lives. The suggested app features semi-crowdsourced counseling, immediate intervention from multiple counselors, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)-based short comments, and gamification. In a two-week randomized control trial (RCT), we surveyed 47 college students in their 20 s to investigate the efficacy of the suggested app and found that depression levels were reduced significantly only in the experimental group using the app. In addition, we conducted a user survey to determine which design factors affected the user experience of clients and counselors using the app. The proposed app can be used to help those suffering from mild depression in daily life, and it can also be used as a training aid to enhance counselors' counseling skills.

AB  - Objective: The objectives of this pilot study were (1) to assess the feasibility of a larger evaluation of Smart About Meds (SAM), a patient-centered medication management mobile application, and (2) to evaluate SAM's potential to improve outcomes of interest, including adherence to medication changes made at hospital discharge and the occurrence of adverse events. Materials and Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial among patients discharged from internal medicine units of an academic health center between June 2019 and March 2020. Block randomization was used to randomize patients to intervention (received access to SAM at discharge) or control (received usual care). Patients were followed for 30 days post-discharge, during which app use was recorded. Pharmacy claims data were used to measure adherence to medication changes made at discharge, and physician billing data were used to identify emergency department visits and hospital readmissions during follow-up. Results: Forty-nine patients were eligible for inclusion in the study at hospital discharge (23 intervention, 26 control). In the 30 days of post-discharge, 15 (65.2%) intervention patients used the SAM app. During this period, intervention patients adhered to a larger proportion of medication changes (83.7%) than control patients (77.8%), including newly prescribed medications (72.7% vs 61.7%) and dose changes (90.9% vs 81.8%). A smaller proportion of intervention patients (8.7%) were readmitted to hospital during follow-up than control patients (15.4%). Conclusion: The high uptake of SAM among intervention patients supports the feasibility of a larger trial. Results also suggest that SAM has the potential to enhance adherence to medication changes and reduce the risk of downstream adverse events. This hypothesis needs to be tested in a larger trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is the most prevalent and most preventable cancer in Australia. Despite Australia's long-running public health campaigns, young Australian adults continue to report high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and frequent sunburns. Young people are now increasingly turning away from traditional media, such as newspapers and TV, favoring Web-based streaming, which is challenging the health care sector to develop new ways to reach this group with targeted, personalized health promotion messages. Advances in technology have enabled delivery of time- and context-relevant health interventions. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to test the effect of UVR feedback from a smartphone app or a UVR dosimeter feedback device on sun protection habits, sun exposure behaviors, sunburn, and physical activity levels in young adults. METHODS: Young adults aged 18-35 years (n=124) were recruited from Queensland, Australia, between September 2015 and April 2016, via social or traditional media campaigns and outreach activities in the local community. Participants were randomized into 3 groups for a 4-week intervention: (1) no intervention control group; (2) UVR monitor group, who were asked to wear a UVR dosimeter feedback device set to their skin type; and (3) a SunSmart app group, who were asked to download and use the SunSmart phone app. Data were self-assessed through Web-based surveys at baseline and 1 week and 3 months postintervention. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 86.2% (107/124) of participants (control group, n=36; UVR monitor group, n=36; and SunSmart app group, n=35). Intervention uptake in the UVR monitor group was high, with 94% (34/36) of participants using the device all or some of the time when outdoors. All SunSmart app group participants downloaded the app on their smartphone. There was no significant difference in the change in the sun protection habits (SPH) index (main outcome measure) across the 3 groups. However, compared with the control group, a significantly greater proportion of the participants in the UVR monitor group reduced their time unprotected and exposed to UVR on weekends during the intervention compared with the baseline (odds ratio [OR]: 2.706, 95% CI 1.047-6.992, P=.04). This significant effect was sustained with greater reductions observed up to 3 months postintervention (OR: 3.130, 95% CI 1.196-8.190, P=.02). There were no significant differences between the groups in weekday sun exposure, sunscreen use, sunburn, suntan, or physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Using technology such as apps and personal UVR monitoring devices may improve some sun exposure behaviors among young adults, but as the SPH index did not increase in this study, further research is required to achieve consistent uptake of sun protection in young people.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) experience disease‐related barriers to physical training. Compared with the general population, IRD patients are reported to have reduced maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and physical activity levels. Supervised high‐intensity interval training (HIIT) is documented to counteract the reduced VO2max and poor cardiovascular health associated with IRDs. However, supervised HIIT is resource demanding. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate if self‐administered 4×4‐min HIIT guided by a smartphone app (Myworkout GO) could yield similar HIIT‐induced effects as standard 4×4‐min HIIT performed under the guidance and supervision of health care professionals. The effects studied were on VO2max and health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). METHODS: Forty patients (33 female patients, mean age 48 years, SD 12 years; 7 male patients, mean age 52 years, SD 11 years) diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus were randomized to a supervised group (SG) or an app group (AG). Both groups were instructed to perform 4×4‐min intervals with a rate of perceived exertion of 16 to 17, corresponding to 85% to 95% of the maximal heart rate, twice a week for 10 weeks. Treadmill VO2max and HRQoL measured using RAND‐36 were assessed before and after the exercise period. RESULTS: VO2max increased (P<.001) in both groups after 10 weeks of HIIT, with improvements of 3.6 (SD 1.3) mL/kg/min in the SG and 3.7 (SD 1.5) mL/kg/min in the AG. This was accompanied by increases in oxygen pulse in both groups (P<.001), with no between‐group differences apparent for either measure. Improvements in the HRQoL dimensions of bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning were observed for both groups (P<.001 to P=.04). Again, no between‐group differences were detected. CONCLUSIONS: High‐intensity 4×4‐min interval training increased VO2max and HRQoL, contributing to patients' reduced cardiovascular disease risk, improved health and performance, and enhanced quality of life. Similar improvements were observed following HIIT when IRD patients were guided using perceived exertion by health care professionals or the training was self‐administered and guided by the app Myworkout GO. Utilization of the app may help reduce the cost of HIIT as a treatment strategy in this patient population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Strong positive relationships between dietary self‐monitoring and eating disorder risk are seen in population‐based, observational studies. However, current evidence cannot establish causality. Furthermore, little is known about other mental and behavioral health consequences of dietary self‐monitoring among college women, a population vulnerable to eating disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine if introducing dietary self‐monitoring via a popular smartphone app to undergraduate women impacts eating disorder risk, other aspects of mental health, or health behaviors including dietary intake and physical activity. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: Undergraduate women who had not engaged in dietary self‐monitoring in the past year and who were at low‐risk for an eating disorder participated between May and October 2019 (n�= 200). INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to engage in dietary self‐monitoring via MyFitnessPal for approximately 1 month or to receive no intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self‐report data on eating disorder risk, other mental health outcomes, and health behaviors were collected at baseline and post‐intervention. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Linear and logistic regressions were utilized to test hypotheses. RESULTS: Adherence to the intervention was high, with participants recording their dietary intake via MyFitnessPal on average 89.1% of days between baseline and post‐intervention. Assignment to the intervention was not associated with changes in eating disorder risk, anxiety, depressive symptoms, body satisfaction, quality of life, nutritional intake, physical activity, screen time, or other forms of weight‐related self‐monitoring (all P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Among dietary self‐monitoring naive undergraduate women with low‐risk of an eating disorder, dietary self‐monitoring via MyFitnessPal for 1 month did not increase eating disorder risk, impact other aspects of mental health, or alter health behaviors including dietary intake. The null results in our study may be due to the selection of a low‐risk sample; future research should explore whether there are populations for whom dietary self‐monitoring is contraindicated.

AB  - Objective To test the efficacy of a weight loss mobile app based on recommender systems and developed by experts in health promotion and computer science to target social support and self‐monitoring of diet, physical activity (PA), and weight (Social POD app), compared to a commercially available diet and PA tracking app (standard). Materials and methods Overweight adults [N = 51] were recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental group [n = 26; theory‐based podcasts (TBP) + Social POD app] or the comparison group (n = 25; TBP + standard app). The Social POD app issued notifications to encourage users to self‐monitor and send theory‐based messages to support users who had not self‐monitored in the previous 48 h. Independent samples t‐test were used to examine group differences in kilograms lost and change in BMI. Analysis of covariance was used to analyze secondary outcomes while controlling for baseline values. Results Participant attrition was 12% (n = 3 experimental and n = 3 comparison). Experimental group participants lost significantly more weight (‐5.3 kg, CI: ‐7.5, ‐3.0) than comparison group (‐2.23 kg, CI: ‐3.6, ‐1.0; d = 0.8, r = 0.4, p = 0.02) and had a greater reduction in BMI (p = 0.02). While there were significant differences in positive outcome expectations between groups (p = 0.04) other secondary outcomes (e.g., caloric intake and social support) were not significant. Discussion Use of the Social POD app resulted in significantly greater weight loss than use of a commercially available tracking app. This mobile health intervention has the potential to be widely disseminated to reduce the risk of chronic disease associated with overweight and obesity.

AB  - Currently about 71% of adults in the US are considered overweight or obese. Overweight and obesity are associated with higher risk of developing many chronic diseases; however, health risks associated with overweight and obesity can be reduced by as little as a 3% to 5% reduction in weight. Mobile health (mHealth) has shown promise as a way to deliver weight loss interventions, yet maintaining participant engagement over time has been a challenge. The purpose of this study was to develop, refine, and pilot test the Social Pounds Off Digitally (POD) Android app for personalized health monitoring and interaction; revise the Social POD app based on participant feedback; and conduct a multi-site randomized clinical trial to pilot test the second iteration of the Social POD app. Overweight and obese adults with Android smartphones (BMI 25-49.9 kg/m2; N=9) were recruited for a two-month weight loss pilot intervention and iterative usability testing of the Social POD app. The app prompted participants via notification to track daily weight, diet, and PA behaviors. Participants received the content of the behavioral weight loss intervention via podcast. In order to re-engage infrequent users, the app prompted frequent app users to select one of three messages to send to infrequent users targeting one of three behavioral theory constructs: 1) social support, 2) self-efficacy, or 3) negative outcome expectations. Body weight and dietary intake (two 24-hr recalls) were assessed at baseline and two months. All participants attended one of two focus groups to provide feedback on use of the app. Based on the usability testing, the Social POD app was refined and a point-based incentive system was incorporated into the app and used in a larger randomized controlled trial. Overweight and obese adults (N=51, mean BMI=34.7 +/- 6.0, 38% black) in Charleston and Columbia, SC who owned an Android phone or tablet were recruited to participate in a 12-week behavioral weight loss intervention delivered via mobile app and podcast. All participants received the behavioral content of the weight loss intervention via twice weekly podcasts and were randomized to download and use either a standard calorie tracking app (Fat Secret) or the Social POD app. Main outcomes included kilograms lost at 12-weeks and secondary outcomes included change in psychosocial variable scores from pre- to post-test, association between points earned and percent weight loss at 12-weeks, and re-engagement based on message-type received. Following the usability testing participants lost a mean of -0.94 kg (+/-2.22 kg, p=0.24) and consumed significantly fewer kcals post-intervention (1570+/-508 kcal/day) as compared to baseline (2384+/-993 kcal/day, p=0.01). Mean number of app entries was 77.2 +/- 73.8 per person with a range of 2 to 219. Messages selected and sent to infrequent users targeting social support were sent most frequently (n=32, 46%), followed by self-efficacy (n=29, 40%), and negative outcome expectations (n=10, 14%). Themes from the focus groups included functionality issues, revisions to the messaging system, and the addition of a point system with rewards for achieving goals. Participant attrition for the RCT was 12% (n=3 experimental and n=3 comparison). Experimental group participants lost significantly more weight (-5.3kg, CI: -7.5, -3.0) than comparison group participants (-2.23kg, CI: -3.6, -1.0; p=0.02) and had a greater reduction in BMI (p=0.02). These outcomes were significant for both intention-to-treat (using baseline observation carried forward) and complete case. While there were significant differences in final positive outcome expectations scores between groups [4.56 experimental, 3.57 comparison (scale range from 1 to 7, maximum); p=0.04], other secondary outcomes (e.g., caloric intake and social support) were not significantly different by group assignment.

AB  - Mobile mindfulness interventions represent a promising alternative to traditional in-person interventions that are resource demanding and have limited accessibility, preventing use by many populations. Despite greater accessibility and popularity of mobile mindfulness applications (apps), research is needed testing the effectiveness of brief interventions delivered via these platforms. The present study assessed the efficacy of a brief mobile mindfulness intervention compared to an active control for increasing state and trait mindfulness and improving mood, as well as the acceptability of the app, in a sample of undergraduate students. Participants (N=139; M <sub>age</sub>=19.43years, 80.6% female, 83.5% White) were randomly assigned to either a 10-day mobile mindfulness (Headspace) or cognitive training (Peak) condition. Trait mindfulness was measured pre- and post-intervention. During the 10-day intervention, participants completed 10-min daily exercises on the assigned app, responded to daily questionnaires of state mindfulness and mood, and completed a daily written log of their reactions to the app exercises. Attrition was low (90% completion rate) and did not differ by condition. Participants in the mindfulness condition spent an average of 88.15min (SD=24.75) meditating out of the full 100min prescribed by the intervention. State mindfulness significantly increased across the 10-day intervention for participants in the mindfulness, but not the cognitive training, condition beginning around days 5 and 6. Some aspects of trait mindfulness increased and mood improved from pre- to post-intervention, but these changes were observed in both conditions (i.e., no significant differences were observed by condition). Qualitative analysis of open-ended reactions to the mindfulness app indicated that participants reported more likes than dislikes. Common themes for likes were that participants experienced feelings of calm and focus following the daily mindfulness exercises. Dislikes included discomfort and anxiety associated with increased awareness of thoughts and physical sensations. These findings suggest that while a brief mobile mindfulness intervention is acceptable to undergraduate college students and effective at increasing state mindfulness, a longer intervention may be needed in order to elicit corresponding changes in trait-level mindfulness or mood.

AB  - Cancer patients experience various psychological and social difficulties, the most common being depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an app-based cognitive behavioral therapy program for depression and anxiety in cancer patients. For this purpose, 63 participants who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday), a simple information-provision mobile-application-based program (HARUCard), or a waitlist control group. Self-report questionnaires including the Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Health-Related Quality of Life Scale, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and two computer tasks including the dot-probe task and the Implicit Association Test, were administered before and after 66 days of intervention. The results showed that the Beck Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores of the cognitive behavioral therapy program (HARUToday) group decreased significantly after the intervention compared to the attention control (HARUCard) and waitlist control groups. However, there were no significant changes in scores of the Health-Related Quality of Life Scale and Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, and the two computer tasks. Such results suggest that a mobile-application-based cognitive behavioral therapy program may be an effective intervention for alleviating depression and anxiety, but not the general quality of life of cancer patients. Taking into consideration that psychosocial problems may not the topmost priority for cancer patients who are facing a chronic and possibly mortal disease, a mobile-application cognitive behavioral therapy program may be a possible solution for the alleviation of depression and anxiety in cancer patients who have many restraints in terms of time and space.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) and secondary prevention are effective components of evidence-based management for cardiac patients, resulting in improved clinical and behavioural outcomes. Mobile health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing health delivery method that has the potential to enhance CR and heart failure management. We undertook a systematic review to assess the evidence around mHealth interventions for CR and heart failure management for service and patient outcomes, cost effectiveness with a view to how mHealth could be utilized for rural, remote and Indigenous cardiac patients. METHODS: A comprehensive search of databases using key terms was conducted for the years 2000 to August 2016 to identify randomised and non-randomised trials utilizing smartphone functionality and a model of care that included CR and heart failure management. Included studies were assessed for quality and risk of bias and data extraction was undertaken by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Nine studies described a mix of mHealth interventions for CR (5 studies) and heart failure (4 studies) in the following categories: feasibility, utility and uptake studies; and randomised controlled trials. Studies showed that mHealth delivery for CR and heart failure management is feasible with high rates of participant engagement, acceptance, usage, and adherence. Moreover, mHealth delivery of CR was as effective as traditional centre-based CR (TCR) with significant improvement in quality of life. Hospital utilization for heart failure patients showed inconsistent reductions. There was limited inclusion of rural participants. CONCLUSION: Mobile health delivery has the potential to improve access to CR and heart failure management for patients unable to attend TCR programs. Feasibility testing of culturally appropriate mHealth delivery for CR and heart failure management is required in rural and remote settings with subsequent implementation and evaluation into local health care services.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine if medication reminding via smartphone app increases adherence to antidepressant medications in college students. PARTICIPANTS: College students (N = 57) enrolled at a state-funded institution who had a current prescription for an antidepressant and regularly used a smartphone device. METHODS: Participants were randomized to either a reminder group or a control group. Both groups were asked to complete a survey and undergo a manual pill count at the beginning of the study and 30 days later. RESULTS: There was a strong trend suggesting that the use of a medication reminder app was beneficial for adherence to antidepressant medication regimens. Factors influencing medication adherence in college students included health beliefs, use of illicit drugs, and type of professional care received. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a medication reminder may increase adherence to antidepressant medications in college students.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of mobile health applications in changing health-related behaviors and clinical health outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in this study. We conducted a comprehensive bibliographic search of articles on health behavior changes related to the use of mobile health applications in peer-reviewed journals published between January 1, 2000 and May 31, 2017. We used databases including CHINAHL, Ovid-Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed. The risk of bias assessment of the retrieved articles was examined using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. RESULTS: A total of 20 articles met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen among 20 studies reported that applications have a positive impact on the targeted health behaviors or clinical health outcomes. In addition, most of the studies, which examined the satisfaction of participants, showed health app users have a statistically significant higher satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high risk of bias, such as selection, performance, and detection, this systematic review found that the use of mobile health applications has a positive impact on health-related behaviors and clinical health outcomes. Application users were more satisfied with using mobile health applications to manage their health in comparison to users of conventional care.

AB  - Background Nonadherence to immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation is associated with poor graft outcomes. We aimed to evaluate whether the use of the Adhere4U mobile medication manager application could improve adherence among renal transplant recipients â‰¥1 year posttransplantation. Adhere4U can provide medication reminders, monitor medication use, and provide information on immunosuppressants. Methods We conducted a prospective randomized controlled study to compare the rate of nonadherence to index immunosuppressant (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) in a group using the Adhere4U app (mobile group) and in another group receiving conventional care (control group). The primary outcome was the nonadherence rate, which was evaluated using an electronic medication event monitoring system during the 6‐month intervention period. Our secondary outcome included self‐reported adherence using the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medication Scale (BAASIS) and the visual analog scale (VAS) based on a 4‐week recall on days 28, 90, and 180. Longitudinal data of repeated measures of self‐rated adherence were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to compare the between‐group difference in adherence change over time. Results Between November 2013 and May 2015, 138 renal transplant recipients were randomly allocated to the control (n = 67) or the mobile group (n = 71). The overall nonadherence rate over the 6‐month study period by electronic monitoring was 63.6%, with no between‐group difference [mobile group, 65.0% (n = 39/60); control group, 62.1% (n = 36/58); odds ratio 1.14; 95% confidence interval 0.53â€“2.40; p = 0.89]. Self‐rated nonadherence assessed using the BAASIS and VAS at baseline was 53.7% and 51.5%, respectively. Although the self‐rated nonadherence by BAASIS of the mobile group was lower than the control group throughout the study period, there was no between‐group difference in the change of nonadherence over time (Ï‡2 = 2.82, df = 3, p = 0.42 by logistic GEE). There also was no significant between‐group difference in the nonadherence by VAS (Ï‡2 = 1.71, df = 3, p = 0.63 by logistic GEE) over time. The main limitation of this study was the low rate of patient engagement with the app among the mobile group. The rate of app use was 47.6% (31/65) at 28 days, 33.9% (19/56) at 90 days, and 11.5% (6/52) at 180 days. Conclusions The Adhere4U application did not improve adherence to immunosuppressive therapy. Our evidence is limited by the high rate of attrition. Further studies on strategies to facilitate patient engagement with mobile interventions are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mobile applications (apps) facilitate aspects of people's lives and are useful auxiliary tools for controlling risk factors for chronic diseases. This meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to explore the effect of app-assisted interventions on blood pressure (BP) control in Chinese adults and summarize the common functions of these apps. STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The search was conducted in four databases (PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, and China Biology Medicine database). The identified articles were reviewed independently by two researchers. A random-effects model was used to compute the effect size. Studies were assessed for risk of bias and the transparency and quality of the apps. RESULTS: Eighteen studies (n = 2965) were included in the final analysis. App-based interventions achieved additional decreases in BP levels (systolic BP [SBP]: -8.12 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -11.47 to -4.77 mmHg, P < 0.001; diastolic BP [DBP]: -6.67 mmHg, 95% CI: -8.92 to -4.41 mmHg, P < 0.001). However, the results showed considerable heterogeneity (SBP: I2 = 97%, P < 0.001; DBP: I2 = 96%, P < 0.001). Four studies reported the BP control rate. The pooled results demonstrated a better control rate achieved via app-based interventions (risk ratio: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.49, P < 0.001) without heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). The transparency and replicability assessment revealed unsatisfying results, and only three studies reported more than half of the 16 items in the mHealth checklist. Few studies described the replicability, data security, and infrastructure of the apps used. We identified 16 app functions, with the top three functions being doctor-patient communication (16/16), health education (15/16), and personalized guidance (12/16). CONCLUSIONS: We showed app-based interventions had a positive effect on BP management in Chinese adults. However, there was high heterogeneity among the included studies, which merits further exploration when more standardized research has been conducted. The functions of the apps varied widely, and further development of apps for BP management should abide by appropriate reporting guidelines.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effects of a symptom management intervention (SMI) based on symptom management group sessions combined with a mobile health (mHealth) application (app) on the knowledge of symptom management, the certainty of symptom self‐management, symptom severity, symptom distress, medication adherence, social support, and quality of life among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in China. Methods: A parallel randomized controlled trial with 61 PLWH was conducted in Shanghai, China. The participants in the control group (n = 30) downloaded the Symptom Management (SM) app according to their needs and preferences, and received routine follow‐ups. The participants in the intervention group (n = 31) were guided to download and use the SM app, and received four tailored weekly group sessions at routine follow‐ups. Each group session lasted for approximately 2 h and targeted one of the major modules of the SM app. All the outcomes were assessed at baseline and post‐intervention. The study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900024821). Results: The symptom management knowledge and certainty of symptom self‐management were significantly improved after the intervention (all P < 0.01). Compared with the control group, the scores of symptoms reasons knowledge score improved 11.47 points (95% CI: 3.41, 19.53) and scores of symptoms self‐management knowledge score improved 12.80 points (95% CI: 4.55, 21.05) in the intervention group after controlling for covariates. However, other outcomes did not show statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The SMI could improve PLWH's symptom management knowledge and certainty of symptom self‐management. Multi‐center studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow‐ups are needed to further understand the effects of SM app on ameliorating symptom severity and symptom distress. More innovative strategies are also needed to promote and maintain the sustainability of the SM app.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Outpatients undergoing cancer chemotherapy experience anxiety related to adverse drug reactions that they can experience at home. We developed a breast cancer patient support system (BPSS) application (app). The BPSS app chronologically and quantitatively records patients' subjective and objective symptoms during breast cancer chemotherapy, with the goal of providing supportive management for adverse drug reactions. The present study examined whether the BPSS app is an effective tool for supporting patients undergoing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 102 patients undergoing chemotherapy at the Showa University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) were enrolled in the present order‐ and age‐controlled clinical trial and randomized into BPSS or no‐BPSS app groups. The patients underwent 4 courses of chemotherapy. The primary outcome was the change in the hospital anxiety and depression scale score, which was assessed directly before and after the 4 courses of chemotherapy. Other outcomes included health literacy (measured using the 14‐item health literacy scale (HLS‐14), side effects, and app adherence. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients, 95 completed the present study. No significant improvement was seen in anxiety, depression, or health literacy at the end of treatment between the BPSS and no‐BPSS app groups. Overall, 1868 side effects were reported. When the patients' records were compared with the medical staff records, the analysis revealed that the medical staff had underestimated some grade 3 symptoms. CONCLUSION: The BPSS app is a feasible tool for patients with breast cancer and might be useful as a support tool for information sharing between patients and medical staff in an effort to optimize chemotherapy and deliver suitable patient care and support.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective randomized‐controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate if an app‐based feedback‐controlled active muscle training programme can be used to improve the outcome in the immediate postoperative period after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: Sixty patients, with a median age of 65.9 years (range 45‐84), awaiting primary TKA were randomized into a control and training group. Both groups followed an identical postoperative protocol. In addition, the training group postoperatively performed an app‐based feedback‐controlled active muscle training programme multiple times daily. Outcome measures were active and passive range of motion (ROM), pain at rest and in motion, knee extension strength, the timed "Up and Go", 10‐m Walk Test, 30‐s Chair Stand Test, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS), and clinical data. RESULTS: The training group performed an average of 18.4 training sessions, which led to significantly higher ROM, less pain at rest and in motion, higher strength, and significantly higher functional scores. More training correlated with a better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The use of an app‐based feedback‐controlled active muscle training programme can improve the clinical outcome after TKA, especially ROM and reduce pain. Clinically relevant is that the training programme could be considered an alternative to continuous passive motion after total knee arthroplasty. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are highly prevalent among college students. Most students with poor mental health, however, do not receive professional help. Internet‐based self‐help formats may increase the utilization of treatment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy of an internet‐based, app‐supported stress management intervention for college students. METHODS: College students (n=150) with elevated levels of stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4‐item version, PSS‐4 ≥8) were randomly assigned to either an internet‐ and mobile‐based stress intervention group with feedback on demand or a waitlist control group. Self‐report data were assessed at baseline, posttreatment (7 weeks), and 3‐month follow‐up. The primary outcome was perceived stress posttreatment (PSS‐4). Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk and protective factors, and college‐related outcomes. Subgroup analyses were conducted in students with clinically relevant symptoms of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale >17). RESULTS: A total of 106 participants (76.8%) indicated that they were first‐time help‐seekers, and 77.3% (intervention group: 58/75; waitlist control group: 58/75) showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline. Findings indicated significant effects of the intervention compared with the waitlist control group for stress (d=0.69; 95% CI 0.36‐1.02), anxiety (d=0.76; 95% CI 0.43‐1.09), depression (d=0.63; 95% CI 0.30‐0.96), college‐related productivity (d=0.33; 95% CI 0.01‐0.65), academic work impairment (d=0.34; 95% CI 0.01‐0.66), and other outcomes after 7 weeks (posttreatment). Response rates for stress symptoms were significantly higher for the intervention group (69%, 52/75) compared with the waitlist control group (35%, 26/75, P<.001; number needed to treat=2.89, 95% CI 2.01‐5.08) at posttest (7 weeks). Effects were sustained at 3‐month follow‐up, and similar findings emerged in students with symptoms of depression. CONCLUSIONS: Internet‐ and mobile‐based interventions could be an effective and cost‐effective approach to reduce consequences of college‐related stress and might potentially attract students with clinically relevant depression who would not otherwise seek help.

AB  - Depression is highly prevalent among university students. Internet‐based interventions have been found to be effective in addressing depressive symptoms, but it is open if this also applies to interventions directed at academic stress. It is also largely unclear if the techniques employed in such programs provide significant additional benefits when controlling for non‐specific intervention effects. A sample of N = 200 students with elevated levels of depression (CES‐D ≥ 16) of a large distance‐learning university were randomly assigned to either an Internet‐ and App‐based stress intervention group (IG; n = 100) or an active control group (CG; n = 100) receiving an Internet‐based psychoeducational program of equal length. Self‐report data was assessed at baseline, post‐treatment (7 weeks) and three‐month follow‐up. The primary outcome was depression (CES‐D) post‐treatment. Secondary outcomes included mental health outcomes, modifiable risk factors, and academic outcomes. We found significant between‐group effects on depressive symptom severity (d = 0.36; 95% CI: 0.08–0.64), as well as behavioral activation (d = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.30–0.91), perceived stress (d = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.18–0.73), anxiety (d = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.03–0.67) and other secondary outcomes post‐treatment. Effects on depression were sustained at three‐month follow‐up. Response rates for depressive symptoms were significantly higher in the IG (26%) than the CG (14%) at post‐test (χ2=4.5, p = 0.04), but not at three‐month follow‐up (p = 0.454). We also found significant effects on relevant academic outcomes, including work impairment (follow‐up; d = 0.36), work output (post‐treatment; d = 0.27) and work cutback (follow‐up; d = 0.36). The intervention was more effective for depressive symptoms compared to the CG, and so controlling for unspecific intervention effects. This suggests that specific techniques of the intervention may provide significant additional benefits on depressive symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones are ideal for promoting physical activity in those with little intrinsic motivation for exercise. This study tested three hypotheses: H1 ‐ receipt of social feedback generates higher step‐counts than receipt of no feedback; H2 ‐ receipt of social feedback generates higher step‐counts than only receiving feedback on one's own walking; H3 ‐ receipt of feedback on one's own walking generates higher step‐counts than no feedback (H3). METHODS: A parallel group randomised controlled trial measured the impact of feedback on steps‐counts. Healthy male participants (n = 165) aged 18‐40 were given phones pre‐installed with an app that recorded steps continuously, without the need for user activation. Participants carried these with them as their main phones for a two‐week run‐in and six‐week trial. Randomisation was to three groups: no feedback (control); personal feedback on step‐counts; group feedback comparing step‐counts against those taken by others in their group. The primary outcome measure, steps per day, was assessed using longitudinal multilevel regression analysis. Control variables included attitude to physical activity and perceived barriers to physical activity. RESULTS: Fifty‐five participants were allocated to each group; 152 completed the study and were included in the analysis: n = 49, no feedback; n = 53, individual feedback; n = 50, individual and social feedback. The study provided support for H1 and H3 but not H2. Receipt of either form of feedback explained 7.7 % of between‐subject variability in step‐count (F = 6.626, p < 0.0005). Compared to the control, the expected step‐count for the individual feedback group was 60 % higher (effect on log step‐count = 0.474, 95 % CI = 0.166‐0.782) and that for the social feedback group, 69 % higher (effect on log step‐count = 0.526, 95 % CI = 0.212‐0.840). The difference between the two feedback groups (individual vs social feedback) was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Always‐on smartphone apps that provide step‐counts can increase physical activity in young to early‐middle‐aged men but the provision of social feedback has no apparent incremental impact. This approach may be particularly suitable for inactive people with low levels of physical activity; it should now be tested with this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health education and behavior change programs targeting specific risk factors have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing the development of future diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) shares many of the same risk factors, most of which can be addressed via behavior change. It is therefore theorized that a behavior change intervention targeting these risk factors would likely result in favorable rates of AD prevention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to reduce the future risk of developing AD, while in the short term promoting vascular health, through behavior change. METHODS: The study was an interventional randomized controlled trial consisting of subjects who were randomly assigned into either treatment (n=102) or control group (n=42). Outcome measures included various blood‐based biomarkers, anthropometric measures, and behaviors related to AD risk. The treatment group was provided with a bespoke "Gray Matters" mobile phone app designed to encourage and facilitate behavior change. The app presented evidence‐based educational material relating to AD risk and prevention strategies, facilitated self‐reporting of behaviors across 6 behavioral domains, and presented feedback on the user's performance, calculated from reported behaviors against recommended guidelines. RESULTS: This paper explores the rationale for a mobile phone‐led intervention and details the app's effect on behavior change and subsequent clinical outcomes. Via the app, the average participant submitted 7.3 (SD 3.2) behavioral logs/day (n=122,719). Analysis of these logs against primary outcome measures revealed that participants who improved their high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during the study duration answered a statistically significant higher number of questions per day (mean 8.30, SD 2.29) than those with no improvement (mean 6.52, SD 3.612), t97.74=‐3.051, P=.003. Participants who decreased their body mass index (BMI) performed significantly better in attaining their recommended daily goals (mean 56.21 SD 30.4%) than those who increased their BMI (mean 40.12 SD 29.1%), t80 = ‐2.449, P=.017. In total, 69.2% (n=18) of those who achieved a mean performance percentage of 60% or higher, across all domains, reduced their BMI during the study, whereas 60.7% (n=34) who did not, increased their BMI. One‐way analysis of variance of systolic blood pressure category changes showed a significant correlation between reported efforts to reduce stress and category change as a whole, P=.035. An exit survey highlighted that respondents (n=83) reported that the app motivated them to perform physical activity (85.4%) and make healthier food choices (87.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the ubiquitous nature of the mobile phone excelled as a delivery platform for the intervention, enabling the dissemination of educational intervention material while simultaneously monitoring and encouraging positive behavior change, resulting in desirable clinical effects. Sustained effort to maintain the achieved behaviors is expected to mitigate future AD risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While gains in reducing smoking rates in Finland have been made, prevalence rates are still substantial. Relapse rates among smokers engaged in quit‐smoking programs are high. Physical activity has been proposed as one means to help smokers manage cravings. Software and apps on mobile phone and handheld devices offer an opportunity to communicate messages on how to use physical activity to manage cravings as part of quit‐smoking programs. // OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mobile phone app, Physical activity over Smoking (PhoS), to assist smokers in quitting smoking in a randomized controlled trial. The app was designed to prompt smokers to engage in physical activities to manage their smoking cravings. // METHODS: Regular smokers (n=44) attended a group‐based behavioral counselling program aimed at promoting physical activity as an additional aid to quit. After quit day, participants were randomly allocated to an intervention (n=25) or to a comparison (n=19) group. Participants in the intervention group were provided with the PhoS app and training on how to use it to assist with relapse prevention. Participants in the comparison condition were provided with generalized relapse prevention training. // RESULTS: Some participants reported that the PhoS app was useful in assisting them to successfully manage their cigarette cravings, although compliance across the sample was modest and participants reported low levels of usability. Participants receiving the PhoS app did not report greater abstinence than those who did not receive the app. However, participants receiving the app were more likely to report greater abstinence if they did not use pharmacological support, while those who did not receive the app reported greater abstinence when using pharmacological support. Participants receiving the app reported greater levels of physical activity than those who did not. Results revealed that the app resulted in better retention. // CONCLUSIONS: The PhoS app showed some potential to reduce abstinence among participants not using pharmacological therapy and to increase physical activity. However, problems with usability and lack of effects on abstinence raise questions over the app's long‐term effectiveness. Future research should prioritize further development of the app to maximize usability and test effects of the intervention independent of quit‐smoking programs. // TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN): 55259451; http://www.controlled‐trials.com/ISRCTN55259451 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/6cKF2mzEI).

AB  - Purpose: Patients report wanting more information about psoriasis and clear expectations from the onset of therapy. Dermatologists do not think patients receive or internalize adequate information. There is a need for further explanation of treatment regimens to increase knowledge, compliance, and patient satisfaction. Recent advancements in web technology have the potential to improve these psoriasis outcomes. Methods: A web based application was created to educate psoriasis patients using video, graphics, and textual information. An investigator blinded, randomized, controlled study evaluated the website's efficacy in 50 psoriasis patients at Wake Forest Baptist Health Dermatology. Patients were randomized into two groups: Group 1 received a link to the educational web app and a survey following their visit; Group 2 received a link to the survey with no educational web app. The survey assessed patient knowledge, self‐reported adherence to medication, and adequacy of addressing concerns. Twenty two patients completed the study. Results: Patients in the web app group scored an average of 11/14 on the psoriasis knowledge quiz, whereas patients in the control group scored an average of 9/14 for an improvement of roughly 18% (p=0.008, n=22). Conclusion: Web app based education via DermPatientEd.Com is an efficient way to improve knowledge, but we did not demonstrate improvements in self‐reported medication adherence or the ability to address concerns of psoriasis patients.

AB  - AIMS: To synthesize evidences on smartphone application-based intervention and determine its effectiveness on glycaemic control, self-management behaviours, psychological well-being, quality of life and cardiometabolic risk factors. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES: Major English and Chinese electronic databases were searched from January 2008 to January 2021, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Google Scholar, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang and Sinomed. REVIEW METHODS: RCTs were screened and selected if they used smartphone applications to support patients in the self-management of diabetes. Data extraction and methodological assessment were performed by two reviewers independently. Meta-analysis was performed to pool the intervention effect on outcomes of interest using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Across 19 included trials involving 2585 participants, smartphone application-based interventions were associated with a clinically and statistically significant reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Beneficial effects were also observed in participants' behavioural performance, especially in medication adherence. Intervention effects on psychological status, quality of life and cardiometabolic risk factors were nonsignificant. Subgroup analysis showed interactive approach with medium frequency or flexible facilitator-patient interaction induced a larger effect on HbA1c reduction. Besides, patients with baseline HbA1c ≥9% benefited more than those with HbA1c <9% from the use of smartphone applications. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone application-based diabetes self-management intervention could optimize patients' glycaemic control and enhance participants' self-management performance. Further endeavour is required to examine the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of smartphone application-based intervention before promoting the adoption and dissemination of such intervention. IMPACT: This review supports the potential of smartphone application-based intervention as effective approach to optimize glycaemic control and promote self-management engagement among patients with type 2 diabetes. Suggestions for future research and practice are provided and discussed.

AB  - Background: Smartphone apps for smoking cessation could offer easily accessible, highly tailored, intensive interventions at a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling. Although there are hundreds of publicly available smoking cessation apps, few have been empirically evaluated using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. The Smart‐Treatment (Smart‐T2) app is a just‐in‐time adaptive intervention that uses ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) to assess the risk for imminent smoking lapse and tailors treatment messages based on the risk of lapse and reported symptoms. Objective: This 3‐armed pilot RCT aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an automated smartphone‐based smoking cessation intervention (Smart‐T2) relative to standard in‐person smoking cessation clinic care and the National Cancer Institute’s free smoking cessation app, QuitGuide. Methods: Adult smokers who attended a clinic‐based tobacco cessation program were randomized into groups and followed for 13 weeks (1 week prequitting through 12 weeks postquitting). All study participants received nicotine patches and gum and were asked to complete EMAs five times a day on study‐provided smartphones for 5 weeks. Participants in the Smart‐T2 group received tailored treatment messages after the completion of each EMA. Both Smart‐T2 and QuitGuide apps offer on‐demand smoking cessation treatment. Results: Of 81 participants, 41 (50%) were women and 55 (68%) were white. On average, participants were aged 49.6 years and smoked 22.4 cigarettes per day at baseline. A total of 17% (14/81) of participants were biochemically confirmed 7‐day point prevalence abstinent at 12 weeks postquitting (Smart‐T2: 6/27, 22%, QuitGuide: 4/27, 15%, and usual care: 4/27, 15%), with no significant differences across groups (P>.05). Participants in the Smart‐T2 group rated the app positively, with most participants agreeing that they can rely on the app to help them quit smoking, and endorsed the belief that the app would help them stay quit, and these responses were not significantly different from the ratings given by participants in the usual care group. Conclusions: Dynamic smartphone apps that tailor intervention content in real time may increase user engagement and exposure to treatment‐related materials. The results of this pilot RCT suggest that smartphone‐based smoking cessation treatments may be capable of providing similar outcomes to traditional, in‐person counseling.

AB  - Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) has been identified as a transdiagnostic process that is involved in various forms of psychopathology, including anxiety and depression. This randomized controlled trial compared a 5‐week internet and app‐based gratitude intervention (intervention group; IG) with adherence‐focused guidance against a wait list control group (WLG) in reducing RNT in a sample with elevated RNT. Method: A total of 260 individuals were randomized to either the IG or the WLG. Data were collected at baseline (T1), within one week post intervention (T2), and at three (3‐MFU) and six‐months of follow‐up (6‐MFU; for IG only). The primary outcome was RNT. Secondary outcomes included other mental health outcomes and resilience factors. Results: Participants of the IG reported significantly less RNT at T2 (d = 0.61) and 3‐MFU (d = 0.75) as compared to WLG. Improvements were sustained until 6‐MFU. Significant, small to moderate effect sizes were identified for most secondary outcomes at T2 and 3‐MFU. Furthermore, results of mediation analyses revealed that the gratitude intervention exerts its effect on anxiety and depression by reducing the risk factor of RNT, while the mediating role of resilience was less clear. Conclusions: The gratitude intervention investigated in this study was found to be effective in reducing RNT. Gratitude interventions might affect mental health by two parallel pathways: increasing resources and reducing risk factors.

AB  - Athletes often have significant gaps in their nutrition knowledge. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether young Finnish endurance athletes' nutrition knowledge and dietary intake can be improved through an education intervention with or without a mobile food application. Seventy‐nine endurance athletes, 18.0 years (SD: 1.4), participated in this randomized, controlled intervention. We compared the effects of participatory nutrition education sessions alone (group EDU) to those including the use of a mobile food application (group EDU + APP) for four days after each session. Both groups attended three 90‐min education sessions fortnightly. The participants completed a validated nutrition knowledge questionnaire in Weeks 0, 5, and 17, and a three‐day food diary in Weeks 0 and 17. The education plan was based on the Self‐Determination Theory and the concept of meaningful learning process. The EDU group's nutrition knowledge scores were: 78 (week 0), 85 (week 5), and 84 (week 17) and the EDU + APP group's 78, 86, and 85, respectively. Nutrition knowledge increased significantly (main effect of time (p < 0.001)), but we observed no significant group Ã— time interaction (p = 0.309). The changes in dietary intakes were minor (p > 0.05). The amount of carbohydrates was below endurance athletes' recommendations throughout the intervention. The reported energy intakes were also below the estimated energy expenditures. In conclusion, nutrition knowledge improved significantly after only three education sessions and food diary feedback, but the mobile app did not improve learning further. However, the nutrition education intervention alone was not enough to change dietary intake.

AB  - Background: E‐mental health interventions may help to bridge the mental health treatment gap. Evidence on their effectiveness is compelling in high‐income countries. Not enough evidence has been generated on their use with communities affected by adversity in low‐ and middle‐income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO), the National Mental Health Programme (NMMP) at Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) in Lebanon and other partners have adapted a WHO intervention called Step‐by‐Step for use with Lebanese and displaced people living in Lebanon. Step‐by‐Step is a minimally guided, internet‐based intervention for adults with depression. In this study, a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) and a qualitative process evaluation were conducted to explore the feasibility and the acceptability of the research methods, and the intervention, in preparation for two fully powered trials to assess the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of Step‐by‐Step in Lebanon. Method: Participants were recruited through social media. Inclusion criteria were: being able to understand and speak Arabic or English; access to an internet connected device; aged over 18; living in Lebanon; scores above cut‐off on the Patient Health Questionnaire and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or enhanced care as usual. They completed post‐assessments eight weeks after baseline, and follow‐up assessments another three months later. Primary outcomes were depression and level of functioning, secondary outcomes were anxiety, post‐traumatic stress, and well‐being. Qualitative interviews were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the research procedures and the intervention. Results: A total of N = 138 participants, including 33 Syrians, were recruited and randomised into two equal groups. The dropout rate was higher in the control group (73% post‐ and 82% follow‐up assessment) than in the intervention group (63% post‐ and 72% follow‐up assessment). The intervention was perceived as relevant, acceptable and beneficial to those who completed it. Suggestions were made to further adapt the content and to make the intervention more engaging. Statistical analyses were conducted despite the small sample size. Complete cases analysis showed a statistically significant symptom reduction in depression, anxiety, disability, and post‐traumatic stress, and statistically significant improvement in well‐being and functioning. Intention‐to‐treat analysis revealed non‐significant effects. Conclusion: The research design, methods and procedures are feasible and acceptable in the context of Lebanon and can be applied in the RCTs. Preliminary findings suggest that Step‐by‐Step may be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety and improving functioning and well‐being.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) bought over the counter (OTC) appears to be largely ineffective for smoking cessation, which may be partially explained by poor adherence. We developed and evaluated the NRT2Quit smartphone app (for iOS) designed to improve quit attempts with OTC NRT by improving adherence to the medications. METHODS: This study was a pragmatic double‐blind randomised controlled trial with remote recruitment through leaflets distributed to over 300 UK‐based community pharmacies. The study recruited adult daily smokers (≥10 cigarettes per day) who bought NRT, wanted to quit smoking, downloaded NTR2Quit and completed the registration process within the app. Participants were automatically randomly assigned within the app to the intervention (full) version of NRT2Quit or to its control (minimal) versions. The primary outcome was biochemically verified 4‐week abstinence assessed at 8‐week follow‐up using Russell Standard criteria and intention to treat. Bayes factors were calculated for the cessation outcome. Secondary outcomes were self‐reported abstinence, NRT use, app use and satisfaction with the app. RESULTS: The study under‐recruited. Only 41 participants (3.5% of the target sample) were randomly assigned to NRT2Quit (n = 16) or the control (n = 25) app versions between March 2015 and September 2016. The follow‐up rate was 51.2%. The intervention participants had numerically higher biochemically verified quit rates (25.0% versus 8.0%, P = 0.19, odds ratio = 3.83, 0.61‐24.02). The calculated Bayes factor, 1.92, showed that the data were insensitive to test for the hypothesis that the intervention app version aided cessation. The intervention participants had higher median logins (2.5 versus 0, P = 0.01) and were more likely to use NRT at follow‐up (100.0% versus 28.6%, P = 0.03) and recommend NRT2Quit to others (100.0% versus 28.6%, P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite very low recruitment, there was preliminary but inconclusive evidence that NRT2Quit may improve short‐term abstinence and adherence among smokers using NRT. Well‐powered studies on NRT2Quit are needed, but different recruitment methods will be required to engage smokers through community pharmacies or other channels. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN ISRCTN33423896 , prospectively registered on 22 March 2015.

AB  - Objectives: Delivery of craving management tools via smartphone applications (apps) may improve smoking cessation rates, but research on such programmes remains limited, especially in real-world settings. This study evaluated the effectiveness of adding craving management tools in a cessation app (BupaQuit). Methods: The study was a two-arm pragmatic pilot parallel randomised controlled trial, comparing a fully-automated BupaQuit app with craving management tool with a control app version without craving management tool. A total of 425 adult UK-based daily smokers were enrolled through open online recruitment (February 2015-March 2016), with no researcher involvement, and individually randomised within the app to the intervention (n = 208) or control (n = 217). The primary outcome was self-reported 14-day continuous abstinence assessed at 4-week follow-up. Secondary outcomes included 6-month point-prevalence and sustained abstinence, and app usage. The primary outcome was assessed with Fisher's exact test using intent to treat with those lost to follow-up counted as smoking. Participants were not reimbursed. Results: Re-contact rates were 50.4% at 4 weeks and 40.2% at 6 months. There was no significant difference between intervention and control arms on the primary outcome (13.5% vs 15.7%; p = 0.58; relative risk = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.54-1.36) or secondary cessation outcomes (6-month point prevalence: 14.4% vs 17.1%, p = 0.51; relative risk = 0.85, 95% confidence interval = 0.54-1.32; 6-month sustained: 11.1% vs 13.4%, p = 0.55; relative risk = 0.83, 95% confidence interval = 0.50-1.38). Bayes factors supported the null hypothesis (B[0, 0, 1.0986] = 0.20). Usage was similar across the conditions (mean/median logins: 9.6/4 vs 10.5/5; time spent: 401.8/202 s vs 325.8/209 s). Conclusions: The addition of craving management tools did not affect cessation, and the limited engagement with the app may have contributed to this.

AB  - PURPOSE: Integrating mHealth into the cancer care continuum may be an effective strategy to improve cancer survivorship care by supporting self-management. We aim to assess the effectiveness of mHealth applications (apps) for self-management in improving pain, psychological distress, fatigue, or sleep outcomes in adult cancer survivors. METHODS: Experimental quantitative studies evaluating apps aiming to support self-management for adult cancer survivors and reporting pain, psychological distress, fatigue, or sleep outcomes were included. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception through December 2017. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (PROSPERO registration number CRD42017081182). RESULTS: Seven studies of six mHealth interventions (n = 949 participants) were included. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one quasi-RCT, one non-RCT, and three single-arm studies involved survivors with a mix of cancer types. The most common app features were symptom questionnaires (n = 5) and progress tracking (n = 5). Four studies reported outcomes for pain, with three showing improvements. Two studies reported psychological distress outcomes, showing mixed results. Four studies reported improvements in fatigue post-intervention or in the intervention compared with control group, but the changes were not all statistically significant. Two studies reported improvements in sleep outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence that mHealth interventions that support self-management can improve pain and fatigue outcomes in cancer survivors, and some promise for psychological distress and sleep outcomes. Further development and investigation of mHealth is needed, incorporating targeted, evidence-based models of care into app design. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: mHealth interventions can improve outcomes for cancer survivors and have significant potential to benefit this growing population due to their reach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Technology‐in particular, access to the Internet from a mobile device‐has forever changed the way we relate to others and how we behave in our daily life settings. In recent years, studies have been carried out to analyze the effectiveness of different actions via mobile phone in the field of health: telephone calls, short message service (SMS), telemedicine, and, more recently, the use of push notifications. We have continued to explore ways to increase user interaction with mobile apps, one of the pending subjects in the area of mHealth. By analyzing the data produced by subjects during a clinical trial, we were able to extract behavior patterns and, according to them, design effective protocols in weight loss programs. OBJECTIVE: A clinical trial was proposed to (1) evaluate the efficacy of push notifications in an intervention aimed at improving the body composition of adult women who are overweight or obese, through a dietary procedure, and (2) analyze the evolution of body composition based on push notifications and prescribed physical activity (PA). METHODS: A two‐arm randomized controlled trial was carried out. A sample size of 117 adult obese women attended a face‐to‐face, 30‐minute consultation once a week for 6 months. All patients were supplied with an app designed for this study and a pedometer. The control group did not have access to functionalities related to the self‐monitoring of weight at home, gamification, or prescription of PA. The intervention group members were assigned objectives to achieve a degree of compliance with diet and PA through exclusive access to specific functionalities of the app and push notifications. The same diet was prescribed for all patients. Three possible PA scenarios were studied for both the control and intervention groups: light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical activity (MPA), and intense physical activity (IPA). For the analysis of three or more means, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of repeated means was performed to evaluate the effects of the intervention at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: Receiving notifications during the intervention increased body fat loss (mean ‐12.9% [SD 6.7] in the intervention group vs mean ‐7.0% [SD 5.7] in the control group; P<.001) and helped to maintain muscle mass (mean ‐0.8% [SD 4.5] in the intervention group vs mean ‐3.2% [SD 2.8] in the control group; P<.018). These variations between groups led to a nonsignificant difference in weight loss (mean ‐7.9 kg [SD 3.9] in the intervention group vs mean ‐7.1 kg [SD 3.4] in the control group; P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Push notifications have proven effective in the proposed weight loss program, leading women who received them to achieve greater loss of fat mass and a maintenance or increase of muscle mass, specifically among those who followed a program of IPA. Future interventions should include a longer evaluation period; the impact of different message contents, as well as message delivery times and frequency, should also be researched.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, it is difficult to convey the benefits of sustained physical activity to adult patients with excess weight or obesity. For this purpose, a goal‐setting walking prescription may be an effective strategy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the intervention of a pedometer app in setting a goal to reach 10,000 steps per day in adults. METHODS: Overweight adults (n=98; mean body mass index 32.53 [SD 4.92] kg/m2) were randomized to one of two conditions (control or intervention). Both groups downloaded a pedometer app that recorded their daily step counts and were given a daily walking goal of 10,000 steps. Subjects participated in a 24‐week in‐person behavioral weight control program and were asked to monitor their daily levels using the pedometer app. Baseline data were recorded and followed up weekly. Only the intervention group had structured information delivery, a personalized physical activity prescription, and follow‐up on number of steps per day. RESULTS: The results show that regardless of sex or age, prescribing walking increased the number of steps per day by 4806 step on average (standardized Î² coefficient=‐0.813, SE=427.586, t=‐11.242, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results could have implications for improving self‐monitoring in overweight adults during periods of weight loss. Health professionals should analyze the implementation of tools that permit them to prescribe, follow up, and encourage the achievement of a goal of physical activity in overweight or obese patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Overcoming Addictions (OA) is an abstinence‐oriented, cognitive behavioral, Web application based on the program of SMART Recovery. SMART Recovery is an organization that has adapted empirically supported treatment strategies for use in a mutual help framework with in‐person meetings, online meetings, a forum, and other resources. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of OA and SMART Recovery (SR) with problem drinkers who were new to SMART Recovery. Our experimental hypotheses were: (1) all groups will reduce their drinking and alcohol/drug‐related consequences at follow‐up compared to their baseline levels, (2) the OA condition will reduce their drinking and alcohol/drug‐related consequences more than the control group (SR), and (3) the OA+SR condition will reduce their drinking and alcohol/drug‐related consequences more than the control group (SR only). METHODS: We recruited 189 heavy problem drinkers primarily through SMART Recovery's website and in‐person meetings throughout the United States. We randomly assigned participants to (1) OA alone, (2) OA+attend SMART Recovery (SR) meetings (OA+SR), or (3) attend SR only. Baseline and follow‐ups were conducted via GoToMeeting sessions with a Research Assistant (RA) and the study participant. We interviewed significant others to corroborate the participant's self‐report. Primary outcome measures included percent days abstinent (PDA), mean drinks per drinking day (DDD), and alcohol/drug‐related consequences. RESULTS: The intent‐to‐treat analysis of the 3‐month outcomes supported the first hypothesis but not the others. Participants in all groups significantly increased their percent days abstinent from 44% to 72% (P<.001), decreased their mean drinks per drinking day from 8.0 to 4.6 (P<.001), and decreased their alcohol/drug‐related problems (P<.001). Actual use relationships were found for the OA groups, between SR online meetings and improvement in PDA (r=.261, P=.033). In addition in the OA groups, the number of total sessions of support (including SR & other meetings, counselor visits) was significantly related to PDA (r=.306, P=012) and amount of improvement in alcohol‐related problems (r=.305, P=.012). In the SR only group, the number of face‐to‐face meetings was significantly related to all three dependent variables, and predicted increased PDA (r=.358, P=.003), fewer mean DDD (r=‐.250, P=.039), and fewer alcohol‐related problems (r=‐.244, P=.045), as well as to the amount of improvement in all three of these variables. Six‐month follow‐ups have been completed, and the results are currently being analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These results support our first experimental hypothesis but not the second or third. All groups significantly increased their PDA and decreased both their mean DDD and their alcohol‐related problems, which indicates that both interventions being investigated were equally effective in helping people recover from their problem drinking.

AB  - Objectives: Smokers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have increased difficulty achieving and maintaining abstinence. Contingency management approaches to smoking cessation interventions have demonstrated short‐term efficacy but are limited by high rates of relapse. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the usability and feasibility of a smartphone‐based smoking cessation application (Stay Quit Coach) designed to prevent relapse among individuals with PTSD. Methods: Smokers (N = 11) were randomized to (1) QUIT4EVER, an intervention combining mobile contingency management smoking cessation counseling and medications, and Stay Quit Coach or (2) a contact control condition that was identical to QUIT4EVER except Stay Quit Coach was not included. The primary outcome was prolonged smoking abstinence. Results: Among those queried during the follow‐up periods, average Stay Quit Coach helpfulness ratings were high and ranged from 7.25 to 10 on a 10‐point Likert scale (with higher scores corresponding to greater helpfulness). The Stay Quit Coach was rated by participants as being most effective at helping to quit smoking, helping to remain quit, and providing support and relevant information about quitting. Among the three quitters in the QUIT4EVER group, all reported abstinence at 3 and 6 months; however, abstinence was only bioverified for one quitter at 6 months. Among the four quitters in the contact control condition group, three reported abstinence at 3 and 6 months, but abstinence was not confirmed by bioverification. Conclusions: Smokers with PTSD express interest in and helpfulness of Stay Quit Coach for remaining abstinent after a quit attempt. Combined use of mobile contingency management and Stay Quit Coach is a feasible and acceptable adjunctive smoking cessation treatment for reducing smoking among smokers with PTSD. Adequately powered clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the long‐term efficacy of this combined approach to smoking cessation.

AB  - Mobile apps provide a highly accessible way of reducing alcohol use in young people. This paper determines the 1‐month efficacy and 2, 3 and 6month outcomes of the Ray's Night Out app, which aims to increase alcohol knowledge and reduce alcohol use in young people. User‐experience design and agile development processes, informed by the Information‐Motivation‐Behavioral skills model and evidence‐based motivational interviewing treatment approaches guided app development. A randomized controlled trial comparing immediate versus 1‐month delayed access to the app was conducted in 197 young people (16 to 25years) who drank alcohol in the previous month. Participants were assessed at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 6months. Alcohol knowledge, alcohol use and related harms and the severity of problematic drinking were assessed. App quality was evaluated after 1‐month of app use. Participants in the immediate access group achieved a significantly greater increase in alcohol knowledge than the delayed access group at 1‐month, but no differences in alcohol use or related problems were found. Both groups achieved significant reductions in the typical number of drinks on a drinking occasion over time. A reduction in maximum drinks consumed was also found at 1month. These reductions were most likely to occur in males and problem drinkers. Reductions in alcohol‐related harm were also found. The app received a high mean quality (M=3.82/5, SD=0.51). The Ray app provides a youth‐friendly and easily‐accessible way of increasing young people's alcohol knowledge but further testing is required to determine its impact on alcohol use and related problems.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a mobile app can reduce the need for in‐person visits and examine the resulting societal cost differences between mobile and conventional follow‐up for postoperative anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction patients. METHODS: Study design was a single‐center, 2‐arm parallel group randomized controlled trial. All patients undergoing ACL reconstruction aged 16 to 70 years were screened for inclusion in the study. Competent use of a mobile device and ability to communicate in English was required. Patients were randomly assigned to receive follow‐up via a mobile app or conventional appointments. Analysis was intention‐to‐treat. The primary outcome was the number of in‐person visits to any health care professional during the first 6 postoperative weeks. Secondary outcomes included analysis of costs incurred by the health care system and personal patient costs related to both methods of follow‐up. Patient‐reported satisfaction and convenience scores, rates of complications, and clinical outcomes were also analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty patients were analyzed. Participants in the app group attended a mean of 0.36 in‐person visits versus 2.44 in‐person visits in the conventional group (95% confidence interval 0.08‐0.28; P < .0001). On average, patients in the app group spent $211 (Canadian dollars) less than the conventional group over 6 weeks (P < .0001) on personal costs related to follow‐up. Health care system costs were also significantly less in the app group ($157.5 vs CAD $202.2; P < .0001). There was no difference between groups in patient satisfaction, convenience, complication rates, or clinical outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile follow‐up can eliminate a significant number of in‐person visits during the first 6 postoperative weeks in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction with cost savings to both the patient and health care system. This method should be considered for dissemination among similar orthopaedic procedures during early postoperative care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I: Prospective randomized controlled trial.

AB  - HIV incidence among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) is disproportionally high. Youth living with HIV demonstrate low rates of sustained virologic suppression (VS). Epic Allies, a theory‐based behavioral intervention mobile app, utilizes self‐management tools, gamification, and social support to improve engagement in care and antiretroviral adherence among YMSM living with HIV. A two‐arm individually randomized‐controlled trial enrolled 146 participants aged 16 to 24 years old to test the efficacy of Epic Allies to achieve VS. Both study arms showed improved VS at 26‐weeks (62.9% intervention; 73.5% control; ARR = 0.93 (95% CI 0.73, 1.18)) and antiretroviral adherence; intervention effects were amplified in regular app users. Issues with recruitment and app usage metrics limit the ability to definitively say that the app was effective in causing behavior changes resulting in improved health outcomes.

AB  - Objective: Guided self‐help treatments based on cognitive‐behavior therapy (CBT‐GSH) are efficacious for binge eating. With limited availability of CBT‐GSH in the community, mobile technology offers a means to increase use of these interventions. The purpose of this study was to test the initial efficacy of Noom Monitor, a smartphone application designed to facilitate CBT‐GSH (CBT‐GSH+Noom), on study retention, adherence, and eating disorder symptoms compared to traditional CBT‐GSH. Method: Sixty‐six men and women with DSM‐5 binge‐eating disorder (BED) or bulimia nervosa (BN) were randomized to receive eight sessions of CBT‐GSH+Noom (n=33) or CBT‐GSH (n=33) over 12 weeks. Primary symptom outcomes were eating disorder examination objective bulimic episodes (OBEs), subjective bulimic episodes (SBEs), and compensatory behaviors. Assessments were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. Behavioral outcomes were modeled using zero‐inflated negative‐binomial latent growth curve models with intent‐to‐treat. Results: There was a significant effect of treatment on change in OBEs (beta=‐0.84, 95% CI=‐1.49, ‐0.19) favoring CBT‐GSH+Noom. Remission rates were not statistically different between treatments for OBEs (betalogit=‐0.73, 95% CI=‐1.86, 3.27; CBT‐GSH‐Noom=17/27, 63.0% vs. CBT‐GSH 11/27, 40.7%, NNT=4.5), but CBT‐GSH‐Noom participants reported greater meal and snack adherence and regular meal adherence mediated treatment effects on OBEs. The treatments did not differ at the 6‐month follow‐up. Discussion: Smartphone applications for the treatment binge eating appear to have advantages for adherence, a critical component of treatment dissemination. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cognitive‐behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficacy in the treatment of eating disorders. The authors conducted a randomized controlled telemedicine trial of CBT‐guided self‐help (CBT‐GSH) assisted with a smartphone app, Noom Monitor, for binge eating with or without purging. They hypothesized that coach‐delivered CBT‐GSH telemedicine sessions plus Noom Monitor would yield greater reductions in symptoms of binge eating, purging, and eating disorders compared with standard care. METHODS: Fifty‐two‐week outcomes for CBT‐GSH plus Noom Monitor (N=114) were compared with outcomes for standard care (N=111) among members of an integrated health care system in the Pacific Northwest. Patients in the health system who met inclusion criteria were â‰¥18 years old, had a body mass index â‰¥18.5, met criteria for DSM‐5 binge eating disorder or bulimia nervosa, had 12 months of continuous health care enrollment in Kaiser Permanente Northwest, and had a personal smartphone. Participants received eight CBT‐GSH telemedicine sessions over 12 weeks administered by health coaches, and outcomes were assessed at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52. The use of available treatment offered within the Kaiser Permanente health care system was permitted for participants assigned to standard care. RESULTS: Participants who received CBT‐GSH plus Noom Monitor reported significant reductions in objective binge‐eating days (Î²=‐0.66, 95% CI=‐1.06, ‐0.25; Cohen's d=‐1.46, 95% CI=‐4.63, ‐1.09) and achieved higher rates of remission (56.7% compared with 30%; number needed to treat=3.74) at 52 weeks compared with participants in standard care, none of whom received any eating disorder treatment during the intervention period (baseline and weeks 1‐12). Similar patterns emerged for compensatory behaviors (vomiting, use of laxatives, and excessive exercise; 76.3% compared with 56.8%; number needed to treat=5.11), eating disorder symptoms (body shape, weight, eating concerns, and dietary restraint), and clinical impairment (Cohen's d=‐10.07, ‐2.15). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBT‐GSH plus Noom Monitor delivered via telemedicine by routine‐practice health coaches in a nonacademic health care system yields reductions in symptoms and impairment over 52 weeks compared with standard care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones with programmable apps may offer innovative interactive interventions for improving adherence among people living with HIV with substance use problems. METHODS: This pilot randomized controlled trial sought to primarily determine the usability and feasibility of using a smartphone‐based intervention called Heart2HAART as an adjunct to directly observed treatment with adherence counseling compared to directly observed treatment with adherence counseling alone among those with HIV and a history of substance use over a three‐month time frame. Participants in the Heart2HAART condition completed an additional survey on usability and acceptability. Adherence was measured using unannounced pill counts assessed via a phone call. RESULTS: Twenty‐eight participants were randomized to receive Heart2HAART (n = 19) or control (n = 9). All were receiving either weekly (n = 9) or daily (n = 19) observed treatment. Among those randomized to Heart2HAART, 63.2% reported no difficulty using the Heart2HAART smartphone application and 94.7% responded that the medication reminders did not interfere negatively with their activities. On average participants used Heart2HAART application 56.8 times over the three‐month trial. In analyses adjusting for age, there was no difference in adherence to HAART medication between the Heart2HAART and control group as evaluated by the random pill count assessment (P = .29). CONCLUSIONS: Heart2HAART was feasible to use during a three‐month pilot trial. Future studies may evaluate a more tailored approach, with more robust contingency management.

AB  - Introduction: Many type 2 diabetes patients show insufficient levels of physical activity and are often unmotivated to change physical activity behaviors. This study investigated whether a newly developed smartphone game delivering individualized exercise and physical activity promotion through an elaborate storyline can generate sustained improvements in daily physical activity (steps/day). Study design: Thirty‐six participants were enrolled in this 24‐week RCT between August 2016 and April 2018. After baseline assessment, participants were randomized in equal numbers to the intervention or control condition. Data analysis was performed in May–June 2018. Setting/participants: Inactive, overweight type 2 diabetes patients, aged 45–70 years, were recruited through advertising and from hospitals and diabetes care centers in the Basel, Switzerland, metropolitan area. Intervention: Participants were instructed to play the innovative smartphone game (intervention group) or to implement the recommendations from the baseline lifestyle counseling (control group) autonomously during the 24‐week intervention period. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were changes in daily physical activity (steps/day); changes in aerobic capacity, measured as oxygen uptake at the first ventilatory threshold; and changes in glycemic control, measured as HbA1c. Results: Daily physical activity increased by an average of 3,998 (SD=1,293) steps/day in the intervention group and by an average of 939 (SD=1,156) steps/day in the control group. The adjusted difference between the two groups was 3,128 steps/day (95% CI=2,313, 3,943, p<0.001). The increase in daily physical activity was accompanied by an improved aerobic capacity (adjusted difference of oxygen uptake at the first ventilatory threshold of 1.9 mL/(kg·min), 95% CI=0.9, 2.9, p<0.001). Glycemic control (HbA1c) did not change over the course of the intervention. Conclusions: A novel, self‐developed smartphone game, delivering multidimensional home‐based exercise and physical activity promotion, significantly increases daily physical activity (steps/day) and aerobic capacity in inactive type 2 diabetes patients after 24 weeks. The ability of the game to elicit a sustained physical activity motivation may be relevant for other inactive target groups with chronic diseases. Trial registration: This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02657018.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The growing epidemic of opioid use disorder (OUD) and associated injection drug use has resulted in a surge of new hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Approximately half of the people with HCV infection are unaware of their HCV status. Improving HCV awareness and increasing screening among people with OUD are critical. Addiction‐Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (A‐CHESS) is an evidence‐based, smartphone‐delivered relapse prevention system that has been implemented among people with OUD who are receiving medications for addiction treatment (MAT) to improve long‐term recovery. OBJECTIVE: We incorporated HCV‐related content and functionality into A‐CHESS to characterize the HCV care continuum among people in early remission and receiving MAT for OUD and to determine whether incorporating such content and functionality into A‐CHESS increases HCV testing. METHODS: HCV intervention content, including dissemination of educational information, private messages tailored to individuals' stage of HCV care, and a public discussion forum, was implemented into the A‐CHESS platform. Between April 2016 and April 2020, 416 participants with OUD were enrolled in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive MAT alone (control arm) or MAT+A‐CHESS (experimental arm). Quarterly telephone interviews were conducted from baseline to month 24 to assess risk behaviors and HCV testing history. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess whether participants who used A‐CHESS were tested for HCV (either antibody [Ab] or RNA testing) at a higher rate than those in the control arm. To assess the effect of A‐CHESS on subsets of participants at the highest risk for HCV, additional analyses were performed to examine the effect of the intervention among participants who injected drugs and shared injection equipment. RESULTS: Overall, 44.2% (184/416) of the study participants were HCV Ab positive, 30.3% (126/416) were HCV Ab negative, and 25.5% (106/416) were considered untested at baseline. At month 24, there was no overall difference in HCV testing uptake between the intervention and control participants. However, among the subset of 109 participants who engaged in injection drug use, there was a slight trend toward increased HCV testing uptake among those who used A‐CHESS (89% vs 85%; hazard ratio: 1.34; 95% CI 0.87‐2.05; P=.18), and a stronger trend was observed when focusing on the subset of 32 participants who reported sharing injection equipment (87% vs 56%; hazard ratio: 2.92; 95% CI 0.959‐8.86; P=.06). CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating HCV prevention and care information into A‐CHESS may increase the uptake of HCV testing while preventing opioid relapse when implemented among populations who engage in high‐risk behaviors such as sharing contaminated injection equipment. However, more studies that are powered to detect differences in HCV testing among high‐risk groups are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management is crucial in the daily management of type 2 diabetes. It has been suggested that mHealth may be an important method for enhancing self-management when delivered in combination with health counseling. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test whether the use of a mobile phone-based self-management system used for 1 year, with or without telephone health counseling by a diabetes specialist nurse for the first 4 months, could improve glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, self-management, and health-related quality of life compared with usual care. METHODS: We conducted a 3-arm prospective randomized controlled trial involving 2 intervention groups and 1 control group. Eligible participants were persons with type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c level >=7.1% (>=54.1 mmol/mol) and aged >=18 years. Both intervention groups received the mobile phone-based self-management system Few Touch Application (FTA). The FTA consisted of a blood glucose-measuring system with automatic wireless data transfer, diet manual, physical activity registration, and management of personal goals, all recorded and operated using a diabetes diary app on the mobile phone. In addition, one intervention group received health counseling based on behavior change theory and delivered by a diabetes specialist nurse for the first 4 months after randomization. All groups received usual care by their general practitioner. The primary outcome was HbA1c level. Secondary outcomes were self-management (heiQ), health-related quality of life (SF-36), depressive symptoms (CES-D), and lifestyle changes (dietary habits and physical activity). Data were analyzed using univariate methods (t test, ANOVA) and multivariate linear and logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 151 participants were randomized: 51 to the FTA group, 50 to the FTA-health counseling (FTA-HC) group, and 50 to the control group. Follow-up data after 1 year were available for 120 participants (79%). HbA1c level decreased in all groups, but did not differ between groups after 1 year. The mean change in the heiQ domain skills and technique acquisition was significantly greater in the FTA-HC group after adjusting for age, gender, and education (P=.04). Other secondary outcomes did not differ between groups after 1 year. In the FTA group, 39% were substantial users of the app; 34% of the FTA-HC group were substantial users. Those aged >=63 years used the app more than their younger counterparts did (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.02-7.12; P=.045). CONCLUSIONS: The change in HbA1c level did not differ between groups after the 1-year intervention. Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups except for an increase in the self-management domain of skill and technique acquisition in the FTA-HC group. Older participants used the app more than the younger participants did.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate stages of change for physical activity and dietary habits using baseline data from persons with type 2 diabetes included in a mobile health intervention. We examined the associations between stages of change for physical activity change and dietary change, and between stages of change for each behavior and individual characteristics, health‐related quality of life, selfmanagement, depressive symptoms, and lifestyle. Research design and methods: We examined 151 persons with type 2 diabetes with an glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level >7.1%, aged >18 years at baseline of a randomized controlled trial, before testing a mobile app with or without health counseling. Stages of change were dichotomized into 'pre‐action' and 'action'. Self‐management was measured using the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) where a higher score reflects increased self‐management, and health‐related quality of life was measured with the Short‐Form36 (SF‐36). Logistic regression modeling was performed. Results: The median HbA1c level was 7.9% (7.1‐ 12.4), 90% were overweight or obese, and 20% had >3 comorbidities. 58% were in the preaction stage for physical activity change and 79% in the preaction stage for dietary change. Higher scores of self‐management were associated with an increased chance of being in the action stage for both dietary change and physical activity change. Higher body mass index was associated with an 8% reduced chance of being in the action stage for physical activity change (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99). Conclusions: Being in the action stage was associated with higher scores of self‐management, crucial for type 2 diabetes. Over half of the participants were in the preaction stage for physical activity and dietary change, and many had a high disease burden with comorbidities and overweight.

AB  - Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) involves intentional and self-directed harm (e.g., self-cutting, burning) that is enacted without suicidal intent. NSSI is associated with both physical and social-emotional harm in the short and long-term. Unfortunately, few approaches to date have consistently reduced NSSI compared to active control treatments. One notable exception is the intervention developed by Franklin et al. This intervention, called Therapeutic Evaluative Conditioning (TEC), uses a form of Pavlovian conditioning to increase aversion to self-injury stimuli (e.g., knives, blood) and to decrease aversion to the self (i.e., reduce self-criticism). Utilizing an online, app-based treatment and across three randomized control trials, TEC resulted in significant reductions in NSSI, suicide plans, and suicide attempts, compared to an active control treatment. This chapter uses this information to create a new, online treatment program for NSSI. Specifically, it conducts a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate Autobiographical Self-Enhancement Training (ASET)-a novel, cognitive intervention for NSSI focused on reducing self-criticism and enhancing positive self-worth. For the present RCT, the chapter tests ASET against another potentially active treatment (expressive writing) and also against a control treatment (journaling). Finally, it uses a journaling condition as a comparison control intervention. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: More than 70% of the health expenditure is related to chronic diseases. Therefore, an efficient managerial program can markedly reduce medical and administrative costs and benefit both patients and service providers. The use of mobile technologies can be very helpful in this regard. This study was conducted to determine the effect of mobile learning (application) on self‐care behaviors and blood glucose control of type 2 diabetic patients attending the Diabetes Clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex. Methods: This interventional, quasi‐experimental study was conducted on 51 diabetic patients. The patients were randomly assigned to case and control groups, and a specifically designed application was used in the case group for three months. Self‐care behavior, FBS, and HbA1C were assessed in both groups before and three months after the intervention, and the results were analyzed after the intervention. The Summary of Diabetes Self‐Care Activities (SDSCA) measure and medical records was used for data collection. Descriptive and inferential statics (paired t test, ANCOVA analysis) were used for data analysis. Results: The Mean Â± SD of the self‐care posttest score, FBS, and HbA1C was 76.95 Â± 7.94 vs. 43.4 Â± 9.74 (P = 0.001), 143.58 Â± 23.39 vs. 171.81 Â± 36.98 (P = 0.001), and 6.84 Â± 0.63 vs. 8.10 Â± 0.10 (P = 0,001), in the case and control group respectively, indicating a difference in all cases. Conclusions: The results indicated the positive effect of the mobile application on self‐care behavior, FBS, and HbA1C.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study is one of the first randomized controlled trials investigating cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT‐I) delivered by a fully automated mobile phone app. Such an app can potentially increase the accessibility of insomnia treatment for the 10% of people who have insomnia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the efficacy of CBT‐I delivered via the Sleepcare mobile phone app, compared with a waitlist control group, in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: We recruited participants in the Netherlands with relatively mild insomnia disorder. After answering an online pretest questionnaire, they were randomly assigned to the app (n=74) or the waitlist condition (n=77). The app packaged a sleep diary, a relaxation exercise, sleep restriction exercise, and sleep hygiene and education. The app was fully automated and adjusted itself to a participant's progress. Program duration was 6 to 7 weeks, after which participants received posttest measurements and a 3‐month follow‐up. The participants in the waitlist condition received the app after they completed the posttest questionnaire. The measurements consisted of questionnaires and 7‐day online diaries. The questionnaires measured insomnia severity, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and anxiety and depression symptoms. The diary measured sleep variables such as sleep efficiency. We performed multilevel analyses to study the interaction effects between time and condition. RESULTS: The results showed significant interaction effects (P<.01) favoring the app condition on the primary outcome measures of insomnia severity (d=‐0.66) and sleep efficiency (d=0.71). Overall, these improvements were also retained in a 3‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the efficacy of a fully automated mobile phone app in the treatment of relatively mild insomnia. The effects were in the range of what is found for Web‐based treatment in general. This supports the applicability of such technical tools in the treatment of insomnia. Future work should examine the generalizability to a more diverse population. Furthermore, the separate components of such an app should be investigated. It remains to be seen how this app can best be integrated into the current health regimens.

AB  - APP+ is a theoretically‐grounded mobile app intervention to improve antiretroviral (ART) adherence among men who have sex with men (MSM) who use stimulants. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of APP+ in a six‐month randomized controlled trial among a national sample of 90 MSM recruited online; secondarily, we examined changes in self‐reported ART adherence by study arm. Retention at the final assessment was 82%, and acceptability ratings were comparable to other technology‐based interventions. MSM in the APP+ group reported higher self‐reported percentage ART adherence in the past 30 days at the four‐month timepoint compared to a no‐treatment control group (89.0% vs. 77.2%). However, once access to the app was removed after month four, group differences in ART adherence diminished by month six. APP+ may be a potentially promising intervention approach for MSM living with HIV who use stimulants but would require enhancements to optimize acceptability and demonstrate more sustained effects.

AB  - We conducted a systematic review with meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of diabetes apps. 1550 participants from 21 studies were included. For type 1 diabetes, a significant 0.49% reduction in HbA1c was seen (95%CI 0.04 to 0.94; I2=84%), with unexplained heterogeneity and a low GRADE of evidence. For type 2 diabetes, using diabetes apps was associated with a mean reduction of 0.57% (95%CI 0.32 to 0.82, I2=77%). The results had severe heterogeneity that was explained by the frequency of HCP feedback. In studies with no HCP feedback, low frequency, and high frequency HCP feedback, the mean reduction is 0.24% (95%CI ‐0.02 to 0.49; I2=0%), 0.33% (95%CI 0.07 to 0.59; I2=47%), and 1.12% (95%CI 0.91 to 1.32; I2=0%) respectively, with high GRADE of evidence. There is evidence that diabetes apps improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes patients. A reduction of 0.57% in HbA1c was found in type 2 diabetes patients. However, HCP functionality is important to achieve clinical effectiveness. Futures studies need to explore the cost‐effectiveness of diabetes apps and optimal intensity of HCP feedback.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rehabilitation is crucial for postoperative patients with low back pain (LBP). However, the implementation of traditional clinic‐based programs is limited in developing countries, such as China, because of the maldistribution of medical resources. Mobile phone‐based programs may be a potential substitute for those who have no access to traditional rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of mobile phone‐based rehabilitation systems in patients who underwent lumbar spinal surgery. METHODS: Patients who accepted spinal surgeries were recruited and randomized into 2 groups of rehabilitation treatments: (1) a mobile phone‐based eHealth (electronic health) program (EH) or (2) usual care treatment (UC). The primary outcomes were (1) function and pain status assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and (2) the visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes were (1) general mental health and (2) quality of life (Likert scales, EuroQol‐5 Dimension health questionnaire, and 36‐item Short‐Form Health Survey). All the patients were assessed preoperatively and then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 168 of the 863 eligible patients were included and randomized in this study. Our analysis showed that the improvement of primary outcomes in the EH group was superior to the UC group at 24 months postoperatively (ODI mean 7.02, SD 3.10, P<.05; VAS mean 7.59, SD 3.42, P<.05). No significant difference of primary outcomes was found at other time points. A subgroup analysis showed that the improvements of the primary outcomes were more significant in those who completed 6 or more training sessions each week throughout the trial (the highest compliance group) compared with the UC group at 6 months (ODI mean 17.94, SD 5.24, P<.05; VAS mean 19.56, SD 5.27, P<.05), 12 months (ODI mean 13.39, SD 5.32, P<.05; VAS mean 14.35, SD 5.23, P<.05), and 24 months (ODI mean 18.80, SD 5.22, P<.05; VAS mean 21.56, SD 5.28, P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated that a mobile phone‐based telerehabilitation system is effective in self‐managed rehabilitation for postoperative patients with LBP. The effectiveness of eHealth was more evident in participants with higher compliance. Future research should focus on improving patients' compliance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are over 2 million newly diagnosed patients with breast cancer worldwide with more than 10,000 cases in Taiwan each year. During 2017‐2018, the National Yang‐Ming University, the Taiwan University of Science and Technology, and the Taiwan Breast Cancer Prevention Foundation collaborated to develop a breast cancer self‐management support (BCSMS) mHealth app for Taiwanese women with breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of women with breast cancer in Taiwan after using the BCSMS app. METHODS: After receiving a first diagnosis of breast cancer, women with stage 0 to III breast cancer, who were recruited from social networking sites or referred by their oncologists or oncology case managers, were randomized 1:1 into intervention and control groups. Intervention group subjects used the BCSMS app and the control group subjects received usual care. Two questionnaires‐the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality‐of‐Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ‐C30) and the EORTC Breast Cancer‐Specific Quality‐of‐Life Questionnaire (QLQ‐BR23)‐were distributed to subjects in both arms. Paper‐based questionnaires were used at baseline; paper‐based or Web‐based questionnaires were used at 1.5‐month and 3‐month follow‐up evaluations. All evaluations were self‐assessed and anonymous, and participants were blinded to their allocation groups. Descriptive analysis, the Pearson chi‐square test, analysis of variance, and the generalized estimating equation were used to analyze the data. Missing values, with and without multi‐imputation techniques, were used for sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: A total of 112 women were enrolled and randomly allocated to either the experimental group (n=53) or control group (n=59). The follow‐up completion rate was 89.3% (100/112). The demographic data showed homogeneity between the two groups in age (range 50‐64 years), breast cancer stage (stage II), marital status (married), working status (employed), and treatment status (receiving treatments). The mean total QoL summary scores from the QLQ‐C30 (83.45 vs 82.23, P=.03) and the QLQ‐BR23 (65.53 vs 63.13, P=.04) were significantly higher among the experimental group versus the control group, respectively, at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides support for using a mobile health care app to promote the QoL among women in Taiwan after a first diagnosis of breast cancer. The BCSMS app could be used to support disease self‐management, and further evaluation of whether QoL is sustained is warranted.

AB  - Smartphones are revolutionizing approaches to wellbeing investment. Those seeking greater happiness can engage with thousands of downloadable self-help applications instantly, yet their effectiveness remains largely unknown. This investigation explored the viability of delivering a positive psychological intervention in application format to authentic happiness seekers. A smartphone-based randomized-controlled trial was conducted with a diverse self-selecting pool, randomly assigned to engage with an empirically supported mindfulness intervention (n = 57) or a control intervention (n = 64) for 10 days. The study explored smartphone methodology, the importance of empirically based content for wellbeing enhancement and the extent to which user experience related to wellbeing gains. Results of repeated measures ANOVAs showed statistically significant increases in positive affect with a medium effect size and reduced depressive symptoms with a small effect size, although no statistically significant differences in satisfaction with life, flourishing or negative affect were found. No statistically significant gains were observed in the control condition. Ratings of task enjoyment were positively correlated (Pearson's r) with positive affect increase. Findings support the viability of smartphone-based interventions to significantly enhance elements of wellbeing, underscoring the importance of application content and the role of person-activity fit. This investigation presents implications for happiness seeking strategies in the real world whilst showcasing a dynamic method of intervention delivery that can benefit future research and practice. If the greatest mission of positive psychology is to enhance global flourishing, the potential of smartphone-based interventions may play a vital role.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of smartphone apps for improving medication adherence in type 2 diabetes is not well studied in Asian populations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of using a smartphone app to improve medication adherence in a multiethnic Asian population with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We block randomized 51 nonadherent and digitally literate patients with type 2 diabetes between the ages of 21 and 75 years into two treatment arms (control: usual care; intervention: usual care+Medisafe app) and followed them up for 12 weeks. Recruitment occurred at a public tertiary diabetes specialist outpatient center in Singapore. The intervention group received email reminders to complete online surveys monthly, while the control group only received an email reminder(s) at the end of the study. Barriers to medication adherence and self‐appraisal of diabetes were assessed using the Adherence Starts with Knowledge‐12 (ASK‐12) and Appraisal of Diabetes Scale (ADS) questionnaires at baseline and poststudy in both groups. Perception toward medication adherence and app usage, attitude, and satisfaction were assessed in the intervention group during and after the follow‐up period. Sociodemographic data were collected at baseline. Clinical data (ie, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, low‐density lipoprotein, high‐density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol levels) were extracted from patients' electronic medical records. RESULTS: A total of 51 (intervention group: 25 [49%]; control group: 26 [51%]) participants were randomized, of which 41 (intervention group: 22 [88.0%]; control group: 19 [73.1%]) completed the poststudy survey. The baseline‐adjusted poststudy ASK‐12 score was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group (mean difference: 4.7, P=.01). No changes were observed in the clinical outcomes. The average 12‐week medication adherence rate of participants tracked by the app was between 38.3% and 100% in the intervention group. The majority (>80%) of the participants agreed that the app was easy to use and made them more adherent to their medication. CONCLUSIONS: Our feasibility study showed that among medication‐nonadherent patients with type 2 diabetes, a smartphone app intervention was acceptable, improved awareness of medication adherence, and reduced self‐reported barriers to medication adherence, but did not improve clinical outcomes in a developed Asian setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: College students experience high levels of stress. Mindfulness meditation delivered via a mobile app may be an appealing, efficacious way to reduce stress in college students. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the initial efficacy and sustained effects of an 8‐week mindfulness meditation mobile app‐Calm‐compared to a wait‐list control on stress, mindfulness, and self‐compassion in college students with elevated stress. We also explored the intervention's effect on health behaviors (ie, sleep disturbance, alcohol consumption [binge drinking], physical activity, and healthy eating [fruit and vegetable consumption]) and the feasibility and acceptability of the app. METHODS: This study was a randomized, wait‐list, control trial with assessments at baseline, postintervention (8 weeks), and at follow‐up (12 weeks). Participants were eligible if they were current full‐time undergraduate students and (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) scored ≥14 points on the Perceived Stress Scale, (3) owned a smartphone, (4) were willing to download the Calm app, (5) were willing to be randomized, and (7) were able to read and understand English. Participants were asked to meditate using Calm at least 10 minutes per day. A P value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 88 participants were included in the analysis. The mean age (SD) was 20.41 (2.31) years for the intervention group and 21.85 (6.3) years for the control group. There were significant differences in all outcomes (stress, mindfulness, and self‐compassion) between the intervention and control groups after adjustment for covariates postintervention (all P<.04). These effects persisted at follow‐up (all P<.03), except for the nonreacting subscale of mindfulness (P=.08). There was a significant interaction between group and time factors in perceived stress (P=.002), mindfulness (P<.001), and self‐compassion (P<.001). Bonferroni posthoc tests showed significant within‐group mean differences for perceived stress in the intervention group (P<.001), while there were no significant within‐group mean differences in the control group (all P>.19). Similar results were found for mindfulness and self‐compassion. Effect sizes ranged from moderate (0.59) to large (1.24) across all outcomes. A significant group×time interaction in models of sleep disturbance was found, but no significant effects were found for other health behaviors. The majority of students in the intervention group reported that Calm was helpful to reduce stress and stated they would use Calm in the future. The majority were satisfied using Calm and likely to recommend it to other college students. The intervention group participated in meditation for an average of 38 minutes/week during the intervention and 20 minutes/week during follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Calm is an effective modality to deliver mindfulness meditation in order to reduce stress and improve mindfulness and self‐compassion in stressed college students. Our findings provide important information that can be applied to the design of future studies or mental health resources in university programs.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to 1) determine the effects of a meditation app on depression and anxiety in adults with sleep disturbance, and 2) explore the potential mediating effects of fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre‐sleep arousal on the relationship between use of the meditation app and changes in depression and anxiety. Methods: Participants were 239 adults with elevated insomnia symptoms (i.e., scores ? 10 on the Insomnia Severity Index) and limited or no previous experience with meditation. Depression, anxiety, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre‐sleep arousal were assessed at baseline, four weeks, and eight weeks. Repeated‐measures ANCOVAs assessed intervention effects on depression and anxiety. Mediation models were estimated using the PROCESS macro. Results: Participants in the meditation group had more improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms during the intervention period than did those in the control group. Changes in somatic and cognitive pre‐sleep arousal at mid‐intervention fully mediated effects on depression and partially mediated effects on anxiety. There were no significant indirect effects of fatigue and daytime‐sleepiness on changes in mental health. Conclusions: A meditation app may improve depression and anxiety in adults with sleep disturbance, with effects being driven by improvements in pre‐sleep arousal. Future studies should consider targeting pre‐sleep arousal to improve mental health in this population.

AB  - The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to test whether a commercially available, mindfulness meditation mobile app, (i.e., Calm app), was effective in reducing fatigue (primary outcome), pre‐sleep arousal, and daytime sleepiness (secondary outcomes) in adults with sleep disturbance (Insomnia Severity Index Score >10) as compared to a wait‐list control group. Associations between the use of the Calm app (i.e., adherence to the intervention) and changes in sleep quality was also explored in the intervention group only. Adults with sleep disturbance were recruited (N = 640). Eligible and consenting participants (N = 263) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 124) or a wait‐list control (n = 139) group. Intervention participants were asked to meditate using the Calm app ≥10 minutes/day for eight weeks. Fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre‐sleep arousal were assessed at baseline, mid‐ (4‐weeks) and post‐intervention (8‐weeks) in both groups, whereas sleep quality was evaluated only in the intervention group. Findings from intent‐to‐treat analyses suggest the use of the Calm app for eight weeks significantly decreased daytime fatigue (p = .018) as well as daytime sleepiness (p = .003) and cognitive (p = .005) and somatic (p < .001) pre‐sleep arousal as compared to the wait‐list control group. Within the intervention group, use of the Calm app was associated with improvements in sleep quality (p < .001). This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that the Calm app can be used to treat fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre‐sleep arousal in adults with sleep disturbance. Given that the Calm app is affordable and widely accessible, these data have implications for community level dissemination of a mobile app to improve sleep‐related symptoms associated with sleep disturbance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Telehealth is promoted as a strategy to support self-management of long-term conditions. The aim of this systematic review is to identify which information and communication technology features implemented in mobile apps to support asthma self-management are associated with adoption, adherence to usage, and clinical effectiveness. METHODS: We systematically searched 9 databases, scanned reference lists, and undertook manual searches (January 2000 to April 2016). We include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiexperimental studies with adults. All eligible papers were assessed for quality, and we extracted data on the features included, health-related outcomes (asthma control, exacerbation rate), process/intermediate outcomes (adherence to monitoring or treatment, self-efficacy), and level of adoption of and adherence to use of technology. Meta-analysis and narrative synthesis were used. RESULTS: We included 12 RCTs employing a range of technologies. A meta-analysis (n = 3) showed improved asthma control (mean difference -0.25 [95% CI, -0.37 to -0.12]). Included studies incorporated 10 features grouped into 7 categories (education, monitoring/electronic diary, action plans, medication reminders/prompts, facilitating professional support, raising patient awareness of asthma control, and decision support for professionals). The most successful interventions included multiple features, but effects on health-related outcomes were inconsistent. No studies explicitly reported adoption of and adherence to the technology system. CONCLUSION: Meta-analysis of data from 3 trials showed improved asthma control, though overall the clinical effectiveness of apps, typically incorporating multiple features, varied. Further studies are needed to identify the features that are associated with adoption of and adherence to use of the mobile app and those that improve health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) experience abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and defecation‐related anxiety, which can result in reduced productivity and impaired health‐related quality of life (HRQL). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce symptoms of IBS and to improve HRQL, but access to qualified therapists is limited. Smartphone‐based digital therapeutic interventions have potential to increase access to guided CBT at scale, but require careful study to assess their benefits and risks. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel app, Zemedy, as a mobile digital therapeutic that delivers a comprehensive CBT program to individuals with IBS. METHODS: This was a crossover randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited online and randomly allocated to either immediate treatment (n=62) or waitlist control (n=59) groups. The Zemedy app consists of 8 modules focusing on psychoeducation, relaxation training, exercise, the cognitive model of stress management, applying CBT to IBS symptoms, reducing avoidance through exposure therapy, behavioral experiments, and information about diet. Users interact with a chatbot that presents the information and encourages specific plans, homework, and exercises. The treatment was fully automated, with no therapist involvement or communication. At baseline and after 8 weeks, participants were asked to complete the battery of primary (Irritable Bowel Syndrome Quality of Life [IBS‐QOL], Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale [GSRS]) and secondary (Fear of Food Questionnaire [FFQ], Visceral Sensitivity Index [VSI], Gastrointestinal Cognition Questionnaire [GI‐COG], Depression Anxiety Stress Scale [DASS], and Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9]) outcome measures. Waitlist controls were then offered the opportunity to crossover to treatment. All participants were assessed once more at 3 months posttreatment. RESULTS: Both intention‐to‐treat and completer analyses at posttreatment revealed significant improvement for the immediate treatment group compared to the waitlist control group on both primary and secondary outcome measures. Gains were generally maintained at 3 months posttreatment. Scores on the GSRS, IBS‐QoL, GI‐COG, VSI, and FFQ all improved significantly more in the treatment group (F1,79=20.49, P<.001, Cohen d=1.01; F1,79=20.12, P<.001, d=1.25; F1,79=34.71, P<.001, d=1.47; F1,79=18.7, P<.001, d=1.07; and F1,79=12.13, P=.001, d=0.62, respectively). Depression improved significantly as measured by the PHQ‐9 (F1,79=10.5, P=.002, d=1.07), and the DASS Depression (F1,79=6.03, P=.02, d=.83) and Stress (F1,79=4.47, P=.04, d=0.65) subscales in the completer analysis but not in the intention‐to‐treat analysis. The impact of treatment on HRQL was mediated by reductions in catastrophizing and visceral sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its relatively benign physical profile, IBS can be an extraordinarily debilitating condition. Zemedy is an effective modality to deliver CBT for individuals with IBS, and could increase accessibility of this evidence‐based treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones are often vilified for negatively influencing well-being and contributing to stress. However, these devices may, in fact, be useful in times of stress and, in particular, aid in stress recovery. Mobile apps that deliver evidence-based techniques for stress reduction, such as heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB) training, hold promise as convenient, accessible, and effective stress-reducing tools. Numerous mobile health apps that may potentially aid in stress recovery are available, but very few have demonstrated that they can influence health-related physiological stress parameters (eg, salivary biomarkers of stress). The ability to recover swiftly from stress and reduce physiological arousal is particularly important for long-term health, and thus, it is imperative that evidence is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of stress-reducing mobile health apps in this context. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to investigate the physiological and psychological effects of using a smartphone app for HRVB training following a stressful experience. The efficacy of the gamified Breather component of the Happify mobile health app was examined in an experimental setting. METHODS: In this study, participants (N=140) underwent a laboratory stressor and were randomly assigned to recover in one of three ways: with no phone present, with a phone present, with the HRBV game. Those in the no phone condition had no access to their phone. Those in the phone present condition had their phone but did not use it. Those in the HRVB game condition used the serious game Breather on the Happify app. Stress recovery was assessed via repeated measures of salivary alpha amylase, cortisol, and self-reported acute stress (on a 1-100 scale). RESULTS: Participants in the HRVB game condition had significantly lower levels of salivary alpha amylase during recovery than participants in the other conditions (F<sub>2,133</sub>=3.78, P=.03). There were no significant differences among the conditions during recovery for salivary cortisol levels or self-reported stress. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that engaging in a brief HRVB training session on a smartphone reduces levels of salivary alpha amylase following a stressful experience, providing preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of Breather in improving physiological stress recovery. Given the known ties between stress recovery and future well-being, this study provides a possible mechanism by which gamified biofeedback apps may lead to better health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: While self‐administered mobile app‐based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has shown efficiency and effectiveness over the past decade, attempts to address automatic and negative beliefs have been lacking. The purpose of this study was to introduce and verify a mobile app that directly intervenes in dysfunctional thoughts. This app‐based treatment includes recognizing automatic and negative thoughts of the protagonist of scenarios, writing advice directly to the main character, and sharing advice provided by other participants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty‐four participants diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder were recruited and randomly allocated to a CBT‐based mobile‐app program, the Todac Todac (TT group), or a daily mood chart app program (control group). Participants were asked to use the software for 3 weeks. Assessments for autonomic thoughts and clinical symptoms were administered at baseline and at a follow‐up evaluation. RESULTS: After completing the 3‐week program, Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) scores in TT group were lower than they were in the control group. In clinical measures, both TT group and control group showed reduced Beck Depression Inventory‐II (BDI‐II) scores and situation‐dependent trait version of State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI‐X2) at follow‐up. However, TT group showed significantly reduced STAI‐X2 scores compared to control group. For all participants, changes in DAS scores were correlated with BDI‐II and STAI‐X2 scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary findings provide promising evidence that scenario‐based CBT mobile apps can be used to deliver feasible and efficacious cognitive therapy. Long‐term research is needed to determine the impact and effectiveness of this new treatment format.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional face-to-face weight loss and weight control programs are very labor intensive for both the patient and the provider. It is unclear to what extent conventional programs can be (partially) completed by mobile health (mHealth) apps. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different weight loss programs using a combination of conventional and mobile programs among adults who are overweight (body mass index [BMI]>29 kg/m2). METHODS: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial among obese adults was performed from September 2015 to March 2016. The study took place in Leuven, Belgium. Of the 102 eligible (BMI >29 kg/m2) adults, 81 (79%) completed the study. The three intervention groups consisted of a conventional face-to-face weight loss program, a weight loss app program (app group), and a partial face-to-face and partial app program (combi group). All intervention groups received the same advice from a dietician and a physical activity coach during a 12-week period. The control group did not receive any information during the same period. Primary outcomes were weight reduction (5% decrease of baseline weight in kg), BMI, metabolic risk factors, dietary pattern, and physical activity. RESULTS: Significant more participants in all three intervention groups lost at least 5% or more of their weight at baseline compared with the control group. No significant difference was found between the combi group and the conventional group. A trend was found that more participants in the combi group lost 5% or more compared with the app group (19%), P=.06. A significant time x group effect was found for BMI and metabolic risk factors, with the control group having the worst results and the combi group being significantly better with regard to BMI compared with the app group. No significant group x time effects were found for the intake of different food and drinks and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that a conventional weight loss program could partially be completed with an mHealth program without affecting the effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases have recently had an increasing effect on maternal-fetal health, especially in high-income countries. However, there remains a lack of discussion regarding health management with technological approaches, including mobile health (mHealth) interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate mHealth interventions used in pregnancy in high-income countries and their effects on maternal health behaviors and maternal-fetal health outcomes. METHODS: This systematic review identified studies published between January 1, 2000, and November 30, 2018, in MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and gray literature. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included only pregnant women in high-income countries and evaluated stand-alone mobile phone interventions intended to promote healthy maternal beliefs, behaviors, and/or maternal-fetal health outcomes. Two researchers independently reviewed and categorized aspects of full-text articles, including source, study design, intervention and control, duration, participant age, attrition rate, main outcomes, and risk of bias. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed, and the study was registered in PROSPERO before initiation. RESULTS: Of the 2225 records examined, 28 studies were included and categorized into 4 themes: (1) gestational weight gain, obesity and physical activity (n=9); (2) smoking cessation (n=9); (3) influenza vaccination (n=2); and (4) general prenatal health, preventive strategies, and miscellaneous topics (n=8). Reported sample sizes ranged from 16 to 5243 with a median of 91. Most studies were performed in the United States (18/28, 64%) and were randomized controlled trials (21/28, 75%). All participants in the included studies were pregnant at the time of study initiation. Overall, 14% (4/28) of studies showed association between intervention use and improved health outcomes; all 4 studies focused on healthy gestational weight. Among those, 3 studies showed intervention use was associated with less overall gestational weight gain. These 3 studies involved interventions with text messaging or an app in combination with another communication strategy (Facebook or email). Regarding smoking cessation, influenza vaccination, and miscellaneous topics, there was some evidence of positive effects on health behaviors and beliefs, but very limited correlation with improved health outcomes. Data and interventions were heterogeneous, precluding a meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In high-income countries, utilization of mobile phone-based health behavior interventions in pregnancy demonstrates some correlation with positive beliefs, behaviors, and health outcomes. More effective interventions are multimodal in terms of features and tend to focus on healthy gestational weight gain.

AB  - Improving mental healthcare using mobile apps might be an effective way to increase interest in mental health and respond to the demand for better psychological health. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of app‐based stress‐management programs. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an app‐based stress‐management program. A non‐equivalent comparison group pretest‐posttest design was used. Participants were randomized into the experimental (n = 26) and control (n = 30) groups. The experimental group used an application developed for workers for four weeks. The results indicated that stress, emotional labor, self‐efficacy, and well‐being were significantly different in the experimental group, but the control groupâ€™s average scores did not change significantly. On average, the Perceived Stress Scale scores decreased by 1.5 points (p = 0.035) and the Korean Occupational Stress Scale scores decreased by 0.87 points (p = 0.4). However, depression and anxiety were not significantly different. Emotional labor decreased by 0.16 points (p = 0.027), and well‐being and self‐efficacy mean scores increased by 0.492 (p = 0.005) and 0.162 (p = 0.025), respectively. These findings support the developed applicationâ€™s value for promoting mental health and healthy lifestyles. Further research and supplementation are needed for the applicationâ€™s sustainability.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a disease that causes a lot of suffering. It becomes a hurdle in everyday life. Asthma self‐care program through mobile Line application (SALA) might be a good choice to help resolving this problem. Objective: To evaluate effectiveness of SALA program among asthma patients. Materials and Methods: The present study was a randomized controlled trial. The study sample consisted of 62 participants aged between 20 to 60 years with mild to moderate asthma. The study sample were randomly assigned to intervention plus usual care (intervention group, n=31) or usual care (control group, n=31) by computer generated. SALA program was sent to participants once a week for two months through their mobile phone, drug reminder appointment date for four months. The study period was six months. Clinical record form and Questionnaire were adapted to collect the demographic data and lung function via spirometer as FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, ACS, knowledge, attitude, and self‐management. Mini Asthma Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire was used to collect the data. Intention to treat (ITT), Repeated ANOVA, and General Linear model were statistical technique used to analyze the data. Results: Data from 60 asthma patients were available for analyses. The baseline characteristics of both groups were not significantly different. There were statistically significant mean differences in between the groups at three and six months. The mean difference in the following variables were FEV1 13.83 (5.01 to 22.65) FVC, 13.36 (2.62 to 24.09) FEV1/FVC, 11.65 (4.8 to 18.49), PEFR 9.85 (0.03 to 19.67), ACS 2.45 (0.62 to 4.27), knowledge 2.64 (0.81 to 4.46), and self‐management 4.26 (2.00 to 6.52). Conclusion: SALA improved knowledge, self‐management, asthma status, and lung function among asthma patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minorities have an increased incidence of early‐onset, obesity‐related cerebrovascular disease. Unfortunately, effective weight management in this vulnerable population has significant barriers. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the feasibility and preliminary treatment effects of a smartphone‐based weight loss intervention versus food journals to monitor dietary patterns in minority stroke patients. METHODS: Swipe out Stroke was a pilot prospective randomized controlled trial with open blinded end point. Minority stroke patients and their caregivers were screened for participation using cluster enrollment. We used adaptive randomization for assignment to a behavior intervention with (1) smartphone‐based self‐monitoring or (2) food journal self‐monitoring. The smartphone group used Lose it! to record meals and communicate with us. Reminder messages (first 30 days), weekly summaries plus reminder messages on missed days (days 31‐90), and weekly summaries only (days 91‐180) were sent via push notifications. The food journal group used paper diaries. Both groups received 4 in‐person visits (baseline and 30, 90, and 180 days), culturally competent counseling, and educational materials. The primary outcome was reduced total body weight. RESULTS: We enrolled 36 stroke patients (n=23, 64% African American; n=13, 36% Hispanic), 17 in the smartphone group, and 19 in the food journal group. Mean age was 54 (SD 9) years; mean body mass index was 35.7 (SD 5.7) kg/m2; education, employment status, and family history of stroke or obesity did not differ between the groups. Baseline rates of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 [PHQ‐9] score median 5.5, IQR 3.0‐9.5), cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score median 23.5, IQR 21‐26), and inability to ambulate (5/36, 14% with modified Rankin Scale score 3) were similar. In total, 25 (69%) stroke survivors completed Swipe out Stroke (13/17 in the smartphone group, 12/19 in the food journal group); 1 participant in the smartphone group died. Median weight change at 180 days was 5.7 lb (IQR ‐2.4 to 8.0) in the smartphone group versus 6.4 lb (IQR ‐2.2 to 12.5; P=.77) in the food journal group. Depression was significantly lower at 30 days in the smartphone group than in the food journal group (PHQ‐9 score 2 vs 8; P=.03). Clinically relevant depression rates remained in the zero to minimal range for the smartphone group compared with mild to moderate range in the food journal group at day 90 (PHQ‐9 score 3.5 vs 4.5; P=.39) and day 180 (PHQ‐9 score 3 vs 6; P=.12). CONCLUSIONS: In a population of obese minority stroke survivors, the use of a smartphone did not lead to a significant difference in weight change compared with keeping a food journal. The presence of baseline depression (19/36, 53%) was a confounding variable, which improved with app engagement. Future studies that include treatment of poststroke depression may positively influence intervention efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone applications could improve symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) in a scalable and resource-efficient manner in the context limited access to specialized care. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of applications designed as treatment interventions for adults with symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in BPD. DATA SOURCES: Search terms for BPD symptoms, smartphone applications, and treatment interventions were combined on PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO from database inception to December 2019. STUDY SELECTION: Controlled and uncontrolled studies of smartphone interventions for adult participants with symptoms such as anger, suicidality, or self-harm that commonly occur in BPD were included. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v3 was used to compute between-groups effect sizes in controlled designs. The primary outcome was BPD-related symptoms such as anger, suicidality, and impulsivity; and the secondary outcome was general psychopathology. An average dropout rate across interventions was computed. Study quality, target audiences, therapeutic approach and targets, effectiveness, intended use, usability metrics, availability on market, and downloads were assessed qualitatively from the papers and through internet search. RESULTS: Twelve studies of 10 applications were included, reporting data from 408 participants. Between-groups meta-analyses of RCTs revealed no significant effect of smartphone applications above and beyond in-person treatments or a waitlist on BPD symptoms (Hedges' g = - 0.066, 95% CI [-.257, .125]), nor on general psychopathology (Hedges' g = 0.305, 95% CI [- 0.14, 0.75]). Across the 12 trials, dropout rates ranged from 0 to 56.7% (M = 22.5, 95% CI [0.15, 0.46]). A majority of interventions studied targeted emotion dysregulation and behavioral dyscontrol symptoms. Half of the applications are commercially available. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of smartphone interventions on symptoms of BPD are unclear and there is currently a lack of evidence for their effectiveness. More research is needed to build on these preliminary findings in BPD to investigate both positive and adverse effects of smartphone applications and identify the role these technologies may provide in expanding mental healthcare resources.

AB  - With stress in modern life becoming such an epidemic, the goal of identifying behavioural interventions that reduce the intensity of acute-stress responses has never been more important. Using a randomized experimental design, we examined whether playing a simple, familiar melody on the iPhone for 10 minutes would facilitate stress recovery in a group of undergraduate students who were non-musicians. We instructed 54 participants to play "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" using the Smule Ocarina app on the iPhone which involved blowing into the microphone of the iPhone and placing fingers on the screen to produce different notes. One week after receiving instruction, participants were randomly assigned to either an acute-stress induction procedure or a no-stress control group. The acute-stress group exhibited elevations in levels of cortisol as well as negative mood and arousal (as measured by two self-report measures of mood and arousal), compared to the no-stress group. Participants in both groups were subsequently randomly assigned to one of three 10-minute-long activities: playing or listening to "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" on the iPhone Ocarina, or sitting in silence. Participants who had undergone the stress-inducing procedure and who played or listened to the ocarina during the stress-recovery period showed significant decreases in cortisol levels compared to those who sat in silence. However, as expected, participants in the no-stress group who played the iPhone Ocarina showed significant increases in cortisol levels relative to participants who listened to it or sat in silence. The implications associated with using digital technology in music therapy for acute-stress interventions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many people intend to eat healthily, they often fail to do so. We report the first randomised trial testing whether smartphone‐based support groups can enhance healthy eating. METHODS: Adults (N = 203) were randomised to the support or control condition (information), and to one of two eating goals (increasing fruit and vegetable/decreasing unhealthy snack consumption). After baseline, participants received information on their assigned eating goal, and completed a 13‐day electronic diary. During Days 4‐10, support participants were asked to support each other in achieving their eating goal in smartphone‐based groups. The primary outcome was daily servings of fruit/vegetables or unhealthy snacks. Maintenance of intervention effects was assessed on Days 11‐13, and at 1‐month and 2‐month follow‐ups. RESULTS: Support participants showed a gradual increase in healthy eating over time, and ate 1.4 fruits and vegetables more, 95% CI [0.3, 2.6], or 0.8 unhealthy snacks less, 95% CI [‐1.4, ‐0.2] than controls on Day 10. Most effects were not maintained at follow‐ups. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone‐based groups can promote fruit and vegetable consumption and decrease unhealthy snack intake. This study extends previous findings of the benefits of support groups, and sheds light on the temporal dynamics of behavior change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Mobile phones have become ubiquitous in most developed societies. Smartphone apps, telemonitoring, and clinician-driven SMS allow for novel opportunities and methods in managing chronic CVD, such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and hypertension, and in the conduct and support of cardiac rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was conducted using seven electronic databases, identifying all relevant randomized control trials (RCTs) featuring a mobile phone intervention (MPI) used in the management of chronic CVD. Outcomes assessed included mortality, hospitalizations, blood pressure (BP), and BMI. METHODS: Electronic data searches were performed using seven databases from January 2000 to June 2019. Relevant articles were reviewed and analyzed. Meta-analysis was performed using standard techniques. The odds ratio (OR) was used as a summary statistic for dichotomous variables. A random effect model was used. RESULTS: A total of 26 RCTs including 6713 patients were identified and are described in this review, and 12 RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. In patients with heart failure, MPIs were associated with a significantly lower rate of hospitalizations (244/792, 30.8% vs 287/803, 35.7%; n=1595; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.97; P=.03; I2=0%). In patients with hypertension, patients exposed to MPIs had a significantly lower systolic BP (mean difference 4.3 mm Hg; 95% CI -7.8 to -0.78 mm Hg; n=2023; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest that MPIs may have a role as a valuable adjunct in the management of chronic CVD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Many individuals are advised to adhere to specific diet plans for their personal health; hence, it is important that tools are available to support these behaviors. Smartphone applications (apps) may assist health care professionals in educating their clients on specific dietary modifications. This pilot study focused on a single dietary modification, reducing sodium intake, to determine whether a commercial health app is useful for promoting dietary change. METHODS: Thirty healthy adults (age 34.4 ± 15.7 y; body mass index 25.6 ± 4.3 kg/m2) were recruited from a university community and completed this 4‐wk randomized parallel trial. Participants were instructed to reduce their sodium intake to ≤2300 mg/d by using the MyFitnessPal app to receive feedback on sodium content of foods or by paper tallying of estimated sodium intake. The predicted 24‐h sodium excretion, estimated using the ratio of sodium to creatinine from the first morning urine void, and participant satisfaction were the main outcomes measured. RESULTS: The change in the predicted 24‐h sodium excretion differed between groups: ‐838 ± 1093 and +236 ± 1333 mg/24 h predicted for the app and journal groups, respectively (P = 0.010). Moreover, participants in the app group reported significantly greater satisfaction with their method of diet tracking than the journal group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that smartphone apps have the potential to facilitate the implementation of dietary advice. This was a small pilot study with limited scope, and more research is necessary to determine the value of smartphone apps for facilitating dietary change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions aimed at modifying behavior for promoting health and disease management are traditionally resource intensive and difficult to scale. Mobile health apps are being used for these purposes; however, their effects on health outcomes have been mixed. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize the evidence of rigorously evaluated health-related apps on health outcomes and explore the effects of features present in studies that reported a statistically significant difference in health outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in 7 databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews). A total of 5 reviewers independently screened and extracted the study characteristics. We used a random-effects model to calculate the pooled effect size estimates for meta-analysis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted based on follow-up time, stand-alone app interventions, level of personalization, and pilot studies. Logistic regression was used to examine the structure of app features. RESULTS: From the database searches, 8230 records were initially identified. Of these, 172 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were predominantly conducted in high-income countries (164/172, 94.3%). The majority had follow-up periods of 6 months or less (143/172, 83.1%). Over half of the interventions were delivered by a stand-alone app (106/172, 61.6%). Static/one-size-fits-all (97/172, 56.4%) was the most common level of personalization. Intervention frequency was daily or more frequent for the majority of the studies (123/172, 71.5%). A total of 156 studies involving 21,422 participants reported continuous health outcome data. The use of an app to modify behavior (either as a stand-alone or as part of a larger intervention) confers a slight/weak advantage over standard care in health interventions (standardized mean difference=0.38 [95% CI 0.31-0.45]; I2=80%), although heterogeneity was high. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in the literature demonstrates a steady increase in the rigorous evaluation of apps aimed at modifying behavior to promote health and manage disease. Although the literature is growing, the evidence that apps can improve health outcomes is weak. This finding may reflect the need for improved methodological and evaluative approaches to the development and assessment of health care improvement apps.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and lack of physical activity are major health risk factors for many life-threatening diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. The use of mobile app interventions to promote weight loss and boost physical activity among children and adults is fascinating owing to the demand for cutting-edge and more efficient interventions. Previously published studies have examined different types of technology-based interventions and their impact on weight loss and increase in physical activity, but evidence regarding the impact of only a mobile phone app on weight loss and increase in physical activity is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a mobile phone app intervention for reducing body weight and increasing physical activity among children and adults. METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Web of Science electronic databases were searched for studies published between January 1, 2000, and April 30, 2019, without language restrictions. Two experts independently screened all the titles and abstracts to find the most appropriate studies. To be included, studies had to be either a randomized controlled trial or a case-control study that assessed a mobile phone app intervention with body weight loss and physical activity outcomes. The Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool was used to examine the risk of publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies involving a mobile phone app intervention were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, the use of a mobile phone app was associated with significant changes in body weight (-1.07 kg, 95% CI -1.92 to -0.21, P=.01) and body mass index (-0.45 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.12, P=.008). Moreover, a nonsignificant increase in physical activity was observed (0.17, 95% CI -2.21 to 2.55, P=.88). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate the promising and emerging efficacy of using mobile phone app interventions for weight loss. Future studies are needed to explore the long-term efficacy of mobile app interventions in larger samples.

AB  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can be effective in treating anxiety disorders, yet there has been no study on Internet‐delivered ACT for social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder (PD), nor any study investigating whether therapist guidance is superior to unguided self‐help when supplemented with a smartphone application. In the current trial, n=152 participants diagnosed with SAD and/or PD were randomized to therapist‐guided or unguided treatment, or a waiting‐list control group. Both treatment groups used an Internet‐delivered ACT‐based treatment program and a smartphone application. Outcome measures were self‐rated general and social anxiety and panic symptoms. Treatment groups saw reduced general (d=0.39) and social anxiety (d=0.70), but not panic symptoms (d=0.05) compared to the waiting‐list group, yet no differences in outcomes were observed between guided and unguided interventions. We conclude that Internet‐delivered ACT is appropriate for treating SAD and potentially PD. Smartphone applications may partially compensate for lack of therapist support.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High blood pressure or hypertension is one of the chronic diseases causing other serious diseases and syndromes. Active involvement of the patient in the management of the disease is crucial in improving self-care and clinical outcomes. Mobile technology is nowadays used widely to improve the self-care process in people with chronic diseases such as hypertension. AIM: The objective of this study was to provide an overview of the existing research evaluating the impact of mobile applications on the self-care of patients with hypertension. METHODS: The Scopus and PubMed databases were investigated using a comprehensive search strategy from the beginning of 2010 to 2019. All controlled clinical trial studies as well as quasi-experimental studies used mobile as a device for improving the self-care and conducted on patients with hypertension were included in the study. The studies were reviewed by two independent individuals. RESULTS: Out of 1032 studies found, 6 studies were finally reviewed after applying the inclusion criteria. Out of 6 studies reviewed, three studies confirmed the effect of using mobile applications on lowering blood pressure. Other studies reported a decline in blood pressure, while statistically significant were not shown. CONCLUSION: The results showed that mobile apps have positive potential on improving the self-care behavior of patients with hypertension, but the evidences presenting their impact are varied. Different reports for efficiency of mobile phone apps for the self-care modification was due to diverse condition of studies for mobile intervention on the patients with hypertension.

AB  - Current treatments for smoking yield suboptimal outcomes, partly because of an inability to reduce cue‐induced smoking. Mindfulness training (MT) has shown preliminary efficacy for smoking cessation, yet its neurobiological target remains unknown. Our prior work with nonsmokers indicates that MT reduces posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity. In individuals who smoke, the PCC, consistently a main hub of the “default mode network,” activates in response to smoking cues. In this randomized controlled trial, we tested the effects of app‐delivered MT on PCC reactivity to smoking cues and whether individual differences in MT‐mediated PCC changes predicted smoking outcomes. Smoking cue‐induced PCC reactivity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and 1 month after receiving smartphone app‐based MT (n = 33) vs. an active control (National Cancer Institute’s QuitGuide, n = 34). Whether individual differences in treatment‐related changes in PCC activity predicted smoking behavior was assessed. The MT group demonstrated a significant correlation between a reduction in PCC reactivity to smoking cues and a decline in cigarette consumption (r = 0.39, p = 0.02). No association was found in the control group (r = 0.08, p = 0.65). No effects of group alone were found in PCC or cigarette reduction. Post hoc analysis revealed this association is sex specific (women, r = 0.49, p = 0.03; men: r = −0.08, p = 0.79). This initial report indicates that MT specifically reduces smoking cue‐induced PCC activity in a subject‐specific manner, and the reduction in PCC activity predicts a concurrent decline in smoking. These findings link the hypothesized behavioral effects of MT for smoking to neural mechanisms particularly in women. This lays the groundwork for identifying individuals who may benefit from targeted digital therapeutic treatments such as smartphone‐based MT, yielding improved clinical outcomes.

AB  - Background: Attention deficit is a growing problem in adults, and early diagnosis and treatment are needed. Previous studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective in improving attention deficit symptoms. However, many patients are not receiving adequate treatment due to time, space, and cost constraints. Recently, in other mental illnesses, mobile‐based chatbots delivering CBT and psychoeducation have been used for symptom mitigation and treatment. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and usability of a short‐term intervention, specifically a mobile‐based interactive chatbot application, in alleviating attention deficit symptoms. Methods: This was a randomized, non‐blind parallel‐group pilot study conducted from September 2019 to March 2020. Forty‐six individuals with attention deficit aged 19–60 were randomly allocated to the chatbot (n = 23) and information‐only control groups (n = 23) for 4 weeks. The former group was instructed to use the chatbot application “Todaki,” while the latter group was provided with a book on managing attention deficit symptoms. Participants were administered questionnaires to assess their symptoms of attention deficit, depression, and anxiety and evaluated at baseline and 4 weeks after the intervention. The post‐intervention survey assessed the chatbot's usability, acceptability, and side effects. Results: The average age of the participants was 25.1 years (standard deviation [SD] 7.5 years), and 56.5 % (26/46) participants were female. Intention‐to‐treat analysis (chatbot, n = 23; control, n = 23) revealed a significant reduction of attention deficit symptoms only in the chatbot group, which is represented by group‐by‐time interaction in Conner's Adult ADHD Rating Scale subscales of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual‐IV Attention‐Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Hyperactive‐Impulsive symptoms (F = 4.39; p =.04) and ADHD symptoms total (F = 6.74, p =.01). Further, the results of the paired t‐test were significant only in the chatbot group. The average number of times the chatbots were used in 4 weeks was 20.32 (SD 12.89). The total average usage time was 1 h 15 min (SD 1 h 20 min). The degree of improvement in the ADHD symptoms total score was correlated with the number of times the psychoeducation program was used. According to the participants, the empathic/friendly character and unnatural flow of conversation were the best and worst features of the chatbot, respectively. Conclusions: This study identified the feasibility and usability of using the mobile‐based chatbot to improve attention deficit and its associated psychiatric symptoms. Using this novel intervention to conduct CBT would provide a useful digital therapeutic tool that allows easy accessibility and self‐guided management for people with attention deficit, which should be verified through the large scale randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of mobile phone applications (App) based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on postpartum depression. Method: A non‐blinded parallel‐group randomized controlled trial was conducted. The study population consisted of women attended to three health care centers in Kerman, Iran. Participants were recruited between September and November 2018, and randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group (mobile application access) or control group (no mobile application access). All participants completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at the baseline and 2 months after baseline. Data were analyzed using inferential statistics including chi‐square, independent sample t‐test, paired t‐test and linear regression. Results: A total of 75 women with an average age of 27 years participated in this study. Before the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference between the EPDS score between the two groups (p > 0.001). However, in the intervention group, the average EPDS score after intervention was 8.18 and in the control group was 15.05, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: These findings provide proof that providing a CBT program using a mobile application can lead to clinically important improvements in outcomes for mothers who suffer from postpartum depression.

AB  - AIM: To verify the usefulness of a smartphone application (App) for facilitating self‐care in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). BACKGROUND: CHB is a global health problem, and patients with CHB need to routinely perform self‐care. Health‐related smartphone apps could help users self‐manage their disease. METHODS: Fifty‐three CHB patients were assessed in this randomized controlled before‐and‐after experimental study. The patients were randomly and equally assigned to groups that did (n=26) or did not (n=27) use the smartphone app for 12weeks. The experimental and control groups were analyzed for differences in disease knowledge, self‐efficacy, and self‐care before and after use of the smartphone app. RESULTS: After intervention, patients who used the app displayed significantly increased disease knowledge compared with the control group (p=.015). Self‐efficacy and self‐care also significantly increased in the experimental group (p=0.006 and 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The smartphone app can be useful for increasing self‐care in CHB patients. ABBREVIATIONS: App: application, CHB: chronic hepatitis B, CVI: content validity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although important, heart failure self‐care remains a challenge for many patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a nurse‐led, home‐based self‐management psychosocial education intervention (HOM‐HEMP). The primary outcome was patient's HF self‐care in terms of maintenance, management and confidence. The secondary outcomes were cardiac self‐efficacy, psychological wellbeing in terms of perceived social support, health related quality of life and levels of anxiety and depression. The clinical outcomes included New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class and numbers of unplanned health service visits due to cardiac‐related reasons. DESIGN: A three‐arm stratified randomized controlled trial was conducted (Clinical trial registration number: NCT03108235). METHODS: A total of 213 participants admitted for heart failure were recruited from the inpatient wards of a tertiary public hospital in Singapore. They were randomly allocated to the control group, the experimental group A or the experimental group B. All participants received the usual care provided by the hospital. Participants in experimental groups A and B received the HOM‐HEMP intervention, and those in experimental group B received an additional supplemental smartphone application. Data were collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months from baseline. RESULTS: Compared to the control groups, participants in either of the experimental group had significantly higher levels of heart failure self‐care maintenance (F = 4.222, p = 0.001), self‐care confidence (F = 5.796, p < 0.001) and self‐care management (p < 0.05) at 6‐week, 3‐month and 6‐month follow‐ups. In addition, both experimental groups had significantly higher levels of cardiac self‐efficacy, better health related quality of life and lower depression levels than the control group after the study intervention. A higher proportion of participants in both experimental groups had a better New York Heart Association functional class at 6‐week and 3‐month follow‐ups. Participants in the experimental group B also had significantly fewer cardiac‐related unplanned hospital admissions and emergency room visits than the control group at 6‐month follow‐up. Results on perceived social support were not significant. The study outcomes in experimental group A and B were not significantly different at any of the post intervention follow‐up. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested that HOM‐HEMP is an effective intervention for patients with heart failure in Singapore.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic physical conditions (CPCs) decrease the quality of life of millions of people. In the absence of curative treatments, maintaining healthy lifestyle habits is one of the main pillars in their clinical management. Mobile-based interventions may help patients take care of their health and follow medical recommendations. The purpose of this review is to summarize the latest evidence about mobile phone applications (apps) for the management of CPC. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify articles that explored apps for the management of CPCs, testing the apps empirically, and providing clear outputs on effectiveness and/or feasibility. 3528 articles were identified in the initial search. Following screening and selection process, 20 articles were finally included in the review. RESULTS: Mobile apps for CPC are very heterogeneous. The condition with the greater number of apps available was diabetes, followed by cardiovascular diseases. Results of feasibility were generally positive, with high rates of study completion and user engagement. Some studies used incentives, monetary of otherwise. Some of the apps have been tested in randomized clinical trials showing effectiveness in improving symptoms and/or controlling analytical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile apps are promising tools for the management of CPCs. Some apps have been sufficiently tested to propose their implementation in clinical practice. However, several barriers exist that can slow down the routine use of new technologies in healthcare settings. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the main interventions to reduce the use of health resources, and it promotes a reduction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) costs. mHealth systems in COPD aim to improve adherence to maintenance programs after pulmonary rehabilitation by promoting the change in attitude and behavior necessary for patient involvement in the management of the disease. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effects of an integrated care plan based on an mHealth web‐based platform (HappyAir) on adherence to a 1‐year maintenance program applied after pulmonary rehabilitation in COPD patients. METHODS: COPD patients from three hospitals were randomized to a control group or an intervention group (HappyAir group). Patients from both groups received an 8‐week program of pulmonary rehabilitation and educational sessions about their illness. After completion of the process, only the HappyAir group completed an integrated care plan for 10 months, supervised by an mHealth system and therapeutic educator. The control group only underwent the scheduled check‐ups. Adherence to the program was rated using a respiratory physiotherapy adherence self‐report (CAP FISIO) questionnaire. Other variables analyzed were adherence to physical activity (Morisky‐Green Test), quality of life (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and EuroQOL‐5D), exercise capacity (6‐Minute Walk Test), and lung function. RESULTS: In total, 44 patients were recruited and randomized in the control group (n=24) and HappyAir group (n=20). Eight patients dropped out for various reasons. The CAP FISIO questionnaire results showed an improvement in adherence during follow‐up period for the HappyAir group, which was statistically different compared with the control group at 12 months (56.1 [SD 4.0] vs 44.0 [SD 13.6]; P=.004) after pulmonary rehabilitation. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth systems designed for COPD patients improve adherence to maintenance programs as long as they are accompanied by disease awareness and patient involvement in management.

AB  - Background. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin condition where nonadherence often results in lack of disease control. Objective. We wanted to determine whether the combination of an electronic memory button and a supportive application (app) would affect the Quality of Life and subjective and objective severity measures among AD patients over one month following the patient's normal schedules of treatment. Methods. A randomized, investigator‐blinded, prospective observational feasibility study for one month where patients diagnosed with AD were randomized based on POEM severity score and divided into 3 groups. The 3 groups were (1) the control group with two consultations, (2) in addition to group 1, patients also received electronic memory buttons to click every time they used their topical products, and (3) in addition to group 2, patients also received an app to track their treatment schedules. At both consultations, patients were evaluated using SCORAD, EASI, POEM, and DLQI. Results. 96 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 83 patients completed the study. EASI and SCORAD scores were lower in all groups at 2nd consultation (p<0.05); however, these were highly significant for group 3 (p<0.005), and for EASI between groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). The POEM score decreased significantly in group 3 (p=0.024), and no difference was found in DLQI between visits. Conclusion. A reduction in severity following objective assessments of the AD was observed for all groups and was highly significant for patients offered a memory button and the corresponding app. Furthermore, patients reported a significant subjective beneficial effect if they used the memory button and app. This indicates that digital solutions may have a benefit in clinical practice and may reduce nonadherence and increase the wellbeing of the patients.

AB  - Background The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians refer obese adults for intensive, multicomponent behavioral counseling, yet most obese Americans choose a self‐help approach to lose weight. The current study examined weight loss between a community‐based, intensive behavioral counseling program (Weight Watchers program) and a self‐help condition. Methods A total of 292 participants were randomized to either a Weight Watchers condition (WW) (n = 147) or a self‐help condition (n = 145). Participants in the WW condition were provided with 3 ways to access the treatment: weekly meetings; WW mobile application; and WW online tools. Weights were measured at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Additionally, self‐report use of access modes was collected at 3 and 6 months. Results Participants in the WW condition significantly decreased their body mass index at 6 months (F = 36.7, P <.001) and were 8.0 and 8.8 times more likely to achieve a 5% and 10% reduction in weight, respectively, compared with those in the self‐help condition. In a secondary analysis, high usage of all 3 access modes resulted in the greatest weight loss (P <.001). Conclusion Use of the WW program yielded significantly greater weight loss than a self‐help approach, suggesting it is a viable community‐based provider of weight loss treatment, as recommended by the USPSTF. Further, high usage of 3 access modes was associated with greater weight loss results. 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Patients with myocardial infarction (MI) seldom reach recommended targets for secondary prevention. This study evaluated a smartphone application ("app") aimed at improving treatment adherence and cardiovascular lifestyle in MI patients. Design Multicenter, randomized trial. Methods A total of 174 ticagrelor‐treated MI patients were randomized to either an interactive patient support tool (active group) or a simplified tool (control group) in addition to usual post‐MI care. Primary end point was a composite nonadherence score measuring patient‐registered ticagrelor adherence, defined as a combination of adherence failure events (2 missed doses registered in 7‐day cycles) and treatment gaps (4 consecutive missed doses). Secondary end points included change in cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life (European Quality of Life‐5 Dimensions), and patient device satisfaction (System Usability Scale). Results Patient mean age was 58 years, 81% were men, and 21% were current smokers. At 6 months, greater patient‐registered drug adherence was achieved in the active vs the control group (nonadherence score: 16.6 vs 22.8 [P =.025]). Numerically, the active group was associated with higher degree of smoking cessation, increased physical activity, and change in quality of life; however, this did not reach statistical significance. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the active vs the control group (system usability score: 87.3 vs 78.1 [P =.001]). Conclusions In MI patients, use of an interactive patient support tool improved patient self‐reported drug adherence and may be associated with a trend toward improved cardiovascular lifestyle changes and quality of life. Use of a disease‐specific interactive patient support tool may be an appreciated, simple, and promising complement to standard secondary prevention.

AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe hemoglobinopathy characterized by acute and chronic pain. Sufferers of the disease, most of whom are underrepresented minorities, are at increased risk for mental health disorders. The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability and implementation of a computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) intervention, Beating the Blues, to improve depression, anxiety, and pain in patients with SCD. Adults with SCD and significant symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ‐9] score >/= 10) or anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD‐7] score >/= 10) were eligible to participate and be randomized to either receive eight sessions of cCBT with care coach support or treatment as usual. Participants reported daily pain and mood symptoms using a mobile diary app. Depression, anxiety, and pain symptoms were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months. Thirty patients were enrolled: 18 to cCBT, and 12 to control. The cCBT intervention was feasible to implement in clinical settings and acceptable to participants. Patients in the cCBT arm reported a marginally greater decrease in depression at 6 months (‐3.82, SE = 1.30) than those in the control group (‐0.50, SE = 1.60; p = .06). There were no significant effects of treatment on anxiety; however, cCBT was associated with improved daily pain reported via a mobile diary app (p = .014). cCBT, delivered via mobile device, is a feasible strategy to provide mental health care to adults living with SCD. cCBT was acceptable to the target population; was able to be implemented in real‐world, nonideal conditions; and has the potential to improve patient‐reported outcomes.

AB  - Applications (apps) for mobile digital devices offer a logical, convenient, more methodologically sound alternative to traditional paper and pencil methods for self-recording food intake and appetite sensations. Although food-monitoring apps are widely available to the general public, there are no known apps for recording appetite levels. Moreover, despite their frequent use in treatment and clinical research, we still know very little about the relative reactive effects of these two types of self-monitoring, or the extent to which individuals consider these self-monitoring techniques acceptable or useful. This study evaluated the feasibility, relative acceptability, and relative reactive effects of two novel apps for mobile digital devices for electronically recording food intake and appetite sensations. Eighty-seven women with weight and shape concerns were randomly assigned to monitor either their appetite levels ( n=46) or food intake (n=41) for 3 weeks, using an application (app) and a mobile digital device. Contrary to what had been predicted, both groups had similarly high rates of compliance, as measured by total number of days monitored. As hypothesized, both forms of electronic self-monitoring produced similar significant reductions in eating pathology overall. Contrary to our hypothesis, individuals assigned to electronically monitor their appetite did not report greater reductions in food and weight preoccupation or general eating pathology, compared to individuals who electronically monitored their daily food intake, nor did individuals in the appetite monitoring condition report increased interoceptive awareness. However, at post-test, individuals in the food monitoring group reported higher concerns over eating, deprivation, and tendency to restrict food intake, compared to those in the appetite monitoring condition. Moreover, at post-test, participants who monitored their appetite rated their experience as having been more positive than those who monitored food intake.

AB  - Objective: Nonadherence in diabetes is a problem leading to wasted resources and preventable deaths each year. Remedies for diminishing nonadherence are many but marginally effective, and outcomes remain suboptimal. Aim: The aim of this study was to test a new iOS "app", PatientPartner. Derived from complexity theory, this novel technology has been extensively used in other fields; this is the first trial in a patient population. Methods: Physicians referred patients who were "severely non‐adherent" with HbA1c levels >8. After consent and random assignment (n=107), subjects in the intervention group were immersed in the 12‐min PatientPartner game, which assesses and trains subjects on parameters of thinking that are critical for good decision making in health care: information management, stress coping, and health strategies. The control group did not play PatientPartner. All subjects were called each week for 3 weeks and self‐reported on their medication adherence, diet, and exercise. Baseline and 3‐month post‐intervention HbA1c levels were recorded for the intervention group. Results: Although the control group showed no difference on any measures at 3 weeks, the intervention group reported significant mean percentage improvements on all measures: medication adherence (57%, standard deviation [SD] 18%‐96%, SD 9), diet (50%, SD 33%‐75%, SD 28), and exercise (29%, SD 31%‐43%, SD 33). At 3 months, the mean HbA1c levels in the intervention group were significantly lower (9.6) than baseline (10.7). Conclusion: Many programs to improve adherence have been proved to be expensive and marginally effective. Therefore, improvements from the single use of a 12‐min‐long "app" are noteworthy. This is the first ever randomized, controlled trial to demonstrate that an "app" can impact the gold standard biological marker, HbA1c, in diabetes. Copyright © 2017 Joshi et al.

AB  - Background: A smartphone application (i.e., SPSRS) was developed to help people with subthreshold depression (StD) improve depressive symptoms by presenting positive word stimuli in videos. However, to date, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to investigate SPSRS application interventions for depressive symptoms in people with StD. Therefore, a pilot RCT was conducted to assess the preliminary efficacy of the SPSRS application intervention for people with StD. Methods: In a pilot RCT, 32 participants (female = 34.4%, mean age = 20.06, SD = 1.24) with StD were randomized to SPSRS application intervention for approximately 10 min/a day for 5 weeks (experimental group; n = 16) or no intervention (wait list control group; n = 16). The primary outcome is the change from baseline in the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES‐D) score after the 5‐week intervention. The secondary outcomes are the change from baseline in the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K‐6) score and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7‐item scale (GAD‐7) after the 5‐week intervention. Results: No participants dropped out of the study. The experimental group displayed medium, small, and small improvements in CES‐D, K‐6, and GAD‐7 scores (adjusted Hedge's g = −0.64, −0.29, and −0.40), respectively, compared with control. Limitations: The observed effects must be considered preliminary due to the small sample size. Conclusions: The results suggest the potential of intervention using the SPSRS application to reduce depressive symptoms in people with StD. Future studies should replicate these findings in a full‐scale RCT.

AB  - Obesity is partly driven by unhealthy food choices underpinned by cognitive biases, including approach bias (a tendency to move towards food cues) and delay discounting (a preference for immediate rewards). Cognitive training strategies aimed at modifying these biases, namely, approach‐avoidance training (AAT) and episodic future thinking (EFT), may improve food choice. This pilot randomised trial examined the effect of these two trainings, delivered daily for 1 week via smartphone apps, on approach bias for healthy/unhealthy foods, delay discounting for money/food, and hypothetical food choice. Sixty overweight/obese participants (18‐45 years) were randomly allocated to AAT, EFT, or control. Outcomes were measured at pretraining, posttraining, and 6‐week follow‐up. AAT reduced approach bias for unhealthy food and increased healthy food choice. However, EFT did not affect delay discounting or food choice. We conclude that AAT is useful for improving food choice in obesity and that smartphones are a feasible, engaging way to deliver training.

AB  - PURPOSE: This review aims to critically evaluate the efficacy of web or mobile-based (WMB) interventions impacting emotional symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. METHOD: Articles published from 1991 to 2019 were identified using PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus. Only interventions involving adults with advanced cancer using a WMB intervention to manage emotional symptoms were included. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I and ROB2 tools. Studies that reported mean symptom scores were pooled using a random-effects model, and standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-three of the 1177 screened studies met the inclusion criteria, and a total sample of 2558 patients were included. The sample was 57% female, and 33% had advanced cancer with mean age of 57.15 years. Thirteen studies evaluated anxiety, nineteen evaluated depression, and eleven evaluated distress. Intervention components included general information, tracking, communication, multimedia choice, interactive online activities, tailoring/feedback, symptom management support content, and self-monitoring. Overall pooled results showed that WMB interventions' effects on decreasing anxiety (SMD - 0.20, - 0.45 to 0.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 72%), depression (SMD - 0.10, - 0.30 to 0.11, I<sup>2</sup> = 73%), and distress (SMD - 0.20, - 0.47 to 0.06, I<sup>2</sup> = 60%) were not significant for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In contrast, WMB interventions significantly decreased symptoms of anxiety (p = .002) in a sub-group analysis of non-RCTs. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrated that WMB interventions were not efficacious in alleviating emotional symptoms in adults with advanced cancer. Considering the diversity of interventions, the efficacy of WMB interventions and its impacts on emotional symptoms should be further explored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Developing a stroke health‐education mobile app (SHEMA) and examining its effectiveness on improvement of knowledge of stroke risk factors and health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with stroke. METHODS: We recruited 76 stroke patients and randomly assigned them to either the SHEMA intervention (nâ€‰=â€‰38) or usual care where a stroke health‐education booklet was provided (nâ€‰=â€‰38). Knowledge of stroke risk factors and HRQOL were assessed using the stroke‐knowledge questionnaire and European Quality of Life‐Five Dimensions (EQ‐5D) questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty‐three patients completed a post‐test survey (the SHEMA intervention, nâ€‰=â€‰30; traditional stroke health‐education, nâ€‰=â€‰33). Our trial found that patients' mean knowledge score of stroke risk factors was improved after the SHEMA intervention (Mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰2.83; tâ€‰=â€‰3.44; pâ€‰=â€‰.002), and patients' knowledge was also improved in the after traditional stroke health‐education (Mean differenceâ€‰=â€‰2.79; tâ€‰=â€‰3.68; pâ€‰=â€‰.001). However, patients after the SHEMA intervention did not have significantly higher changes of the stroke knowledge or HRQOL than those after traditional stroke health‐education. CONCLUSIONS: Both the SHEMA intervention and traditional stroke health‐education can improve patients' knowledge of stroke risk factors, but the SHEMA was not superior to traditional stroke health‐education. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02591511 Verification Date 2015‐10‐01.

AB  - Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. This randomized controlled, single-center, open-label trial tested the impact of a mobile health (mHealth) service tool optimized for ASCVD patient care. Patients with clinical ASCVD were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided with a smartphone application named HEART4U, while a dedicated interface integrated into the electronic healthcare record system was provided to the treating physicians. A total of 666 patients with ASCVD were enrolled, with 333 patients in each group. The estimated baseline 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease was 9.5% and 10.8% in the intervention and control groups, respectively, as assessed by the pooled cohort risk equations. The primary study endpoint was the change in the estimated risk at six months. The estimated risk increased by 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively, which did not differ significantly (P = 0.821). None of the secondary study endpoints showed significant differences between the groups. A post-hoc subgroup analysis showed the benefit was greater if a participant in the intervention group accessed the application more frequently. The present study demonstrated no significant benefits associated with the use of the mHealth tool in terms of the predefined study endpoints in stable patients with ASCVD. However, it also suggested that motivating patients to use the mHealth tool more frequently may lead to greater clinical benefit. Better design with a positive user experience needs to be considered for developing future mHealth tools for ASCVD patient care.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03392259.

AB  - The use of mobile technology and mobile apps has become pervasive in our daily lives for completing a variety of daily tasks. Mobile health (mHealth) apps can provide an accessible platform for self-management among breast cancer (BC) survivors, as they recover from not just the intensive cancer treatments, but also their associated side-effects. They also offer a means to learn about survivorship topics and connect with peer survivors online, irrespective of their geographical location. This study is an attempt to assess the availability and characterize the self-management features of free mobile apps for breast cancer survivors on the Google Play (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS). Out of 249 such apps for the Android, only eight satisfied initial criteria, while only one of 174 iOS apps that met inclusion criteria was included for further analysis. A content analysis of the nine apps that met inclusion criteria was conducted to assess the inclusion of the following mHealth self-management features derived from the Chronic Care Model: symptom tracking; survivorship education; information-sharing with family and/or caregivers; scheduling follow-up visits; personal alerts and reminders; and social networking. Survivorship education was found to be the most common self-management feature among the apps reviewed, followed by social networking. The results of this study highlight the dearth of available mHealth resources for BC survivors. Future efforts in app development should involve survivors and healthcare providers to ensure comprehensive resources that address their unmet needs are made more accessible.

AB  - PURPOSE: The use of mobile health technologies in the management of oral anticancer agents (OAA) can be beneficial in terms of treatment adherence and symptom management. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of a mobile application developed for patients using OAA on treatment adherence and symptom management. METHOD: The study was conducted using a randomized controlled trial design, and it was carried out on 77 patients. Data were collected from the Oral Chemotherapy Adherence Scale (OCAS), and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Data were collected at the beginning of the research, and face‐to‐face interviews were conducted after one, three, and six months. Patients in the intervention group were followed up for six months using the mobile application. RESULTS: It was found that there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the baseline OCAS mean scores (p > 0.05), and the mean score of the intervention group increased over the first, third‐ and sixth‐month measurements (p < 0.05). It was found that there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the MSAS mean scores (p > .05), and there was a decrease in the mean MSAS score of the intervention group between the third‐ and sixth‐month follow‐up (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The present study results showed that the mobile application is effective in managing symptoms and increasing treatment adherence. A well‐designed mobile health application that increases treatment adherence, decreases symptom severity, and supports patients' self‐management could be beneficial for patients using OAA.

AB  - Objective: : Health literacy of mothers during pregnancy shows social and cognitive skills indicating the motivation and ability of mothers to receive and use useful knowledge to maintain and promote the health of themselves and their children. The present study was conducted aimed to determine the effect of mobile app-based training on health literacy among pregnant women. Study design: A random allocation clinical trial was conducted on 140 eligible mothers. All participants were randomly allocated to the experimental and control groups. Data collection tools included personal information and maternal health literacy questionnaires. The questionnaires were completed and then a mobile app-based training intervention was performed for the experimental group. The participants of the experimental group were asked to read the contents of the software once a week for 8 weeks. The questionnaires were completed again after 8 weeks of the training intervention. The data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21. Independent t-test, Mann-Whitney U, Wilcoxon, Fisher, Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and one-way analysis of variance was used for this purpose. Results: The participants showed no statistically significant difference in terms of demographic-social information (p > 0.05). The mean change in health literacy scores after the intervention was statistically significant between the experimental and control groups (p < 0.001). Also, the mean change in health literacy scores before and after the intervention in the experimental group was statistically significant (p < 0.001). But this change in the control group was not statistically significant (p = 0.609). Conclusions: For the first time we used mobile app-based training and results showed that it is effective in the health literacy of pregnant women especially in situations like the Corona Virus pandemic. Therefore, it is suggested that health care providers, especially midwives, use this training method to promote the health literacy of pregnant women.

AB  - Objectives: Hand burns are among the most destructive types of burns, imposing significant limitations on the performance and occupation of individuals. Accordingly, this injury induces many negative effects on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to assess the effect of a self‐care educational mobile application on the QOL of victim patients with hand burns. Materials and Methods: The present randomized controlled trial included 60 burn victims admitted to the Burn Center of Imam Reza hospital, Mashhad, Iran. The intervention group used the hand burn self‐care application upon their admission up to 2 months after their hospital discharge while the controls only received the ordinary training presented in the burn center. All patients completed the Burn‐Specific Health Scale‐Brief (BSHS‐B) questionnaire before and 2 months after the intervention. Finally, data were analyzed using an independent t test, along with chi‐square and Mann‐Whitney U tests in SPSS 21. Results: Two months after using the hand burn self‐care application, the total mean score for the QOL of burn victims increased from 80.4 ± 17.9 to 182.5 ± 15.6 and 74.8 ± 15.3 to 122.4 ± 19.7 in the intervention and control groups, respectively (P< 0.001). Conclusions: According to our results, using the self‐care burn mobile application can improve the QOL of burn victims. Consequently, the use of this tool can be proposed as part of the treatment and rehabilitation procedures for these patients.

AB  - Aim The study aimed to test the effectiveness and acceptability of a smartphone application used in conjunction with a movement sensor toothbrushing attachment for promoting plaque control. Method One hundred and eight dental practice patients were recruited to the study from two general dental practices. Participants were randomised to test and control groups, and both groups offered oral hygiene instruction according to a single protocol. Test participants were given the smartphone device and toothbrush attachment. Control patients were not. After two and four weeks, full mouth plaque scores of the mouths of both test and control participants were measured. A comprehensive questionnaire administered to the test group assessed participants' views about the acceptability of the smartphone device and application. Results Full mouth plaque scores declined from 40.1 to 11.7, a reduction of 70% in the test group compared to a reduction from 29.1 to 20.5 (30%) in the control group. The device was found to be very well accepted. Participants were conscious of improving their brushing and improving their knowledge of how to brush well. They also reported enjoyment and fun being derived from use of the device and found it simple to use. Conclusion Providing immediate day‐to‐day feedback to dental patients about their brushing results in dramatic improvements in oral hygiene and highly significant reductions in plaque levels, in at least the short‐term; beyond that seen in previous toothbrushing interventions with adult patients.

AB  - Background: College students are among the most vulnerable groups to problems associated with high‐risk drinking consequences such as illness, injury, sexual abuse, and death. Promising mobile health (mHealth) approaches, such as smartphone (SP) apps, can be used in interventions to address or prevent excessive drinking. Method: The aim of the investigation was to examine the efficacy of a theoretically based mHealth SP app for alcohol intervention in two independent samples (Nâ€‰=â€‰379): Mandated participants (Study 1) and voluntary participants (Study 2). Study 1 included a controlled trial with Mandated participants randomized into either an in‐person Brief Motivational Interviewing BMI (nâ€‰=â€‰70) or BMIâ€‰+â€‰SP app intervention (nâ€‰=â€‰71). Study 2 included Voluntary participants who participated in either a Control group (nâ€‰=â€‰157) or the BMIâ€‰+â€‰SP app intervention (nâ€‰=â€‰81). Participants in both studies completed baseline and 6‐week assessments. Results: In Study 1, peak Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of participants in the in‐person BMI group had increased slightly at six weeks, while it had decreased for the app‐based BMIâ€‰+â€‰SP group. Study 2 participants using the BMIâ€‰+â€‰SP app reported significant reductions in drinking and consequences; there were no changes in the (AO) Control group. Conclusions: The BMIâ€‰+â€‰SP app was effective with both Mandated and Voluntary participants. Future testing with the BMIâ€‰+â€‰SP app is needed to assess whether reach, adoptability, portability, and sustainability are greater with the mHealth smartphone app for alcohol intervention than in‐person approaches.

AB  - Current treatments for binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa (BN) only show moderate efficacy, warranting the need for novel interventions. Impairments in food-related inhibitory control contribute to BED/BN and could be targeted by food-specific inhibitory control training (ICT). The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of augmenting treatment for individuals with BN/BED with an ICT app (FoodT), which targets motor inhibition to food stimuli using a go/no-go paradigm. Eighty patients with BED/BN receiving psychological and/or pharmacological treatment were randomly allocated to a treatment-as-usual group (TAU; n = 40) or TAU augmented with the 5-min FoodT app daily (n = 40) for 4 weeks. This mixed-methods study assessed feasibility outcomes, effect sizes of clinical change, and acceptability using self-report measures. Pre-registered cut-offs for recruitment, retention, and adherence were met, with 100% of the targeted sample size (n = 80) recruited within 12 months, 85% of participants retained at 4 weeks, and 80% of the FoodT + TAU group completing <=8 sessions. The reduction in binge eating did not differ between groups. However, moderate reductions in secondary outcomes (eating disorder psychopathology: SES = -0.57, 95% CI [-1.12, -0.03]; valuation of high energy-dense foods: SES = -0.61, 95% CI [-0.87, -0.05]) were found in the FoodT group compared to TAU. Furthermore, small greater reductions in food addiction (SES = -0.46, 95% CI [-1.14, 0.22]) and lack of premeditation (SES = -0.42, 95% CI [-0.77, -0.07]) were found in the FoodT group when compared to TAU. The focus groups revealed acceptability of FoodT. Participants discussed personal barriers (e.g. distractions) and suggested changes to the app (e.g. adding a meditation exercise). Augmenting treatment for BED/BN with a food-specific ICT app is feasible, acceptable, and may reduce clinical symptomatology with high reach and wide dissemination.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of an mHealth application (app), self‐management physical activity intervention FOOTFIT with an added patient‐provider connectivity feature (FOOTFIT+), that was designed to strengthen the lower extremities of minimally ambulatory individuals with venous leg ulcers (VLUs). DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Twenty‐four adults 18 years and older with VLUs being treated in 2 wound clinics in the Southeastern United States participated in this study. METHODS: Preliminary estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the medians of short‐term functional impacts on foot function, strength, ankle range of motion, walking capacity, depression, and physical functioning were obtained pre‐ and postassessment after the 6‐week intervention trial. RESULTS: There were negligible changes in either group for foot function. It is noted that both groups experienced substantial foot and ankle impairment at baseline. The greatest improvement in range of motion was noted in the FOOTFIT group for dorsiflexion of the right ankle (4.6 Â± 5.22 lb/in over baseline) whereas strength decreased in both ankles for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion in the FOOTFIT+ group. No improvements were noted in walking distance or physical health for FOOTFIT (slight decrease ‐2.9 Â± 5.6) and FOOTFIT+ (slight increase 3.0 Â± 6.6) during the 6‐week study period. CONCLUSIONS: In a minimally ambulatory population with VLUs, our mHealth FOOTFIT intervention composed of progressive exercise "boosts" demonstrated minimal short‐term effects. We recommend engagement with the app for a longer period to determine longer‐term outcomes of lower extremity function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with venous leg ulcers (VLUs) suffer disproportionately with multiple chronic conditions, are often physically deconditioned, and demonstrate high levels of physical inactivity. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this randomized controlled trial was to establish the feasibility of a mobile health (mHealth) physical activity exercise app for individuals with VLUs to improve lower leg function. METHODS: In a 6‐week study, adults with VLUs were recruited from 2 wound centers in South Carolina, United States, and enrolled if they were aged 18 years or older with impaired functional mobility and an ankle‐brachial index between 0.8 and 1.3. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive evidence‐based, phased, nonexertive physical conditioning activities for lower leg function (FOOTFIT) or FOOTFIT+ with an added patient‐provider communication feature. The mHealth Conditioning Activities for Lower Leg Function app also provided automated educational and motivational messages and user reports. Foot movement on the VLU‐affected leg was tracked by a Bluetooth‐enabled triaxial accelerometer. The study was guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework to assess the feasibility of reach, adherence, acceptability, implementation, and maintenance. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were recruited, enrolled, and randomized in the study. Most patients reported difficulty following the protocol for exercising and using the accelerometer and mobile phone and did not use the provider contact feature. However, all patients were adherent to the 6‐week exercise program more than 85% of the time for duration, whereas 33% (8/24) of patients adhered more than 85% for the frequency of performing the exercises. Across the three exercise levels, adherence did not differ between the two groups. Confidence limits around the difference in proportions ranged from ‐0.4 to 0.7. Providers in FOOTFIT+ were inconsistent in checking participant progress reports because of lack of time from competing work commitments. The technology became outdated quickly, making maintenance problematic. Participants said they would continue to exercise their foot and legs and liked being able to follow along with the demonstrations of each level of exercise provided through the app. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that despite initial interest in using the app, several components of the program as originally designed had limited acceptability and feasibility. Future refinements should include the use of more modern technology including smaller wearable accelerometers, mobile phones or tablets with larger screens, an app designed with larger graphics, automated reporting for providers, and more engaging user features.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a healthy lifestyle package (an antenatal behavior change intervention supported by smartphone application technology) on the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in overweight and obese women. METHODS: Women with body mass indexes (BMIs) 25‐39.9 were enrolled into this randomized controlled trial. The intervention consisted of specific dietary and exercise advice that addressed behavior change supported by a tailor‐designed smartphone application. Women in the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the incidence of GDM at 28‐30 weeks of gestation. To reduce GDM from 15% to 7.2%, we estimated that 506 women would be required to have 80% power to detect this effect size at a significance of .05, that is, 253 in each group. RESULTS: Between March 2013 and February 2016, 565 women were recruited with a mean BMI of 29.3 and mean gestational age of 15.5 weeks. The incidence of GDM did not differ between the two groups, 37 of 241 (15.4%) in the intervention group compared with 36 of 257 (14.1%) in the control group (relative risk 1.1, 95% CI 0.71‐1.66, P=.71). CONCLUSIONS: A mobile health‐supported behavioral intervention did not decrease the incidence of GDM. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry, https://www.isrctn.com/, ISRCTN29316280.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rigorous evidence is lacking whether online games can improve patients' longer‐term health outcomes. We investigated whether an online team‐based game delivering diabetes self‐management education (DSME) to patients via e‐mail or mobile application (app) can generate longer‐term improvements in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 456) on oral diabetes medications with HbA1c ≥58 mmol/mol were randomly assigned between a DSME game (with a civics booklet) and a civics game (with a DSME booklet). The 6‐month games sent two questions twice weekly via e‐mail or mobile app. Participants accrued points based on performance, with scores posted on leaderboards. Winning teams and individuals received modest financial rewards. Our primary outcome measure was HbA1c change over 12 months. RESULTS: DSME game patients had significantly greater HbA1c reductions over 12 months than civics game patients (‐8 mmol/mol [95% CI ‐10 to ‐7] and ‐5 mmol/mol [95% CI ‐7 to ‐3], respectively; P = 0.048). HbA1c reductions were greater among patients with baseline HbA1c >75 mmol/mol: ‐16 mmol/mol [95% CI ‐21 to ‐12] and ‐9 mmol/mol [95% CI ‐14 to ‐5] for DSME and civics game patients, respectively; P = 0.031. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes who were randomized to an online game delivering DSME demonstrated sustained and meaningful HbA1c improvements. Among patients with poorly controlled diabetes, the DSME game reduced HbA1c by a magnitude comparable to starting a new diabetes medication. Online games may be a scalable approach to improve outcomes among geographically dispersed patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a systemic autoimmune disease with no known cure, remains poorly understood and patients suffer from many gaps in care. Recent work has suggested that dietary and other lifestyle factors play an important role in triggering and propagating SLE in some susceptible individuals. However, the magnitude of influence of these triggers, how to identify pertinent triggers in individual patients, and whether removing these triggers confers clinical benefit is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that a digital therapeutic intervention, utilizing a mobile app that allows self‐tracking of dietary, environmental, and lifestyle triggers, paired with telehealth coaching, added to usual care, improves quality of life in patients with SLE compared with usual care alone. METHODS: In this randomized controlled pilot study, adults with SLE were assigned to a 16‐week digital therapeutic intervention plus usual care or usual care alone. Primary outcome measures were changes from baseline to 16 weeks on 3 validated health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) tools: Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy‐Fatigue (FACIT‐F), Brief Pain Inventory‐Short Form (BPI‐SF), and Lupus Quality of Life (LupusQoL). RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were randomized (23 control, 27 intervention). In per‐protocol analysis, the intervention group achieved significantly greater improvement than the control group in 9 of 11 domains: FACIT‐F (34% absolute improvement for the intervention group vs ‐1% for the control group, P<.001), BPI‐SF‐Pain Interference (25% vs 0%, P=.02), LupusQoL‐Planning (17% vs 0%, P=.004), LupusQoL‐Pain (13% vs 0%, P=.004), LupusQoL‐Emotional Health (21% vs 4%, P=.02), and LupusQoL‐Fatigue (38% vs 13%, P<.001) were significant when controlling for multiple comparisons; BPI‐SF‐Pain Severity (13% vs ‐6%, P=.049), LupusQoL‐Physical Health (17% vs 3%, P=.049), and LupusQoL‐Burden to Others (33% vs 4%, P=.04) were significant at an unadjusted 5% significance level. CONCLUSIONS: A digital therapeutic intervention that pairs self‐tracking with telehealth coaching to identify and remove dietary, environmental, and lifestyle symptom triggers resulted in statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL when added to usual care in patients with SLE.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) technologies improve hypertension outcomes, but it is unknown if this benefit applies to all populations. This review aimed to describe the impact of mHealth interventions on blood pressure outcomes in populations with disparities in digital health use. We conducted a systematic search to identify studies with systolic blood pressure (SBP) outcomes located in urban settings in high-income countries that included a digital health disparity population, defined as mean age ≥65 years; lower educational attainment (≥60% ≤high school education); and/or racial/ethnic minority (<50% non-Hispanic White for US studies). Interventions were categorized using an established self-management taxonomy. We conducted a narrative synthesis; among randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with a six-month SBP outcome, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses. Twenty-nine articles (representing 25 studies) were included, of which 15 were RCTs. Fifteen studies used text messaging; twelve used mobile applications. Studies were included based on race/ethnicity (14), education (10), and/or age (6). Common intervention components were: lifestyle advice (20); provision of self-monitoring equipment (17); and training on digital device use (15). In the meta-analyses of seven RCTs, SBP reduction at 6-months in the intervention group (mean SBP difference = -4.10, 95% CI: [-6.38, -1.83]) was significant, but there was no significant difference in SBP change between the intervention and control groups (p = 0.48). The use of mHealth tools has shown promise for chronic disease management but few studies have included older, limited educational attainment, or minority populations. Additional robust studies with these populations are needed to determine what interventions work best for diverse hypertensive patients.

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) could play an important role in assisting patients self-managing their asthma. Therefore we developed the myAirCoach mHealth system to aid self-management. We aimed to assess the effect of the myAirCoach system in addition to usual care on asthma control.  Methods: In a randomized controlled trial in the Netherlands we included 30 patients with uncontrolled asthma using a staggered enrolment with 3-7 months follow-up. Patients received either ‘usual care’ or ‘usual care + self-management support via ‘myAirCoach’’. In addition, we performed a 3-month before-after study in 12 patients in the UK. Asthma control was measured with the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), with a minimal important difference (MID) of 0.5. Secondary outcomes were exacerbation rate and quality of life, measured by the mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (mAQLQ) with a MID of 0.5. The myAirCoach system consisted of an app, myAirCoach inhaler add-on, indoor air-quality monitor, physical activity tracker, home spirometer and FeNO device.  Results: Asthma control improved in the Dutch intervention group compared to controls (ACQ-difference 0.70, p=0.006). A total of 4 severe exacerbations occurred in the intervention group compared to 12 in the control group (hazard ratio 0.22, 95%CI 0.07-0.71, p=0.011). Also quality of life improved significantly (mAQLQ difference 0.53, p= 0.04). In the UK patients, asthma control improved by 0.86 compared to baseline (p=0.007) and quality of life was 0.16 higher (p=0.64).  Conclusion: The myAirCoach mHealth self-management system provides an improvement in asthma control and quality of life and a reduction in asthma exacerbation.

AB  - Background: Self‐management programs have beneficial effects on asthma control, but their implementation in clinical practice is poor. Mobile health (mHealth) could play an important role in enhancing self‐management. Objective: To assess the clinical effectiveness and technology acceptance of myAirCoach‐supported self‐management on top of usual care in patients with asthma using inhalation medication. Methods: Patients were recruited in 2 separate studies. The myAirCoach system consisted of an inhaler adapter, an indoor air‐quality monitor, a physical activity tracker, a portable spirometer, a fraction exhaled nitric oxide device, and an app. The primary outcome was asthma control; secondary outcomes were exacerbations, quality of life, and technology acceptance. In study 1, 30 participants were randomized to either usual care or myAirCoach support for 3 to 6 months; in study 2, 12 participants were provided with the myAirCoach system in a 3‐month before‐after study. Results: In study 1, asthma control improved in the intervention group compared with controls (Asthma Control Questionnaire difference, 0.70; P =.006). A total of 6 exacerbations occurred in the intervention group compared with 12 in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.31; P =.06). Asthma‐related quality of life improved (mini Asthma‐related Quality of Life Questionnaire difference, 0.53; P =.04), but forced expiratory volume in 1 second was unchanged. In study 2, asthma control improved by 0.86 compared with baseline (P =.007) and quality of life by 0.16 (P =.64). Participants reported positive attitudes toward the system. Discussion: Using the myAirCoach support system improves asthma control and quality of life, with a reduction in severe asthma exacerbations. Well‐validated mHealth technologies should therefore be further studied.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effects of a smartphone application‐based exercise program on self‐efficacy expectations (SEE) and outcome expectations regarding exercise (OEE), physical fitness, activity level, physiological indices, and health‐related quality of life in a sample of hemodialysis patients. METHODS: A quasi‐experimental control group pre‐test post‐test design was used. Subjects were recruited from two university hospitals in G city. The subjects were assigned randomly by coin toss: 33 participants to the experimental group and 30 to the control group. A literature review and the self‐efficacy theory were used to develop the smartphone program. Experts designed and verified the program to be userfriendly and in consideration of user interaction. Data were collected through a self‐report pre‐test post‐test questionnaire and online medical records. RESULTS: In the experimental group, the levels of physical fitness and physical activity were significantly improved post‐test, but the scores on health‐related quality of life and the physical indices did not improve. In the experimental group, the SEE and OEE post‐test scores were also significantly higher than the pre‐test scores, but the control group's scores did not change. CONCLUSION: The smartphone application‐based exercise program based on self‐efficacy theory significantly improved the level of physical fitness and activity, SEE, and OEE for hemodialysis patients. The use of this application‐based exercise program for hemodialysis patients might be an effective nursing intervention tool for improving SEE, OEE, level of physical fitness, and physical activity.

AB  - Ulceration of the foot is a major complication of diabetes mellitus, and optimal self‐care may help prevent its development. Research suggests that mobile applications (apps) may affect behavioral change. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop the Mobile Diabetic Foot Personal Care System (m‐DAKBAS) and evaluate its effectiveness for patients with diabetes. METHOD: During Phase 1, a mobile app that included communication features, remote patient monitoring, and information was developed and pilot‐tested among 10 patients. The Phase 2 study, conducted from June 2017 to April 2018, used a 2‐group, pre‐test/post‐test design to evaluate the effect of the app on patients' knowledge, behavior, and self‐efficacy scores when used for 6 months. Both the experimental (app) and control groups participated in 1 education session at the start of the study. RESULTS: Of 106 patients who enrolled, 88 completed the study (44 in the experimental group and 44 in the control group). Only 6 patients had received education about foot care previously. The average age of all participants was 51.63 years (SD = 8.08). There were significantly more women in the experimental group than in the control group (65% vs. 45.5%; P = 0.5). Each participant used the app for 24 weeks, and the data entry rate was 72.9%. Throughout the study, participants had 1977 data entries (blood glucose and foot observation) in total. Differences between pre‐ and post‐intervention test scores were significantly higher for knowledge, behavior, and self‐efficacy in both groups, but the difference was greater in the experimental group (P < .05). Only post‐test knowledge scores were significantly higher in the experimental compared with the control group (P < .05). Compared to the start of the study, the proportion of participants with cracked/dry skin and inappropriate footwear was significantly lower in the experimental group but not in the control group. CONCLUSION: In this study, education and follow‐up via the mobile app and verbal‐only instruction increased the knowledge, behavior, and self‐efficacy scores of patients in both groups. Post‐study knowledge scores were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. Patient education remains a crucial component of optimal care, and further development, refinement, and testing of mobile applications to improve self‐efficacy and reduce the risk of diabetic foot are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of game‐based learning in clinical practice has shown potential advantages in previous studies. However, there have been little efforts to use smartphone‐based mobile games in the management of adult patients with cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate if patient education using a mobile game may increase drug compliance, decrease physical side effects of chemotherapy, and improve psychological status in breast cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 76 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were planned to receive cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled in this trial. Study participants were randomly assigned to a mobile game play group (game group, n=36) or a conventional education group (control group, n=40) in a ratio of 1:1. The patients were unblinded and followed prospectively for 3 weeks. Outcome measures included time spent for education, compliance to medication, physical side effects, and psychological side effects including quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: Overall, 72 out of 76 patients completed the study after 3 weeks (95%). The subjects in the game group showed high levels of satisfaction with the app. The time spent playing the mobile game in the game group was longer than that spent for self‐education in the control group (mean 22.2, SD 6.1 vs mean 5.5, SD 4.0 minutes a day; P<.001). The mobile game group showed better drug adherence (Korean version of the Medication Adherence Rating Scale; mean 7.6, SD 0.7 vs mean 6.5, SD 0.5; P<.001). The use of the mobile game was associated with lower rates of chemotherapy‐related side effects, such as nausea, fatigue, numbness of hand or foot, and hair loss, than the control group. The game group exhibited better QoL during chemotherapy (mean 74.9, SD 3.5 vs mean 72.2, SD 5.3; P=.01). However, there were no significant differences in terms of depression and anxiety scales. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests the feasibility and potentiality of the use of smartphone mobile games for patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Education using a mobile game led to better patient education, improved drug compliance, decreased side effects, and better QoL compared with conventional education. Mobile games can be used as easy, fun, and effective measures for patient education and have the potential to improve treatment outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy of a smartphone‐based, patient‐centered diabetes care system (mDiabetes) for type 2 diabetes that contains comprehensive modules for glucose monitoring, diet, physical activity, and a clinical decision support system. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 24‐week, multicenter, randomized controlled trial with adult patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. The patients were randomly assigned to the mDiabetes group or the paper logbook (pLogbook) group. The primary end point was the difference of the change in HbA1c from baseline between the two groups. RESULTS: HbA1c reduction from baseline was greater in the mDiabetes group (‐0.40 ± 0.09%, n = 90) than in the pLogbook group (‐0.06 ± 0.10%, n = 82). The difference of adjusted mean changes was 0.35% (95% CI 0.14‐0.55, P = 0.001). The proportion of patients whose HbA1c fell below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) was 41.1% for the mDiabetes group and 20.7% for the pLogbook group (odds ratio [OR] 2.01, 95% CI 1.24‐3.25, P = 0.003). The percentage of patients who attained HbA1c levels below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) without hypoglycemia was 31.1% in the mDiabetes group and 17.1% in the pLogbook group (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.03‐3.21, P = 0.024). There was no difference in the event numbers of severe hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the mDiabetes for patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes resulted in a significant reduction in HbA1c levels, with tolerable safety profiles.

AB  - The need for physical activity for health promotion is recognized, yet young adults still perform insufficient physical activity. Smartphone health programs can be applied easily without time and space constraints, and various mobile health programs based on smartphone applications have recently been developed and applied. This study aimed to measure the effects of mobile smartphone-based health programs on physical activity and obesity outcomes in young adults through a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched publications in English through electronic databases up to May 2019. Studies were included that provided interventions to improve physical activity using smartphone applications for young adults. After assessing study quality, data were extracted and synthesized concerning whether smartphone interventions affect health outcomes including physical activity and weight using Meta-Analysis software. Four randomized controlled studies and a quasi-experimental study were analyzed. They provided information related to health management, diet, physical activity, and personalized feedback using smartphone applications. The meta-analysis showed that smartphone-based health interventions significantly affect weight loss and increase physical activity. This study provides modest evidence for using smartphone health programs to improve young adults' physical activity, weight control, and body mass index (BMI). Future research is needed to understand long-term effects and the reliability of increasing physical activity through smartphone health programs.

AB  - This study identified the effects of an integrated diabetes self‐management program using smartphone application (app), based on the Information‐Motivation‐Behavioral skills (IMB) model. A randomized comparison, using a pre‐and post‐test design, was conducted with 32 participants in the experimental group and 36 in the control group. The integrated diabetes self‐management program consisted of face‐to‐face educational sessions, a diabetes self‐management smartphone app, and phone counseling. In the experimental group, diabetes self‐management knowledge (Z=‐2.70, p=.007), social motivation (Z=‐1.97, p=.048), and behavior (t=3.22, p=.002) improved, with their hemoglobin A1c (Z=‐4.83, p<.001) decreasing compared to the control group. At the post‐test, the experimental group's fasting blood sugar level (t=2.79, p=.009), total calorie intake (t=3.94, p=.001), carbohydrate intake (t=5.69, p<.001), and fat intake (t=2.54, p=.021) decreased compared to the pre‐test. An integrated diabetes self‐management program using smartphone app, based on the IMB model, should be utilized as a nursing intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While there has been an explosion of mobile device applications (apps) promoting healthful behaviors, including physical activity and sedentary patterns, surprisingly few have been based explicitly on strategies drawn from behavioral theory and evidence. OBJECTIVE: This study provided an initial 8‐week evaluation of three different customized physical activity‐sedentary behavior apps drawn from conceptually distinct motivational frames in comparison with a commercially available control app. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety‐five underactive adults ages 45 years and older with no prior smartphone experience were randomized to use an analytically framed app, a socially framed app, an affectively framed app, or a diet‐tracker control app. Daily physical activity and sedentary behavior were measured using the smartphone's built‐in accelerometer and daily self‐report measures. RESULTS: Mixed‐effects models indicated that, over the 8‐week period, the social app users showed significantly greater overall increases in weekly accelerometry‐derived moderate to vigorous physical activity relative to the other three arms (P values for between‐arm differences = .04‐.005; Social vs. Control app: d = 1.05, CI = 0.44,1.67; Social vs. Affect app: d = 0.89, CI = 0.27,1.51; Social vs. Analytic app: d = 0.89, CI = 0.27,1.51), while more variable responses were observed among users of the other two motivationally framed apps. Social app users also had significantly lower overall amounts of accelerometry‐derived sedentary behavior relative to the other three arms (P values for between‐arm differences = .02‐.001; Social vs. Control app: d = 1.10,CI = 0.48,1.72; Social vs. Affect app: d = 0.94, CI = 0.32,1.56; Social vs. Analytic app: d = 1.24, CI = 0.59,1.89). Additionally, Social and Affect app users reported lower overall sitting time compared to the other two arms (P values for between‐arm differences < .001; Social vs. Control app: d = 1.59,CI = 0.92, 2.25; Social vs. Analytic app: d = 1.89,CI = 1.17, 2.61; Affect vs. Control app: d = 1.19,CI = 0.56, 1.81; Affect vs. Analytic app: d = 1.41,CI = 0.74, 2.07). CONCLUSION: The results provide initial support for the use of a smartphone‐delivered social frame in the early induction of both physical activity and sedentary behavior changes. The information obtained also sets the stage for further investigation of subgroups that might particularly benefit from different motivationally framed apps in these two key health promotion areas.

AB  - Background:
Persistently poor glycemic control in adult type 1 diabetes patients is a common, complex, and serious problem initiating significant damage to the cardiovascular, renal, neural, and visual systems. Currently, there is a plethora of low-cost and free diabetes self-management smartphone applications available in online stores.

Objective:
The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a freely available smartphone application combined with text-message feedback from a certified diabetes educator to improve glycemic control and other diabetes-related outcomes in adult patients with type 1 diabetes in a two-group randomized controlled trial.

Methods:
Patients were recruited through an online type 1 diabetes support group and letters mailed to adults with type 1 diabetes throughout Australia. In a 6-month intervention, followed by a three-month follow-up, patients (n=72) were randomized to usual care (control group) or usual care and the use of a smartphone application (Glucose Buddy) with weekly text-message feedback from a Certified Diabetes Educator (intervention group). All outcome measures were collected at baseline and every three months over the study period. Patients’ glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) were measured with a blood test and diabetes-related self-efficacy, self-care activities, and quality of life were measured with online questionnaires.

Results:
The mean age of patients was 35.20 years (SD 10.43) (28 male, 44 female), 39% (28/72) were male, and patients had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a mean of 18.94 years (SD 9.66). Of the initial 72 patients, 53 completed the study (25 intervention, 28 control group). The intervention group significantly improved glycemic control (HbA1c) from baseline (mean 9.08%, SD 1.18) to 9-month follow-up (mean 7.80%, SD 0.75), compared to the control group (baseline: mean 8.47%, SD 0.86, follow-up: mean 8.58%, SD 1.16). No significant change over time was found in either group in relation to self-efficacy, self-care activities, and quality of life.

Conclusions:
In adjunct to usual care, the use of a diabetes-related smartphone application combined with weekly text-message support from a health care professional can significantly improve glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes.

AB  - Reducing sitting time, independent of physical activity, is important for health. However, few reports have been published regarding physical activity of housewives compared to that of employed women. We examined strategies to shorten housewives' sitting time using a single‐blind randomized controlled trial. Forty‐eight housewives (38.0 ± 4.5 years old) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: pamphlet, self‐feedback, and tailored feedback groups. All participants received a pamphlet describing the risks of prolonged sitting. The self‐feedback and tailored feedback groups were also given feedback on sitting time by a smartphone application. The tailored feedback group received individual suggestions regarding lifestyle to shorten sitting time. We measured physical activity using an accelerometer and health‐related quality of life using the Short‐Form 8. The longest prolonged sitting time significantly decreased over time, a significant reduction was observed after the intervention only in the tailored feedback group. Vitality, mental health, and role emotional components of health‐related quality of life showed a significant improvement with time but no significant differences were observed among the study groups. We suggested an easy approach to shortening prolonged sitting time in housewives using a pamphlet and feedback by smartphone. However, tailored consulting was necessary to yield a more effective result.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Ten Top Tips (10TT) is an intervention based on the habit formation theory that promotes a set of weight management behaviors alongside advice about repetition in a consistent context. Overall, 3 studies have demonstrated that the 10TT can support individuals to lose weight when delivered in a leaflet format. Delivery of 10TT via new technology such as a mobile app could potentially improve its effectiveness and make it more convenient, appealing, and wide reaching. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide preliminary indications of the usage, effectiveness, and acceptability of an Android app of the 10TT intervention (Top Tips only app) and a second version including self-regulatory strategies for dealing with tempting foods (Top Tips plus app). METHODS: The 3-month pilot randomized adults with overweight or obesity to (1) Top Tips only app, (2) Top Tips plus app, or (3) waiting list condition. Automated data from app users were collected. Validated questionnaires assessed self-regulatory skills, weight loss (kg), and behaviors at baseline and 3 months. Users' feedback on their experience using the app was assessed using open questions. RESULTS: A total of 81 participants took part in the pilot; 28 participants were randomized to the Top Tips only app, 27 to the Top Tips plus app, and 26 to the waiting list condition. On average, participants viewed a mean of 43.4 (SD 66.9) screens during a mean of 24.5 (SD 44.07) log-ins and used the app for 124.2 (SD 240.2) min over the 3-month period. Participants randomized to the Top Tips only app reported the greatest improvement in self-regulatory skills (mean 0.59, SD 1.0), weight loss (mean 4.5 kg, SD 5.2), and adherence to the target behaviors (mean 0.59, SD 0.49) compared with the Top Tips plus (mean<sub>self-regulation</sub> 0.15, SD 0.42; mean<sub>weight</sub> -1.9, SD 3.9; and mean<sub>behaviors</sub> 0.29, SD 0.29) and waiting list condition (mean<sub>self-regulation</sub> -0.02, SD 0.29; mean<sub>weight</sub> -0.01, SD 0.51; and mean<sub>behaviors</sub> 0.08, SD 0.38). Participants who reported the largest improvements, on average, viewed pages 2 to 3 times more, had 2 to 3 times more log-ins, logged their weight 2 to 3 times more, and achieved the tips more than those who reported smaller changes in these outcomes. According to users' feedback, engagement with the app could be increased by making the app more interactive and allowing more tailoring. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the Top Tips app could potentially be a useful intervention for promoting eating self-regulatory skills, weight loss, and weight management behaviors among adults with overweight or obesity. Future research should develop the app further based on user feedback and test it in larger sample sizes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: As a common experience in the general population, dissatisfaction with one's body is associated with a variety of psychological problems and unhealthy behaviors, including the development of eating disorders. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to develop and evaluate an app‐based intervention to reduce body dissatisfaction. METHOD: Participants reporting elevated levels of body dissatisfaction were randomly allocated to an app‐based intervention (n = 26) or to a wait list group (n = 27). The app‐based intervention included a brief counseling session and 14 days of training with the Mindtastic Body Dissatisfaction app (MT‐BD). The MT‐BD app uses gamification strategies to systematically foster approach of functional and avoidance of dysfunctional stimuli. The primary outcome was body dissatisfaction as assessed with the Body Dissatisfaction scale of the Eating Disorder Inventory‐2 (Garner, 1991). Secondary outcome measures included severity of eating disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater reductions in body dissatisfaction compared to the wait list group (d = ‐0.62). The intervention group also showed greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms compared to the wait list group (d = ‐0.46). Reductions in body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were sustained at a 1‐month follow‐up. CONCLUSION: We found preliminary evidence that an app‐based intervention may significantly reduce body dissatisfaction. Further research using larger samples and targeting clinical populations is necessary to evaluate the potential of interventions such as MT‐BD. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - Objective: Body dissatisfaction is a major risk factor underlying vulnerability to eating disorders. Experimental studies conducted in controlled environments suggest that body dissatisfaction could be improved by using evaluative conditioning (EC). The present study evaluates the feasibility of using an EC app in everyday life and the effects of its use on body dissatisfaction. Method: We designed a game-like app inspired by the Therapeutic EC app. 60 participants were randomly assigned to two conditions. Participants in the EC condition had to pair photographs of their own body with positive photographs, while participants in the neutral condition had to pair photographs of their own body with neutral photographs. We tested the effect of use of the app on body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, self-esteem, depressive symptoms and eating behaviors. Results: Analysis revealed that participants in all conditions presented a significant decrease in body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and an increase in self-esteem. However, contrary to our hypothesis, these effects were no greater in the EC condition than in the neutral condition. Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate the effects of an app-based EC intervention targeting body image. Results appear to be promising and the app could easily be implemented in an ecological setting as it is a low effort, attractive and accessible intervention. However, the findings question the idea that EC was responsible for the observed effects which could be explained by the exposure effect. Results are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Online communities hold great potential as interventions for health, particularly for the management of chronic illness. The social support that online communities can provide has been associated with positive treatment outcomes, including medication adherence. There are few studies that have attempted to assess whether membership of an online community improves health outcomes using rigorous designs. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a rigorous proof‐of‐concept randomized controlled trial of an online community intervention for improving adherence to asthma medicine. METHODS: This 9‐week intervention included a sample of asthmatic adults from the United Kingdom who were prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid preventer. Participants were recruited via email and randomized to either an "online community" or "no online community" (diary) condition. After each instance of preventer use, participants (N=216) were required to report the number of doses of medication taken in a short post. Those randomized to the online community condition (n=99) could read the posts of other community members, reply, and create their own posts. Participants randomized to the no online community condition (n=117) also posted their medication use, but could not read others' posts. The main outcome measures were self‐reported medication adherence at baseline and follow‐up (9 weeks postbaseline) and an objective measure of adherence to the intervention (visits to site). RESULTS: In all, 103 participants completed the study (intervention: 37.8%, 39/99; control: 62.2%, 64/117). MANCOVA of self‐reported adherence to asthma preventer medicine at follow‐up was not significantly different between conditions in either intention‐to‐treat (P=.92) or per‐protocol (P=.68) analysis. Site use was generally higher in the control compared to intervention conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Joining an online community did not improve adherence to preventer medication for asthma patients. Without the encouragement of greater community support or more components to sustain engagement over time, the current findings do not support the use of an online community to improve adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Assistant to Lift your Level of activitY (Ally) app is a smartphone application that combines financial incentives with chatbot‐guided interventions to encourage users to reach personalized daily step goals. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of incentives, weekly planning, and daily self‐monitoring prompts that were used as intervention components as part of the Ally app. METHODS: We conducted an 8 week optimization trial with n = 274 insurees of a health insurance company in Switzerland. At baseline, participants were randomized to different incentive conditions (cash incentives vs. charity incentives vs. no incentives). Over the course of the study, participants were randomized weekly to different planning conditions (action planning vs. coping planning vs. no planning) and daily to receiving or not receiving a self‐monitoring prompt. Primary outcome was the achievement of personalized daily step goals. RESULTS: Study participants were more active and healthier than the general Swiss population. Daily cash incentives increased step‐goal achievement by 8.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.1, 14.1] and, only in the no‐incentive control group, action planning increased step‐goal achievement by 5.8%, 95% CI: [1.2, 10.4]. Charity incentives, self‐monitoring prompts, and coping planning did not affect physical activity. Engagement with planning interventions and self‐monitoring prompts was low and 30% of participants stopped using the app over the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Daily cash incentives increased physical activity in the short term. Planning interventions and self‐monitoring prompts require revision before they can be included in future versions of the app. Selection effects and engagement can be important challenges for physical‐activity apps. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03384550.

AB  - Importance: Individually designed single‐patient multi‐crossover (n‐of‐1) trials can facilitate tailoring of treatments directed at various conditions, including chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) but are potentially burdensome, which may limit uptake in research and practice. Objectives: To determine whether patients randomized to participate in an n‐of‐1 trial supported by a mobile health (mHealth) app would experience less pain and improved global health, adherence, satisfaction, and shared decision making compared with patients assigned to usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial compared participation in an individualized, mHealth‐supported n‐of‐1 trial vs usual care. The participating 215 patients had CMSP for at least 6 weeks, had a smartphone or tablet with a data plan, were enrolled in northern California from July 2014 through July 2016, and were followed for up to 1 year by 48 clinicians in academic, community, Veterans Affairs, and military settings. Interventions: Intervention patients met with their clinicians and used a desktop interface to select treatments and trial parameters for an n‐of‐1 trial comparing 2 pain‐management regimens. The mHealth app provided reminders to take designated treatments on assigned days and to upload responses to daily questions on pain and treatment‐associated adverse effects. Control patients received care as usual. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in the PROMIS (Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) pain‐related interference 8‐item short‐form scale (full scale range, 41‐78) from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included patient‐reported pain intensity, overall health, analgesic adherence, trust in clinician, satisfaction with care, medication‐related shared decision making, and, for the n‐of‐1 group only, participant engagement and experience. Results: Among 215 patients (108 randomized to the n‐of‐1 intervention and 107 to control), 102 (47%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 55.5 (11.1) years. At the 6‐month follow‐up, pain interference was reduced in both groups, though there was no difference between the intervention and control groups (‐1.36 points; 95% CI, ‐2.91 to 0.19 points; P=.09). There were no advantages in secondary outcomes for intervention patients vs control patients except for higher medication‐related shared decision making at 6 months (between‐group difference, 11.9 points; 95% CI, 2.6‐21.2 points; P=.01). Among patients assigned to the n‐of‐1 group, 88% (n=86) affirmed that the mHealth app could help people like them manage their pain. Conclusions and Relevance: In this population of patients with CMSP, mHealth‐supported n‐of‐1 trials were feasible and associated with a satisfactory user experience, but n‐of‐1 trial participation did not significantly improve pain interference at 6 months vs usual care. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02116621.

AB  - Background and Purpose—Feasibility of utilizing the Stroke Riskometer App (App) to improve stroke awareness and modify stroke risk behaviors was assessed to inform a full randomized controlled trial. Methods—A parallel, open‐label, 2‐arm prospective, proof‐of‐concept pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomized to usual care/control or App intervention group and assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months. The App measures stroke risk and provides information on management of risk factors. Participants were aged >19 years with at least 2 modifiable stroke risk factors identified, no prior stroke, and owned a smartphone. Results—Fifty participants (24 control, 26 App) were recruited from 148 eligible participants. Retention in the trial was 87%. Mean cardiovascular health (Life’s Simple 7) improved by 0.36 (95% CI, −2.10 to 1.38) in the App group compared with 0.01 (95% CI, −1.34 to 1.32) in controls (P=0.6733). Conclusions—These findings support a full randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the Stroke Riskometer for primary stroke prevention.

AB  - Introduction: Mobile phone‐based messaging support and biomarker feedback independently show evidence of increasing an individual's likelihood of quitting smoking. However, the combination of these two strategies to facilitate smoking cessation has not been adequately explored. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Baltimore, Maryland, to assess the efficacy of COach2Quit, a smartphone application that provides exhaled carbon monoxide readings with message support. The primary outcome was self‐reported and biochemically verified smoking cessation at 30‐day follow‐up. Secondary outcomes were reduction in smoking, motivation to quit, and engagement and satisfaction with COach2Quit. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was conducted. Results: Adult smokers were randomized 1:1 to receive brief advice and COach2Quit (intervention, n = 50) or brief advice only (control, n = 52). Thirteen participants were lost to follow‐up. At 30‐day follow‐up, one participant in each arm quit smoking. Median change in carbon monoxide levels (in parts per million (ppm)) (intervention: ‐3.0 [interquartile range (IQR) ‐12.0, 2.0]; control: ‐2.5 [IQR ‐9.0, 2.0]) and median change in number of cigarettes smoked per day (intervention: ‐5.5 [IQR ‐14.0, ‐1.0]; control: ‐6.0 [IQR ‐10.0, ‐2.0]) was similar between study arms. There was no significant difference in mean percent change in the Reasons for Quitting scale score (intervention: 6.3 [95% confidence interval = ‐2.2% to 14.8%]; control: ‐3.6 [95% confidence interval = ‐9.2% to 2.1%]). A majority (n = 32, 91%) of participants liked having COach2Quit to help them quit smoking. Conclusions: There were no significant differences in smoking cessation, smoking reduction, and motivation to quit between study arms. However, high satisfaction with the COach2Quit application indicates its feasibility and acceptability as a smoking cessation tool. Implications: Smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Although counseling and pharmacotherapy are efficacious for smoking cessation, they are not easily accessible or desirable to all smokers, highlighting the need for identifying other interventions. There is evidence for the efficacy of mobile phone‐based messaging support for smoking cessation. However, there is limited research on the efficacy of biomarker feedback, much less interventions that combine these two approaches. This research contributes to filling this gap and identifying novel interventions to facilitate smoking cessation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at risk for secondary medical complications, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pressure injuries, that could potentially be mitigated through improved self‐management techniques. The Interactive Mobile Health and Rehabilitation (iMHere) mobile health (mHealth) system was developed to support self‐management for individuals with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to determine if the use of iMHere would be associated with improved health outcomes over a 9‐month period. A secondary objective was to determine if the use of iMHere would be associated with improved psychosocial outcomes. Phone usage, app usage, and training time data were also collected to analyze trends in iMHere use. METHODS: Overall, 38 participants with SCI were randomized into either the intervention group who used the iMHere system and received standard care or the control group who received standard care without any technology intervention. Health outcomes were recorded for the year before entry into the study and during the 9 months of the study. Participants completed surveys at baseline and every 3 months to measure psychosocial outcomes. RESULTS: The intervention group had a statistically significant reduction in UTIs (0.47 events per person; P=.03; number needed to treat=2.11). Although no psychosocial outcomes changed significantly, there was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in mood symptoms in the intervention group compared with the control group meeting the threshold for clinical significance. Approximately 34 min per participant per month were needed on average to manage the system and provide technical support through this mHealth system. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the iMHere mHealth system may be a valuable tool in the prevention of UTIs or reductions in depressive symptoms. Given these findings, iMHere has potential scalability for larger populations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02592291; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02592291.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment is associated with long‐term disability that results in the deterioration of both the social and professional status of individuals with schizophrenia. The impact of antipsychotic therapy on cognitive function is insufficient. Cognitive training is therefore proposed as a tool for cognitive rehabilitation in schizophrenia. In this study we investigated the effect of self‐administered cognitive training using a smartphone‐based application on the cognitive function of paranoid schizophrenia patients focusing on response time, correct answer rate, incorrect answer rate, and fatigability to check, if these functions can be functional markers of successful cognitive‐smartphone rehabilitation. Methods: 1‐year multicenter, open‐label randomized study was conducted on 290 patients in a state of symptomatic remission. 191 patients were equipped with the full version of the application and conducted cognitive training twice a week. Reference group (n = 99) was provided with a version of the application having only limited functionality, testing the cognitive performance of patients every 6 months. Results: Statistically significant improvement was observed in both the rate of correct answers (by 4.8%, p = 0.0001), and cognitive fatigability (by 2.9%, p = 0.0001) in the study group, along with a slight improvement in the rate of incorrect answers (by 0.9%, p = 0.15). In contrast, the reference group, who performed cognitive training every 6 months, demonstrated no significant changes in any cognitive activities. Conclusions: Cognitive trainings facilitated by a smartphone‐based application, performed regularly for a longer period of time are feasible and may have the potential to improve the cognitive functioning of individuals with schizophrenia. Correct answers and cognitive fatigability have potential to be functional markers of successful smartphone‐based psychiatric rehabilitations in schizophrenia patients.

AB  - Objective: Assess the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing technology‐delivered mindfulness‐based intervention (MBI) programs against a waitlist control arm targeting advanced cancer patients and their informal caregivers. Methods: Two‐arm cluster RCT within Kaiser Permanente Northern California. We recruited patients with metastatic solid malignancies or hematological cancers and their informal caregivers. Intervention‐group participants chose to use either a commercially available mindfulness app (10–20 min/day) or a webinar‐based mindfulness course for 6 weeks. The waitlist control group received usual care. We assessed feasibility measures and obtained participant‐reported data on quality of life (QoL; primary outcome) and distress outcomes (secondary) pre‐ and postintervention. Results: A hundred and three patients (median age 67 years; 70% female; 81% White) and 39 caregivers (median age 66 years; 79% female; 69% White) were enrolled. Nearly all participants chose the mindfulness app over the webinar‐based program. Among the participants in the intervention arm who chose the mobile‐app program and completed the postintervention (6‐week) survey, 21 (68%) patients and 7 (47%) caregivers practiced mindfulness at least 50% of the days during the 6‐week study period. Seventy‐four percent of intervention participants were “very” or “extremely” satisfied with the mindfulness program. We observed improvements in anxiety, QoL, and mindfulness among patients in the intervention arm compared to those in the control group. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of conducting a cluster RCT of mHealth MBI for advanced cancer patients and their caregivers. Such remote interventions can be helpful particularly during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent in the population, but relatively few affected individuals receive treatment for it. Smartphone applications (apps) could help address this unmet need by offering sound psychoeducational information and evidence‐based cognitive behavioral coping tools. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a free, publicly available smartphone app (PTSD Coach) for self‐management of PTSD symptoms. METHOD: One hundred 20 participants who were an average of 39 years old, mostly women (69.2%) and White (66.7%), recruited primarily through online advertisements, were randomized to either a PTSD Coach (n = 62) or a waitlist condition (n = 58) for 3 months. Web‐administered self‐report measures of PTSD, PTSD symptom coping self‐efficacy, depression, and psychosocial functioning were conducted at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months following treatment. RESULTS: Following the intent‐to‐treat principle, repeated‐measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that at posttreatment, PTSD Coach participants had significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms (p = .035), depression symptoms (p = .005), and psychosocial functioning (p = .007) than did waitlist participants; however, at posttreatment, there were no significant mean differences in outcomes between conditions. A greater proportion of PTSD Coach participants achieved clinically significant PTSD symptom improvement (p = .018) than waitlist participants. CONCLUSION: PTSD Coach use resulted in significantly greater improvements in PTSD symptoms and other outcomes relative to a waitlist condition. Given the ubiquity of smartphones, PTSD Coach may provide a wide‐reaching, convenient public health intervention for individuals with PTSD symptoms who are not receiving care.

AB  - App‐controlled feedback devices can support sustainability of weight loss. Multicentre QUANT‐study shows additional weight loss and gain of QoL via multiple feedback‐devices in OPTIFAST®52‐programObjective: Are three app‐controlled feedback devices, tested against a simple pedometer in a weight reduction program, supporting sustainable therapy success and quality of life (QoL)? Methods: In this multi‐centre randomised controlled study adults with obesity (n = 89, m = 46.5 years, women n = 54), achieved high weight loss (from 42.7 kg/m² to 35.2 kg/m²) while completing the first three month of the OPTIFAST®52‐program. Thereafter the intervention group (IG) used feedback devices (BIA scale, blood pressure monitor, step counter), the control group a mechanical pedometer without app for another year. Intention‐to‐treat analysis (ITT) and As‐treated analysis (AT) were carried out. Results: Feedback devices had a positive effect on fat‐loss and secondary study objectives like QoL, leading to a better sustainability of these improvements. Participants in IG (AT for t2‐t0) had improvements for Waist‐to‐Height‐ratio (WHtR) and physically and mentally quality of life. Conclusion: The results are presumably based on an increase in self‐efficacy and the experience of control. Future studies should be preceded by a pilot study to analyse acceptance problems.

AB  - Purpose: Era Disruption 4.0 demands development in the management of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) by using application‐based intervention that can facilitate nursing intervention. The aim was to evaluate the effect of diabetes mellitus calendar app as a Diabetes Self‐Management Education (DSME) program on self‐efficacy, HbA1c levels, lipid profile, and insulin in adult type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: It was randomized experimental design â€” simple random sampling used with a total sample of 30 respondents. The instruments used diabetes management self‐efficacy scales and standard of operational procedure blood sampling. The statistical tests used were a Paired t‐test, Wilcoxon, and an Independent t‐test. Results: DSME with an Android‐based DM calendar affected self‐efficacy (p < 0.001), HbA1c levels (p = 0.005), cholesterol (p = 0.009), triglyceride (p = 0.000), HDL‐c (p = 0.048), LDL‐c (p = 0.010), and insulin (p = 0.000) compared with the control group. Education with these electronic media has increased the perception of self‐efficacy and improved the behavior of good self‐management that can be seen from changes in controlled HbA1c level, lipid profile and insulin. Conclusion: The results of this study can be used as a reference for providing educational experimental in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the major morbidities in public health, and the use of mHealth technology for rehabilitation of patients with COPD can help increase physical activity and ameliorate respiratory symptoms. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a comprehensive rehabilitation management platform to improve physical activity and quality of life in patients with COPD. METHODS: The study comprised the following 2 stages: (1) a pilot stage in which a prototype app was developed; and (2) a fully‐fledged platform development stage in which 2 apps and 1 COPD patient monitoring website were developed. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of the apps developed in the second stage of the study. In addition, two 12‐week exercise regimens (fixed and fixed‐interactive) were tested for the trial. The clinical parameters of the respiratory function and patient global assessment (PGA) of the app were obtained and analyzed. Notably, Android was the chosen operating system for apps. RESULTS: We developed 2 COPD rehabilitation apps and 1 patient monitoring website. For the clinical trial, 85 patients were randomized into the following 3 groups: 57 were allocated to the 2 intervention groups and 28 to the control group. After 6 weeks, the COPD assessment test scores were significantly reduced in the fixed group (P=.01), and signs of improvement were witnessed in the fixed‐interactive group. In addition, the PGA score was moderate or high in all aspects of the user experience of the apps in both intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: A well‐designed mobile rehabilitation app for monitoring and managing patients with COPD can supplement or replace traditional center‐based rehabilitation programs and achieve improved patient health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global pandemic that threatens the health of the population and the sustainability of publicly funded health care. This randomised controlled trial addresses the gap in the literature surrounding unconscious persuasion and its use in weight loss and weight management. The Slimpod® tool is unlike any of those currently available on the market. Using breakthrough research in 'nudge' thinking, it is designed to retrain an adult's habitual and emotional response to foodstuffs. This therapeutic model allows unconscious thought to be shaped into a manner more consistent with a healthy lifestyle. Candidates can then take control of their eating behaviours to induce a holistic state of wellbeing. AIM: To assess the effectiveness of an audio unconscious‐persuasion weight loss/weight management intervention (Slimpod®) compared with audio relaxation (control). METHOD: Eighty‐two overweight adults were randomised to intervention (n = 41) and control groups (n = 41). Weight was assessed at trial commencement, mid‐trial (12 weeks), and trial end (24 weeks). Secondary outcomes were assessed using the Eating Self‐Efficacy Scale (ESES), Exercise Confidence Scale (ECS), and Quality of Life Index Generic Version III (QLI‐G3) at the start and end of the trial. RESULTS: Reports found a statistically significant difference in mean weight loss between intervention group (1.7 kg at 12 weeks and 4.3 kg at 24 weeks) versus control (0.6 kg and 1.2 kg respectively) at P<0.001. ESES scores showed greater self‐efficacy (P = 0.008) in intervention at 24 weeks. No significant differences in ESES negative affect sub‐scale score or ECS were observed. CONCLUSION: Slimpod® was effective at reducing weight and increasing eating self‐efficacy in overweight adults.

AB  - Mental health problems like anxiety, depression, and stress have been increasing in many countries and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated their toll. Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to provide evidence-based treatments for anxiety and depression, and accumulating evidence is emerging in support of using mindfulness apps yielding small-to-moderate treatment effects. The study was a 4-week randomized controlled trial with 561 university students and staff as participants, divided into a treatment group (mindfulness app) and an active control group (psychoeducational online content). Depression, anxiety, and stress were evaluated as primary study outcomes. Saliva cortisol samples were also collected from a subgroup of the treatment arm (n = 29). Using the mindfulness app for four weeks resulted in small reductions in stress (d = .16), and depression (d = .16). Attrition was 28.0%. Subjects who practiced more did not experience additional improvement in wellbeing. Mindfulness apps offer modest but clear benefits to users in terms of improved mental health. They present a promising supplement to traditional mental health services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many smartphone applications (apps) for weight loss are available, but little is known about their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of introducing primary care patients to a free smartphone app for weight loss. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01650337). SETTING: 2 academic primary care clinics. PATIENTS: 212 primary care patients with body mass index of 25 kg/m2 or greater. INTERVENTION: 6 months of usual care without (n = 107) or with (n = 105) assistance in downloading the MyFitnessPal app (MyFitnessPal). MEASUREMENTS: Weight loss at 6 months (primary outcome) and changes in systolic blood pressure and behaviors, frequency of app use, and satisfaction (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: After 6 months, weight change was minimal, with no difference between groups (mean between‐group difference, ‐0.30 kg [95% CI, ‐1.50 to 0.95 kg]; P = 0.63). Change in systolic blood pressure also did not differ between groups (mean between‐group difference, ‐1.7 mm Hg [CI, ‐7.1 to 3.8 mm Hg]; P = 0.55). Compared with patients in the control group, those in the intervention group increased use of a personal calorie goal (mean between‐group difference, 2.0 d/wk [CI, 1.1 to 2.9 d/wk]; P < 0.001), although other self‐reported behaviors did not differ between groups. Most users reported high satisfaction with MyFitnessPal, but logins decreased sharply after the first month. LIMITATIONS: Despite being blinded to the name of the app, 14 control group participants (13%) used MyFitnessPal. In addition, 32% of intervention group participants and 19% of control group participants were lost to follow‐up at 6 months. The app was given to patients by research assistants, not by physicians. CONCLUSION: Smartphone apps for weight loss may be useful for persons who are ready to self‐monitor calories, but introducing a smartphone app is unlikely to produce substantial weight change for most patients.

AB  - The progressive nature of Parkinson's disease, its complex treatment regimens and the high rates of comorbid conditions make self‐management and treatment adherence a challenge. Clinicians have limited face‐to‐face consultation time with Parkinson's disease patients, making it difficult to comprehensively address non‐adherence. Here we share the results from a multi‐centre (seven centres) randomised controlled trial conducted in England and Scotland to assess the impact of using a smartphone‐based Parkinson's tracker app to promote patient self‐management, enhance treatment adherence and quality of clinical consultation. Eligible Parkinson's disease patients were randomised using a 1:1 ratio according to a computer‐generated random sequence, stratified by centre and using blocks of variable size, to intervention Parkinson's Tracker App or control (Treatment as Usual). Primary outcome was the self‐reported score of adherence to treatment (Morisky medication adherence scale ‐8) at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were Quality of Life (Parkinson's disease questionnaire ‐39), quality of consultation for Parkinson's disease patients (Patient‐centred questionnaire for Parkinson's disease), impact on non‐motor symptoms (Non‐motor symptoms questionnaire), depression and anxiety (Hospital anxiety and depression scale) and beliefs about medication (Beliefs about Medication Questionnaire) at 16 weeks. Primary and secondary endpoints were analysed using a generalised linear model with treatment as the fixed effect and baseline measurement as the covariate. 158 patients completed the study (Parkinson's tracker app = 68 and TAU = 90). At 16 weeks Parkinson's tracker app significantly improved adherence, compared to treatment as usual (mean difference: 0.39, 95%CI 0.04‐0.74; p = 0.0304) with no confounding effects of gender, number of comorbidities and age. Among secondary outcomes, Parkinson's tracker app significantly improved patients' perception of quality of consultation (0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.27; p = 0.0110). The change in non‐motor symptoms was ‐0.82 (95% CI ‐1.75 to 0.10; p = 0.0822). 72% of participants in the Parkinson's tracker app group continued to use and engage with the application throughout the 16‐week trial period. The Parkinson's tracker app can be an effective and novel way of enhancing self‐reported medication adherence and quality of clinical consultation by supporting self‐management in Parkinson's disease in patients owning smartphones. Further work is recommended to determine whether the benefits of the intervention are maintained beyond the 16 week study period.

AB  - QUESTION: Do people with musculoskeletal conditions better adhere to their home exercise programs when these are provided to them on an app with remote support compared to paper handouts? DESIGN: Randomised, parallel‐group trial with intention‐to‐treat analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty participants with upper or lower limb musculoskeletal conditions were recruited to the trial. Each participant was prescribed a 4‐week home exercise program by a physiotherapist at a tertiary teaching hospital in Australia. Participants were randomly assigned via a computer‐generated concealed block randomisation procedure to either intervention (n=40) or control (n=40) groups. INTERVENTION: Participants in the intervention group received their home exercise programs on an app linked to the freely available website www.physiotherapyexercises.com. They also received supplementary phone calls and motivational text messages. Participants in the control group received their home exercise programs as a paper handout. OUTCOME MEASURES: Blinded assessors collected outcome measures at baseline and 4 weeks. The primary outcome was self‐reported exercise adherence. There were five secondary outcomes, which captured functional performance, disability, patient satisfaction, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, and different aspects of adherence. RESULTS: Outcomes were available on 77 participants. The mean between‐group difference for self‐reported exercise adherence at 4 weeks was 1.3/11 points (95% CI 0.2 to 2.3), favouring the intervention group. The mean between‐group difference for function was 0.9/11 points (95% CI 0.1 to 1.7) on the Patient‐Specific Functional Scale, also favouring the intervention group. There were no significant between‐group differences for the remaining outcomes. CONCLUSION: People with musculoskeletal conditions adhere better to their home exercise programs when the programs are provided on an app with remote support compared to paper handouts; however, the clinical importance of this added adherence is unclear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young adults with mobility disability report lower health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) than their able‐bodied peers. This study aims to examine potential differences between the effects of mobile app versus supervised training and the association of cardiorespiratory fitness change with HRQoL in young adults with mobility disability. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a parallel randomized controlled trial of a mobile app (n = 55) and a supervised health program (n = 55) that was provided for 12 weeks to 110 adults (18‐45 years) with self‐perceived mobility disability. Recruitment took place at rehabilitation centers in Stockholm, Sweden. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated from the results of a submaximal cycle ergometer test and HRQoL was assessed with the SF‐36 questionnaire. Follow up was at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1‐year and all examinations were performed by blinded investigators. Between group differences of changes in HRQoL at follow up were estimated in intention‐to‐treat analysis using linear regression models. Crude and adjusted mixed‐effects models estimated the associations between cardiorespiratory fitness change and HRQoL. Stratified analysis by intervention group was also performed. RESULTS: In total, 40/55 from the mobile app group and 49/55 from the supervised training group were included in the intention to treat analysis. No significant differences were observed between the effects of the two interventions on HRQoL. In both crude and adjusted models, cardiorespiratory fitness change was associated with the general health (adjusted β = 1.30, 95% CI: 0.48, 2.13) and emotional role functioning (adjusted β = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.11, 2.25) domains of SF‐36. After stratification, the associations with general health (adjusted β = 1.88, 95% CI: 0.87, 2.90) and emotional role functioning (adjusted β = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.18, 2.57) were present only in the supervised group. CONCLUSION: This study found positive associations between cardiorespiratory fitness change and HRQoL in young adults with mobility disability who received supervised training. The effects of mobile app versus supervised training on HRQoL remain unclear.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed a smartphone-based program to promote practical and mildly demanding arm responses and personal satisfaction and increase physical exertion (heart rates) in people with advanced Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The program relied on a Samsung Galaxy A3 smartphone with Android 6.0 operating system. Two groups of 10 and 11 participants, respectively, were assigned different responses (ie, placing cards into an elevated box and moving bottles with water from a table into a container). Responses activated the smartphone, which produced brief periods of preferred stimulation. Lack of responding led the smartphone to produce a verbal prompt. RESULTS: All participants had significant increases in independent response frequencies, level of personal satisfaction, and heart rates during program sessions as opposed to baseline or control sessions. CONCLUSION: A smartphone-based program may help people with advanced Alzheimer's disease increase independent occupation with possible benefits in terms of satisfaction and physical condition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of physical activity interventions involving mobile applications (apps) or trackers with automated and continuous self-monitoring and feedback. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and seven additional databases, from 2007 to 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials in adults (18-65 years old) without chronic illness, testing a mobile app or an activity tracker, with any comparison, where the main outcome was a physical activity measure. Independent screening was conducted. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We conducted random effects meta-analysis and all effect sizes were transformed into standardised difference in means (SDM). We conducted exploratory metaregression with continuous and discrete moderators identified as statistically significant in subgroup analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical activity: daily step counts, min/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, weekly days exercised, min/week of total physical activity, metabolic equivalents. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies met inclusion criteria and 28 were included in the meta-analysis (n=7454 participants, 28% women). The meta-analysis showed a small-to-moderate positive effect on physical activity measures (SDM 0.350, 95% CI 0.236 to 0.465, I2=69%, T2=0.051) corresponding to 1850 steps per day (95% CI 1247 to 2457). Interventions including text-messaging and personalisation features were significantly more effective in subgroup analyses and metaregression. CONCLUSION: Interventions using apps or trackers seem to be effective in promoting physical activity. Longer studies are needed to assess the impact of different intervention components on long-term engagement and effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the increasing breast cancer incidence and mortality rates, Korean American immigrant women have one of the lowest rates of breast cancer screening across racial groups in the United States. Mobile health (mHealth), defined as the delivery of health care information or services through mobile communication devices, has been utilized to successfully improve a variety of health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study adapted the principles of mHealth to advance breast cancer prevention efforts among Korean American immigrant women, an underserved community. METHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial design, 120 Korean American women aged 40 to 77 years were recruited and randomly assigned to either the mMammogram intervention group (n=60) to receive culturally and personally tailored multilevel and multimedia messages through a mobile phone app along with health navigator services or the usual care control group (n=60) to receive a printed brochure. Outcome measures included knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about breast cancer screening, readiness for mammography, and mammogram receipt. The feasibility and acceptability of the mMammogram intervention was also assessed. RESULTS: The intervention group showed significantly greater change on scores of knowledge of breast cancer and screening guidelines (P=.01). The intervention group also showed significantly greater readiness for mammography use after the intervention compared with the control group. A significantly higher proportion of women who received the mMammogram intervention (75%, 45/60) completed mammograms by the 6-month follow-up compared with the control group (30%, 18/60; P<.001). In addition, the intervention group rated satisfaction with the intervention (P=.003), effectiveness of the intervention (P<.001), and increase of knowledge on breast cancer and screenings (P=.001) significantly higher than the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A mobile phone app-based intervention combined with health navigator service was a feasible, acceptable, and effective intervention mechanism to promote breast cancer screening in Korean American immigrant women. A flexible, easily tailored approach that relies on recent technological advancements can reach underserved and hard-to-recruit populations that bear disproportionate cancer burdens.

AB  - Introduction Chronic neck pain in office workers is a prevalent occupational disorder. Recently, smartphone applications (apps) have increased rapidly, and provide the benefits in terms of accessibility to health information. The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an app‐based exercise in office workers on pain intensity, functional disability, exercise adherence, muscle strength, quality of life and fear‐avoidance. Methods 20 office workers participated in the study excluding one drop‐out. The app‐based exercise group (n = 11) conducted neck exercise through the mobile app in the workplace environment for at least 10–15 min/day, 2 days/week for 8 weeks while the control group (n = 9) received a brochure showing how to correct their posture themselves during the same period. Evaluations using the following were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks: the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), for pain intensity; Neck Disability Index (NDI), for functional disability; level of exercise adherence; maximal voluntary flexion/extension strength (MVFS/MVES); 36‐Item Short‐Form Healthy Survey (SF‐36), for quality of life; and Fear‐Avoidance Belief Questionnaire (FABQ). Results Within the app‐based exercise group, the VAS (P = 0.003) and NDI (P = 0.005) improved significantly after the app‐based neck exercise. MVES (P = 0.013), physical component summary (P = 0.02) of the SF‐36, and the work‐related subscale (P = 0.011) in the FABQ improved significantly. The level of exercise adherence was high. In VAS and NDI, there were statistically significant differences in the amounts of improvement between the groups. Conclusion An app‐based neck exercise positively effects pain intensity, functional disability and partially improves muscle strength, SF‐36 score, and FABQ score.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies on physical activity were analyzed by randomizing participants into either the intervention or control group. It is necessary to classify each intervention and control groups according to physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). METHODS: This was a pilot project for SmartCare Services. The intervention group received obesity management services using a smartphone for 24 weeks, while the control group did not receive the interventions. Six anthropometric indices were analyzed: weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body fat, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Five laboratory tests, including fasting blood sugar (FBS), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TGs), were also assessed. The final 324 participants were categorized using the IPAQ questionnaire, and anthropometric indices and laboratory tests were analyzed for within‐group and between‐group changes from baseline to final visit. RESULTS: Statistically significant decreases in the intervention group compared with the control group were observed in terms of insufficient activity (IA) (‐1.6 ± 3.03 vs ‐0.1 ± 1.94 kg) and moderate activity (MA) (‐2.5 ± 3.81 vs ‐0.3 ± 2.24 kg) for weight, IA (‐0.7 ± 1.14 vs ‐0.2 ± 0.93 kg/m) and MA (‐0.9 ± 1.30 vs ‐0.2 ± 0.86 kg/m) for BMI, and health‐enhancing physical activity (HEPA) (‐1.6 ± 3.69% vs ‐0.1 ± 3.15%) for body fat. For HbA1c, HEPA in the intervention group showed significant decreases (‐0.2 ± 0.67 vs 0.0 ± 0.34 mg/dL) compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: Anthropometric indices and laboratory test results were improved in the smartphone‐based intervention group. Especially, improvement of metabolic components in the group with more active physical activity was remarkable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) has continuously been used as a method in behavioral research to improve self-management in patients with chronic diseases. However, the evidence of its effectiveness in chronic disease management in the adult population is still lacking. We conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on process measures as well as health outcomes in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve chronic disease management. METHODS: Relevant randomized controlled studies that were published between January 2005 and March 2016 were searched in six databases: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria were RCTs that conducted an intervention using mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets for adult patients with chronic diseases to examine disease management or health promotion. RESULTS: Of the 12 RCTs reviewed, 10 of the mHealth interventions demonstrated statistically significant improvement in some health outcomes. The most common features of mHealth systems used in the reviewed RCTs were real-time or regular basis symptom assessments, pre-programed reminders, or feedbacks tailored specifically to the data provided by participants via mHealth devices. Most studies developed their own mHealth systems including mobile apps. Training of mHealth systems was provided to participants in person or through paper-based instructions. None of the studies reported the relationship between health outcomes and patient engagement levels on the mHealth system. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from mHealth intervention studies for chronic disease management have shown promising aspects, particularly in improving self-management and some health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One in five Canadians experience mental health issues with those in the age range of 15 to 24 years being most at risk of a mood disorder. University students have shown significantly higher rates of mental health problems than the general public. Current university support services are limited by factors such as available staff and finances, and social stigma has frequently been identified as an additional barrier that prevents students from accessing these resources. Mobile health (mHealth) apps are one form of alternative health support that is discrete and accessible to students, and although they are recognized as a promising alternative, there is limited research demonstrating their efficacy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate a mindfulness-based app's ("DeStressify") efficacy on stress, anxiety, depressive symptomology, sleep behavior, work or class absenteeism, work or school productivity, and quality of life (QoL) among university students. METHODS: Full-time undergraduate students at a Canadian university with smartphones and Internet access were recruited through in-class announcements and on-campus posters. Participants randomized into an experimental condition were given and instructed to use the DeStressify app 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Control condition participants were wait-listed. All participants completed pre- and postintervention Web-based surveys to self-assess stress, anxiety, depressive symptomatology, sleep quality, and health-related QoL. RESULTS: A total of 206 responses were collected at baseline, with 163 participants completing the study (86 control, 77 experimental). Using DeStressify was shown to reduce trait anxiety (P=.01) and improve general health (P=.001), energy (P=.01), and emotional well-being (P=.01) in university students, and more participants in the experimental condition believed their productivity improved between baseline and postintervention measurements than the number of participants expected to believe so randomly by chance (P=.01). The app did not significantly improve stress, state anxiety, physical and social functioning, and role limitations because of physical or emotional health problems or pain (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based apps may provide an effective alternative support for university students' mental health. Universities and other institutions may benefit from promoting the use of DeStressify or other mindfulness-based mHealth apps among students who are interested in methods of anxiety management or mindfulness-based self-driven health support. Future steps include examining DeStressify and similar mHealth apps over a longer period and in university staff and faculty.

AB  - Background: Recently, the application of smartphone in medical field has received great attention.Introduction: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of smartphone‐based and conventional pedometer‐based exercise monitoring systems in promoting home exercise among prostate cancer patients.Methods: Prostate cancer patients who have undergone surgery or androgen deprivation therapy were recruited. All participants were provided with physical activity goals based on their activities and were advised to achieve these goals during their home exercise period. The intervention group was instructed to use smartphone application to record their activities; they also received weekly remote consultations based on the activity record from the application, without visiting a clinic. The control group was instructed to keep a written record of their daily activities based on pedometer readings; these records were checked by clinicians during follow‐up visits. The uptake, adherence, and completion rates of two groups were compared by intention‐to‐treat analysis. Changes in physical function during the exercise period were analyzed.Results: In total, 100 patients were recruited (smartphone: 5 and pedometer: 50). No significant differences were detected between groups in rates of uptake (80.0% vs. 88.0%, p = 0.28), adherence (92.5% vs. 79.5%, p = 0.12), or completion (76.0% vs. 86.0%, p = 0.20). Physical functions were significantly improved in both groups.Conclusions: The smartphone‐based exercise monitoring system and the pedometer yielded comparable results in promoting physical activity, as assessed by rates of uptake, adherence, and completion. Exercise monitoring was effective in improving physical functions, in both methods.

AB  - Objective: Most healthcare providers are reluctant to use health apps for healthcare because there is no rigorous way of choosing the best app for their patient or consumer. Accordingly, we developed a new method of app selection that fully considers target users' needs. This study verified whether health apps selected based on target users' needs can influence health‐related factors. Materials and Methods: We conducted a randomized control trial of women with dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome using App A (the best app selected using the new method) and App B (the app with the highest number of users worldwide). The intervention was performed over 4 months to include at least 3 menstrual cycles. Results: Sixty‐one app users completed the 16‐week intervention. While users rated both apps as higher in quality than previously used menstrual apps, only App A users showed significant improvements in overall satisfaction, app outcome expectancy, the number of days with records, app social influence, intent to recommend, and the possibility of behavioral or cognitive changes in their symptom management. The number of menus used increased over time. While the app self‐efficacy and the number of relief methods did not significantly differ between groups, they still showed an increase in App A users. Conclusions: When a menstrual app reflected users' needs, they recorded their symptoms more often and reported higher app quality, satisfaction, and intention to recommend. This study can not only benefit the selection of menstrual apps, but also confirm that mobile health apps can improve health‐related factors.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of speed‐interactive pedaling training (SIPT) using a smartphone virtual reality application to improve lower limb motor function, trunk sitting balance, and gait in stroke patients. Forty‐two patients who had previously experienced a stroke and could sit independently participated in the study. The subjects were assigned to the SIPT group (n = 21) and the control group (n = 21). The SIPT group had cycle training with SIPT for 40 min a day, five days a week, in a six‐week period, in addition to conventional therapy. The control group had cycle training without SIPT and conventional therapy. The Fuglâ€“Meyer Assessment, postural sway, modified functional reach test, trunk impairment scale, and spatiotemporal parameters of gait were used to assess the changes in lower extremity function, the static balance of sitting, the dynamic balance of sitting, and gait ability after the intervention. The Fuglâ€“Meyer Assessment, postural sway, modified functional reach test, trunk impairment scale, and gait ability in the SIPT group were significantly better compared to that of the control group (p < 0.05). Based on this result, we propose that SIPT, which improves function, balance, and gait, could be used as an effective training method to improve patientsâ€™ functional activities in the clinical setting. The results of this study suggest that SIPT could be used as an effective training method to restore a patientâ€™s function by improving trunk balance and motor function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of using a smartphone application for weight loss as well as a change in health‐related behavior in patients with colorectal polyps over 3 months. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled pilot trial. SETTING: The Department of Family Medicine, Myongji Hospital, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Goyang, Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 25‐65years who were diagnosed with colorectal polyps. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of smartphone application data, with exercise and food intake diary data over 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were weight reduction and an increase in physical activity. Secondary outcomes included changes in dietary intake, such as that of vegetables, fruits, and fatty food. ANALYSIS: Student t test was used for continuous variables, and chi‐square test for categorical variables. RESULTS: Participants using the smartphone application experienced significant weight reduction compared with participants in the control group (mean change = ‐1.25vs ‐0.42 kg; SD = 0.42vs 1.23 kg). Moreover, use of the application and strict adherence to it significantly increased the level of physical activity (mean change = 1.57vs 0.71 strenuous exercises/wk; SD = 1.09vs 0.96 strenuous exercise/wk). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Smartphone applications could be potential tools for weight control and physical activity in patients with colorectal polyps. Future larger randomized, controlled trials over a prolonged period are warranted to confirm these findings.

AB  - Controlling type 2 diabetes (T2DM) requires a comprehensive approach including patient education, self‐monitoring of blood glucose, individualized behavioral strategies, and frequent contact with healthcare professionals (HCPs). We aimed to compare the efficacy of a personalized lifestyle intervention based on a mobile phone application with regular care in participants with T2DM. This is an ongoing randomized controlled open‐label parallel‐group trial with a target accrual of 282 participants, of which 181 have been enrolled to date. Participants are randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) regular care; (2) mobile diabetes management; or (3) mobile diabetes management with HCP feedback. The mobile application is enabled to integrate with both electronic medical records (EMR) and a web‐based diabetes management system for HCPs. It can send customized messages based on participants’ responses to lifestyle questionnaires administered at the baseline. The intervention period is 26 weeks followed by observation for 26 weeks. We evaluate the intervention’s features in order to assess its clinical utility and efficacy and compare outcomes with regular care considering relevant clinical factors, such as age, baseline HbA1c, etc. We expect our study to provide new evidence in support of customized mobile application tools for the management of T2DM.

AB  - Background: The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has led to a significant health burden. Technological advancements have highlighted the benefits of digital therapeutics for chronic diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of a mobile application on weight reduction in patients with T2DM. Methods: A total of 48 patients with T2DM was included in this single-center, randomized, controlled trial. In addition to conventional treatment, participants in the intervention group used a mobile application-based self-management system for diet, exercise, and medication adherence. The primary outcome of this study was weight change after 3 months of intervention, and secondary outcomes were metabolic parameters. Results: After 12 weeks, no significant differences in body weight change were observed between the intervention and control groups (P=0.235). However, a significant difference was found in waist circumference (WC) between the two groups, wherein the control group showed an increase in WC (from 95.00+/-8.89 cm to 95.76+/-9.72 cm), while the intervention group showed a reduction (from 91.93+/-6.25 cm to 90.75+/-6.01 cm) with a significant timexgroup interaction (P=0.016). Additionally, participants with good compliance exhibited a more evident reduction in WC (P=0.037). However, no significant differences were found in other metabolic parameters between the two groups. Conclusion: Lifestyle modification using short-term mobile applications effectively reduced WC, especially in patients with good adherence to the application. However, weight reduction was not achieved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a smartphone application (app) to monitor longitudinal electronic patient‐reported outcomes (ePROs) on patient satisfaction and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We conducted a 6‐month randomized controlled trial of care coordination along with an app (intervention) versus care coordination alone (control) in 191 RA patients. Participants in the intervention group were prompted to provide information daily using ePROs. In both the intervention and control groups, a care coordinator contacted participants at 6 and 18 weeks to assess for flares. The main outcome measures were the global satisfaction score from the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), the score from the Perceived Efficacy in Patient‐Physician Interactions (PEPPI) Questionnaire, and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score. RESULTS: Groups were similar at baseline. The median TSQM score at 6 months was 83.3 in both groups, and the median PEPPI score at 6 months was 50 in both groups. The median CDAI score at 6 months was 8 in the intervention group versus 10 in the control group. No statistically significant group differences in the medians of TSQM, PEPPI, or CDAI scores at 6 months were detected. Of the 67 intervention participants who completed the exit survey, 90% rated their likelihood of recommending the app as ≥7 of 10. Of the 11 physicians who completed the exit survey, 73% agreed/strongly agreed that they wanted to continue offering the app to patients. CONCLUSION: A mobile app designed to collect ePRO data on RA symptoms did not significantly improve patient satisfaction or disease activity compared to care coordination alone. However, both patients and physicians reported positive experiences with the app.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of app use on urinary incontinence control through pelvic floor muscle training when compared to the postal treatment plan. The secondary objectives were to evaluate how app use may affect the quality of life (QoL) of users and treatment adherence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight databases (PubMed, SciELO, Embase, Web of Science, LILACS, Open Gray, Open Thesis, and OATD) were used as research sources. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD 42020145709). Randomized controlled trials assessing urinary incontinence (UI) control with app use, with no restriction of year, language, and status of publication were included. The JBI Systematic Reviews Checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials assessed the risk of bias of the studies selected. The mean scores of QoL between the pre- and postintervention periods were compared through standardized mean differences, which were weighted according to the number of months between the two periods. RESULTS: Only three studies met the eligibility criteria and were included. The methodological quality of the studies was from "low" to "moderate" risk of bias. The full sample included 203 patients with app-based treatment e 203 controls of postal treatment. All studies showed the reduction of urinary symptoms. In addition, two studies showed a reduction of QoL scores specific for the condition, while one study presented increased scores. CONCLUSION: Reminder therapy seems to be a promising strategy for controlling UI.

AB  - Mobile apps provide a promising format for delivering acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to improve diet/exercise. This pilot trial evaluated a novel ACT-based app for health behaviors based on the matrix approach. A sample of 23 community adults were randomly assigned to use the app for two weeks or to a waitlist condition. Findings indicated a high degree of satisfaction with the app and acceptable adherence. Although the intent-to-treat sample indicated few intervention effects, when focusing on program engagers only, health behaviors significantly improved in the app condition relative to waitlist. There were no differences between conditions on valued action or experiential avoidance. However, the rate of valued actions increased over days using the app. This was moderated by baseline values and experiential avoidance, suggesting those more psychologically flexible benefit more from the matrix app. An ACT matrix app appears promising for improving health behaviors, but additional revisions and research is needed.

AB  - There are ongoing questions regarding the similarities and differences in the clinical impact and processes of change for cognitive restructuring and cognitive defusion. This clinical component test compared 87 adults high in self‐criticism randomized to a cognitive defusion mobile app, restructuring app, or waitlist condition for 2 weeks. Equivalent improvements were found from the defusion and restructuring apps relative to the waitlist on self‐criticism and distress as well as decentering, self‐compassion, and dysfunctional attitudes. However, the defusion condition had a more consistent pattern of improvements relative to waitlist. Improvements in cognitive decentering, self‐compassion, and dysfunctional attitudes mediated effects for cognitive defusion relative to waitlist. These mediators were inconsistent for cognitive restructuring. Improvements in self‐compassion and cognitive decentering correlated with improvements in outcomes in the defusion condition, but not the restructuring condition. Overall, these results suggest mobile apps providing cognitive defusion and cognitive restructuring strategies are equally effective, but work through distinct processes of change.

AB  - There is growing evidence for the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) interventions delivered through smartphones, but research has not yet focused on how to optimize such interventions. One benefit of mobile interventions is the ability to adapt content based on in-the-moment variables. The current randomized controlled trial evaluated whether an ACT app that tailored skill coaching based on in-the-moment ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) would be more efficacious than the same app where skill coaching was random or an EMA-only condition. A sample of 69 adults interested in using a self-help app were randomized to one of three app conditions and used the app for the following 4 weeks. Results indicated equivalently high user satisfaction with the tailored versus random apps. Participants used the EMA-only app the most and the tailored app the least, but overall adherence was adequate. Participants in the tailored app improved significantly more on psychological distress and positive mental health relative to the random app and EMA-only conditions. However, no differences were found between the random app and EMA-only conditions on outcomes. Between-group differences over time were also found on psychological inflexibility, but this appeared to be primarily due to a lower rate of improvement in the random app condition relative to both tailored and EMA-only. Overall, these results suggest that tailoring ACTskill coaching based on in-the-moment variables leads to greater efficacy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mobile apps are promising for teaching how to practice psychological skills in high‐risk and in vivo momentary situations, but there has been minimal research on the immediate effects of app‐based skill coaching on mental health in‐the‐moment. This study analyzed the mobile app data in a non‐clinical sample of 39 adults participating in a larger randomized controlled trial, with participants randomized to an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) mobile app that tailors skill coaching based on in‐the‐moment variables (n = 17) or an app that provides randomly selected skill coaching (n = 22). Data were collected before and after each ACT skill coaching session on proximal outcome (depression, anxiety, and engagement in meaningful activity) and ACT process variables. Multilevel models indicated significant immediate improvements on average following ACT skill coaching sessions on all proximal outcome and ACT process variables, although with relatively small effects ranging between 0.17 and 0.27 SD units change. Larger immediate pre‐to‐post effects from ACT coaching sessions were found for anxiety, experiential avoidance, and cognitive fusion in the tailored app versus random app condition. Overall, results suggest that an ACT app can have immediate, in‐the‐moment effects on psychological functioning, which may be enhanced by tailoring skills to current context.

AB  - Objectives: College counseling centers face significant challenges meeting the mental health needs of their students and waitlists are common. Mobile apps offer a promising solution to increase access to resources while students wait for services. Methods: This pilot randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a publicly available mindfulness app. Students on a counseling center waitlist (nâ€‰=â€‰23) were randomized to use the app or not, with assessments completed over four weeks. Results: Recruitment over three semesters was slow, leading to an underpowered trial. Participants reported high satisfaction and moderate app usage. Very preliminary support was found for potential app efficacy relative to the control condition, particularly for depression, anxiety, and overall distress. Weaker, mixed effects were found for mindfulness and values processes. Conclusions: Overall, these results provide mixed findings suggesting the potential benefits, but also challenges in using a mindfulness app for students waiting to receive counseling services.

AB  - This randomized controlled trial evaluated the acceptability and additive effects of self‐monitoring avoidant and valued functions of behavior, in the context of self‐monitoring physical activity and dietary behavior in a mobile app. The self‐monitoring approach was based on the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) Matrix. A sample of 102 adults interested in improving their diet and physical activity were randomized to a Health Behavior Tracking app (HBT), HBT plus ACT matrix app (HBT+ACT), or waitlist condition. Online self‐report assessments were completed at baseline, mid (2 weeks), and post‐intervention (4 weeks). Participants reported high usability, but mixed satisfaction with both apps. About half of the prompted app check‐ins were completed on average, with 14% never using the ACT app. Participants in the HBT+ACT app condition reported greater self‐reported physical activity over time relative to HBT and waitlist, potentially due to protecting against a decrease over time in physical activity observed in the other two conditions. HBT and HBT+ACT conditions both improved self‐reported sedentary behavior relative to waitlist. HBT+ACT improved cognitive restraint with eating more than HBT. Neither the HBT or HBT+ACT app improved other health behavior outcome measures or values processes relative to the waitlist. Overall, findings suggest some benefits of the ACT Matrix app for addressing physical activity by tracking valued/avoidant functions, but mixed findings on acceptability, outcomes, and processes of change suggests impact may be relatively limited.

AB  - A process‐based therapy approach emphasizes examining how and for whom specific therapeutic components linked to specific processes of change function. This preliminary study explored the processes of change for cognitive defusion and restructuring with daily ratings of self‐criticism from a larger component trial as well as self‐compassion as a moderator of these daily effects. A sample of 51 adults high in self‐criticism (M age = 22.69, 78% female, 88% non‐Hispanic White) were randomized to a cognitive defusion or restructuring mobile app for two weeks and completed daily assessments. Both conditions improved over time on daily frequency, defused noticing, challenging, and believability of self‐critical thoughts as well as valued actions, with larger improvements in the defusion condition only for thought frequency and defused noticing. Global self‐compassion moderated several effects such that only participants lower in self‐compassion improved over time on daily self‐criticism processes in the restructuring condition, while effects over time in the defusion condition generally did not vary by level of self‐compassion. Improvements in daily frequency, defused noticing, and challenging self‐critical thoughts as well as valued action each predicted global improvements in self‐criticism at post‐intervention across conditions. Overall, these preliminary results suggest cognitive defusion and restructuring may have some similar effects on self‐criticism related processes of change, particularly for those low in self‐compassion. However, defusion may produce larger effects on some targeted processes, especially among those with higher self‐compassion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of worldwide years lost because of disability, with a tremendous economic burden for health care systems. Digital therapeutic care (DTC) programs provide a scalable, universally accessible, and low-cost approach to the multidisciplinary treatment of LBP. Moreover, novel decision support interventions such as personalized feedback messages, push notifications, and data-driven activity recommendations amplify DTC by guiding the user through the program while aiming to increase overall engagement and sustainable behavior change. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to synthesize recent scientific literature on the impact of DTC apps for people with LBP and outline the implementation of add-on decision support interventions, including their effect on user retention and attrition rates. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database, from March 1, 2016, to October 15, 2020, in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and conducted this review based on related previously published systematic reviews. Besides randomized controlled trials (RCTs), we also included study designs with the evidence level of at least a retrospective comparative study. This enables the consideration of real-world user-generated data and provides information regarding the adoption and effectiveness of DTC apps in a real-life setting. For the appraisal of the risk of bias, we used the Risk of Bias 2 Tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool for the RCTs and nonrandomized trials, respectively. The included studies were narratively synthesized regarding primary and secondary outcome measures, DTC components, applied decision support interventions, user retention, and attrition rates. RESULTS: We retrieved 1388 citations, of which 12 studies are included in this review. Of the 12 studies, 6 (50%) were RCTs and 6 (50%) were nonrandomized trials. In all included studies, lower pain levels and increased functionality compared with baseline values were observed in the DTC intervention group. A between-group comparison revealed significant improvements in pain and functionality levels in 67% (4/6) of the RCTs. The study population was mostly homogeneous, with predominantly female, young to middle-aged participants of normal to moderate weight. The methodological quality assessment revealed moderate to high risks of biases, especially in the nonrandomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review demonstrates the benefits of DTC for people with LBP. There is also evidence that decision support interventions benefit overall engagement with the app and increase participants' ability to self-manage their recovery process. Finally, including retrospective evaluation studies of real-world user-generated data in future systematic reviews of digital health intervention trials can reveal new insights into the benefits, challenges, and real-life adoption of DTC programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional dietary recommendations for achieving optimal gestational weight gain are ineffective for pregnant women due to the lack of real‐time communication and tedious consultation processes. OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we aimed to determine the feasibility of a novel food‐coaching smartphone app for controlling gestational weight gain and macronutrient intake among overweight and obese pregnant women. METHODS: We designed a randomized controlled trial and recruited 30 overweight and obese pregnant women (1:1 ratio) during 18‐20 weeks of gestation and followed them up after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Both groups received standard pregnancy dietary orientation at recruitment, while the intervention group received 8 weeks of real‐time food coaching via a smartphone app. This food‐coaching smartphone app (Glycoleap, Holmusk, Singapore) aimed to improve care and outcomes for people with diabetes. Pregnant women using this app were able to upload food images (eg, a picture of a meal, a drink, or a dessert) and received real‐time and detailed food‐coaching comments and guidance provided by professional dietitians during the day (8 AM to 8 PM). We recorded detailed characteristics during recruitment and examined anthropometry at all visits. We compared the mean differences of the 8‐week gestational weight gain and macronutrient intake between the two groups. RESULTS: Upon study completion, three subjects dropped out from the intervention, and one gave birth prematurely in the control group. The acceptance rate of the smartphone app was 90%. More participants achieved optimal gestational weight gain per week in the intervention group (8/12, 67%) than in the control group (5/14, 36%). After the 8‐week intervention, women in the intervention group appeared to have lower gestational weight gain (mean difference=‐0.08 kg; 95% CI ‐1.80 to 1.63) and cholesterol intake (mean difference=‐31.73 mg; 95% CI ‐102.91 to 39.45) than those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that this food‐coaching smartphone app is feasible and favorable for weight gain control and cholesterol intake control among overweight and obese pregnant women. Although our results were not significant (perhaps, attributed to the small sample size), it provided proof of concept for the feasibility of applying such technology in future randomized controlled trials with a larger sample size, an earlier intervention onset, and a longer follow‐up for overweight and obese pregnant women.

AB  - QUESTION: To determine the uptake of an app‐based supplemental exercise programme in a rehabilitation setting and the effect of such a programme on length of stay and function compared to usual care physiotherapy. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with random allocation and assessor blinding. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 144 individuals with mixed diagnoses (orthopaedic, neurological, reconditioning) admitted for inpatient sub‐acute rehabilitation. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to usual care physiotherapy (control group) or usual care physiotherapy with the addition of an app‐based supplemental exercise programme (intervention group). OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of interest was total supplementary exercise dosage completed by the intervention group. The primary between‐group outcome measure was length of stay with secondary measures including walking endurance (Six‐Minute Walk Test), walking speed (10‐Metre Walk Test), functional mobility (Timed Up and Go Test) and level of disability (Functional Independence Measure). RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group performed 7 minutes (SD: 9) or 49 repetitions (SD: 48) of supplementary exercise using the app each day. There were no differences between the groups for length of stay (mean difference (MD): ‐0.5 days, 95% confidence interval (CI): ‐3.2 to 2.2) or change in any secondary functional outcome measures, including walking speed (MD: ‐0.1 m/s, 95% CI: ‐0.2 to 0.0) and disability (MD: ‐0.9, 95% CI: ‐3.6 to 1.8). CONCLUSION: A small supplementary exercise dose was achieved by participants in the intervention group. However, such a programme did not affect length of stay or functional outcomes when compared to usual care.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment has adverse impact on the social and role functions of those at clinical high risk for psychosis and it has become an important target for intervention. Mobile health applications are user‐friendly, real‐time, personalized and portable in administering cognitive training and have promising application prospects in the field of mental health. Methods: Eighty CHR subjects were randomized into an intervention group and a control group. CHR subjects of the intervention group performed attention and memory training via a Specific Memory Attention Resource and Training (SMART) application in their smart phones for 10 min per day, five days per week for three months. Both groups were followed up for three months. At baseline and follow‐up phases, cognitive function was measured using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). In the follow‐up, the intervention group completed the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) to provide feedback to improve SMART. Results: There is a significant group by time interaction effect in the Attention/Vigilance domain, which is significantly better in the intervention group than in the control group at 3‐ month follow‐up. The improvement in Attention/Vigilance in the intervention group is significantly related to the amount of cognitive training time. Global Assessment of Function (GAF) reduction rate at baseline could predict the improvement of Attention/Vigilance. MARS results indicate that CHR subjects were receptive of SMART. Conclusion: Mobile technology can be applied to improve cognitive function of CHR individuals, especially in the Attention/Vigilance domain.

AB  - Objective To determine whether the Perx app improves medication adherence and clinical outcomes over 12 months compared with standard care in patients requiring polypharmacy. Design Randomised controlled trial with 12‐month follow‐up. Setting Outpatient clinics in three tertiary hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Participants Eligible participants were aged 18‐75 years, with at least one chronic condition, taking ≥3 different medications (oral medications or injections), with smartphone accessibility. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Interventions The intervention group used the Perx app that contained customised reminders and gamified interactions to reward verified medication adherence. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was medication adherence over 12 months measured using pill counts. Secondary outcomes included clinical outcomes (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), cholesterol, blood glucose, triglycerides, creatinine, thyroid function, blood pressure and weight). Results Of 1412 participants screened for eligibility, 124 participants were randomised; 45 in the Perx arm and 40 in the control arm completed the study. The average age was 59.5, 58.9% were women, chronic conditions were cardiovascular disease (78%), type 2 diabetes (75%), obesity (65%) or other endocrine disorders (18%). On average, participants were taking six medications daily. The Perx group had greater improvements in adherence at month 2 (Coef. 8%; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.15), month 3 (Coef. 7%; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.14) and month 12 (Coef. 7%; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.13). The probability of HbA1c ≤6.5% was greater in the Perx group at months 9 and 12 and cholesterol (total and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol) was lower in the Perx group at month 3. The intervention was particularly effective for those with obesity, taking medications for diabetes and taking ≤4 medications. Conclusions This study provides evidence that app‐based behavioural change interventions can increase medication adherence and produce longer‐term improvements in some clinical outcomes in adults managing multimorbidity. More trials are needed to build the evidence base. Trial registration number ACTRN12617001285347.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) reaches up to 30% in the Asian adult population, with a higher prevalence in obese patients. Weight reduction is typically recommended for patients at high risk or diagnosed with NAFLD, but is a challenge to achieve. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention with a mobile app on weight loss in NAFLD patients. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial included 108 adults with NAFLD confirmed by steatosis on ultrasound and a body mass index â‰¥23 kg/m2 who were recruited from a fatty liver outpatient clinic. The patients were randomly allocated to either a control group (n=53) receiving standard care, consisting of dietary and lifestyle advice by a trained nurse, or an intervention group (n=55) utilizing the Nutritionist Buddy (nBuddy) mobile app in addition to receiving dietary and lifestyle advice by a dietitian. Body weight, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), waist circumference, and blood pressure were measured at baseline, and then at 3 and 6 months. Intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol analyses were used for statistical comparisons. RESULTS: The intervention group had a 5‐fold higher likelihood (relative risk 5.2, P=.003, 95% CI 1.8‐15.4) of achieving â‰¥5% weight loss compared to the control group at 6 months. The intervention group also showed greater reductions in weight (mean 3.2, SD 4.1 kg vs mean 0.5, SD 2.9 kg; P<.001), waist circumference (mean 2.9, SD 5.0 cm vs mean ‐0.7, SD 4.4 cm; P<.001), systolic blood pressure (mean 12.4, SD 14.8 mmHg vs mean 2.4, SD 12.4 mmHg; P=.003), diastolic blood pressure (mean 6.8, SD 8.9 mmHg vs mean ‐0.9, SD 10.0 mmHg; P=.001), ALT (mean 33.5, SD 40.4 IU/L vs mean 11.5, SD 35.2 IU/L; P=.004), and AST (mean 17.4, SD 27.5 U/L vs mean 7.4, SD 17.6 IU/L, P=.03) at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle intervention enabled by a mobile app can be effective in improving anthropometric indices and liver enzymes in patients with NAFLD. This treatment modality has the potential to be extended to a larger population scale.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Lifestyle interventions aimed at postpartum weight loss to reduce T2DM risk have been reported, but poor compliance remains a barrier. Smartphone‐based interventions may improve compliance, but data on its use in women with recent GDM are limited. OBJECTIVE: This trial aimed to investigate the efficacy of a smartphone app in restoring optimal weight following delivery in women with GDM, in the setting of a population with high rates of GDM and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, 200 women with GDM were randomized to receive the intervention or standard care following delivery. The intervention enabled logging of weight, meals, and activity, with web‐based interaction with a team comprising dieticians, a physiotherapist, and an occupational therapist. The primary outcome was an achievement of optimal weight (defined as the restoration of first trimester weight if first trimester BMI≤23 kg/m2 or weight loss of at least 5% from first trimester weight if first trimester BMI>23 kg/m2) at 4 months post partum. Secondary outcome measures included absolute weight loss, serum metabolic markers, self‐reported nutritional intake, health education, and quality of life via questionnaires and user engagement in the intervention group. RESULTS: In total, 40% (38/96) of women in the intervention group achieved optimal weight at 4 months post delivery compared with 32% (28/93) in the control group (P=.27). Compared with the control group, women in the intervention group reported significantly reduced caloric intake at 4 months after delivery (P<.001) and higher health‐directed behavior scores (P=.045). The intervention group also reported increased emotional distress scores (P=.01). At 4 months, participant engagement with the intervention was maintained at 60.8% (SD 33.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Although a statistically significant increase in women achieving healthy weight was not observed, this app remains promising, as women in the intervention group reported improved health behaviors and lower caloric intake. Importantly, the high retention rates suggest that a larger study with a longer follow‐up period might confirm the effectiveness of this app for weight management.

AB  - Importance: Lifestyle interventions are effective in diabetes management, with smartphone apps that manage health data and dietary and exercise schedules gaining popularity. However, limited evidence from randomized clinical trials exists regarding the effectiveness of smartphone‐based interventions among Asian adults with type 2 diabetes. Objective: To compare the effects of a culturally contextualized smartphone‐based intervention with usual care on weight and metabolic outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial conducted at multiple primary care centers in Singapore included 305 adults with type 2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) of 23 or greater who had literacy in English and smartphone access. Participants were recruited between October 3, 2017, and September 9, 2019, and were randomly assigned (1:1; stratified by gender, age, and BMI) to intervention (99 participants) or control (105 participants) groups. Participants' data were analyzed using intention‐to‐treat analysis. Interventions: Both control and intervention participants received diet and physical activity advice from a dietitian at a baseline face‐to‐face visit. Intervention participants additionally used a smartphone app to track weight, diet, physical activity, and blood glucose and then communicated with dietitians for 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was change in body weight, while secondary outcomes were changes in hemoglobin A1c(HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, and diet. Post hoc analyses included glycemic changes in the subgroup with HbA1clevels of 8% or greater and diabetes medication changes. Results: Among the 204 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 51.2 [9.7] years; 132 [64.7%] men), baseline mean (SD) BMI was 30.6 (4.3). Compared with the control group, intervention participants achieved significantly greater reductions in weight (mean [SD] change, ‐3.6 [4.7] kg vs ‐1.2 [3.6] kg) and HbA1clevels (mean [SD] change, ‐0.7% [1.2] vs ‐0.3% [1.0]), with a greater proportion having a reduction in diabetes medications (17 participants [23.3%] vs 4 participants [5.4%]) at 6 months. The intervention led to a greater HbA1creduction among participants with HbA1clevels of 8% or higher (mean [SD] change, ‐1.8% [1.4] vs ‐1.0% [1.4]; P =.001). Intergroup differences favoring the intervention were also noted for fasting blood glucose, diastolic blood pressure, and dietary changes. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a smartphone‐based lifestyle intervention was more effective in achieving weight and glycemic reductions among Asian adults with type 2 diabetes compared with usual care, supporting the use of apps in lifestyle intervention delivery.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the long‐term effectiveness of the Care & Organize Our Lifestyle (COOL) programme, a self‐regulation theory‐based mHealth programme, on improving disease knowledge and physical activity in youth with congenital heart disease (CHD). DESIGN: A three‐arm parallel‐group randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A total 143 participants with simple and moderate CHD aged 15‐24 years were recruited from June 2016 to February 2018. The 12‐month programme compared two active intervention groups to a standard‐care control group (n = 47). Participants in one active intervention group (n = 49) were provided with COOL Passport, a mobile healthcare application. Those in the other group (n = 47) were provided with access to the Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game‐based interactive platforms along with COOL Passport. Outcomes were the Leuven Knowledge Questionnaire for Congenital Heart Disease and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire‐Taiwan Show‐Card Version. RESULTS: After 12 months, 103 participants remained; the overall attrition rate was 28%. No significant differences were observed between the groups in any domain of disease knowledge after 6 months or 1 year. Neither active group exhibited significantly greater physical activity intensity than the standard‐care control group in any month during the 1 year. CONCLUSION: The mHealth‐tailored intervention of the COOL programme did not improve disease knowledge or physical activity in young adults with CHD. IMPACT: The application of the COOL Passport and Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game‐based interactive platforms must be modified and verified in future studies and may have clinical potential. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The registry of clinical trials was ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04264650.

AB  - Although impressive progress has been made toward developing empirically-supported psychological treatments, the reality remains that a significant proportion of people with mental health problems do not receive these treatments. Finding ways to reduce this treatment gap is crucial. Since app-supported smartphone interventions are touted as a possible solution, access to up-to-date guidance around the evidence base and clinical utility of these interventions is needed. We conducted a meta-analysis of 66 randomized controlled trials of app-supported smartphone interventions for mental health problems. Smartphone interventions significantly outperformed control conditions in improving depressive (g=0.28, n=54) and generalized anxiety (g=0.30, n=39) symptoms, stress levels (g=0.35, n=27), quality of life (g=0.35, n=43), general psychiatric distress (g=0.40, n=12), social anxiety symptoms (g=0.58, n=6), and positive affect (g=0.44, n=6), with most effects being robust even after adjusting for various possible biasing factors (type of control condition, risk of bias rating). Smartphone interventions conferred no significant benefit over control conditions on panic symptoms (g=-0.05, n=3), post-traumatic stress symptoms (g=0.18, n=4), and negative affect (g=-0.08, n=5). Studies that delivered a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)-based app and offered professional guidance and reminders to engage produced larger effects on multiple outcomes. Smartphone interventions did not differ significantly from active interventions (face-to-face, computerized treatment), although the number of studies was low (n≤13). The efficacy of app-supported smartphone interventions for common mental health problems was thus confirmed. Although mental health apps are not intended to replace professional clinical services, the present findings highlight the potential of apps to serve as a cost-effective, easily accessible, and low intensity intervention for those who cannot receive standard psychological treatment.

AB  - The potential health benefits of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion are well-documented. However, interventions that teach these principles typically rely on face-to-face delivery, which can limit their dissemination. Delivering these interventions through smartphone apps could help overcome this. This meta-analysis examined whether principles of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion can be learned through smartphone apps. Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials were included. Smartphone apps that included acceptance and/or mindfulness components resulted in significantly higher levels of acceptance/mindfulness than comparison conditions (k = 33; g = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.17, 0.41). These effects were moderated by the type of comparison and whether reminders to engage were offered. Smartphone apps also resulted in significantly lower levels of psychological distress than comparisons (k = 22; g = −0.32; 95% CI = −0.48, −0.16). Meta-regression revealed a negative relationship between the effect sizes for mindfulness/acceptance and the effect sizes for distress. Smartphone apps produced significantly greater increases in self-compassion than comparisons (k = 9; g = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.56), although the quality of RCTs in this analysis was poor. Findings suggest that principles of acceptance, mindfulness, and self-compassion may be learned through cheap, easily accessible, and low-intensity interventions delivered via smartphone apps. However, the quality of available evidence is poor, as low risk of bias was noted in few trials (18%) and the observed effects were likely explained by a digital placebo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although effective treatments exist for diagnostic and subthreshold‐level eating disorders (EDs), a significant proportion of affected individuals do not receive help. Interventions translated for delivery through smartphone apps may be one solution towards reducing this treatment gap. However, evidence for the efficacy of smartphones apps for EDs is lacking. We developed a smartphone app based on the principles and techniques of transdiagnostic cognitive‐behavioral therapy for EDs and evaluated it through a pre‐registered randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Symptomatic individuals (those who reported the presence of binge eating) were randomly assigned to the app (n = 197) or waiting list (n = 195). Of the total sample, 42 and 31% exhibited diagnostic‐level bulimia nervosa and binge‐eating disorder symptoms, respectively. Assessments took place at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks post‐randomization. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. The primary outcome was global levels of ED psychopathology. Secondary outcomes were other ED symptoms, impairment, and distress. RESULTS: Intervention participants reported greater reductions in global ED psychopathology than the control group at post‐test (d = ‐0.80). Significant effects were also observed for secondary outcomes (d's = ‐0.30 to ‐0.74), except compensatory behavior frequency. Symptom levels remained stable at follow‐up. Participants were largely satisfied with the app, although the overall post‐test attrition rate was 35%. CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the potential for this app to serve as a cost‐effective and easily accessible intervention for those who cannot receive standard treatment. The capacity for apps to be flexibly integrated within current models of mental health care delivery may prove vital for addressing the unmet needs of people with EDs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Existing internet‐based prevention and treatment programmes for binge eating are composed of multiple distinct modules that are designed to target a broad range of risk or maintaining factors. Such multi‐modular programmes (1) may be unnecessarily long for those who do not require a full course of intervention and (2) make it difficult to distinguish those techniques that are effective from those that are redundant. Since dietary restraint is a well‐replicated risk and maintaining factor for binge eating, we developed an internet‐ and app‐based intervention composed solely of cognitive‐behavioural techniques designed to modify dietary restraint as a mechanism to target binge eating. We tested the efficacy of this combined selective and indicated prevention programme in 403 participants, most of whom were highly symptomatic (90% reported binge eating once per week). METHOD: Participants were randomly assigned to the internet intervention (n = 201) or an informational control group (n = 202). The primary outcome was objective binge‐eating frequency. Secondary outcomes were indices of dietary restraint, shape, weight, and eating concerns, subjective binge eating, disinhibition, and psychological distress. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. RESULTS: Intervention participants reported greater reductions in objective binge‐eating episodes compared to the control group at post‐test (small effect size). Significant effects were also observed on each of the secondary outcomes (small to large effect sizes). Improvements were sustained at 8 week follow‐up. CONCLUSIONS: Highly focused digital interventions that target one central risk/maintaining factor may be sufficient to induce meaningful change in core eating disorder symptoms.

AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of mobile technology on treatment outcome for psychotherapy and other behavioral interventions. Our search of the literature resulted in 26 empirical articles describing 25 clinical trials testing the benefits of smartphone applications, personal digital assistants (PDAs), or text messaging systems either to supplement treatment or substitute for direct contact with a clinician. Overall, mobile technology use was associated with superior treatment outcome across all study designs and control conditions, effect size (ES) = .34, p < .0001. For the subset of 10 studies that looked specifically at the added benefit of mobile technology using a rigorous 'Treatment' versus 'Treatment + Mobile' design, effect sizes were only slightly more modest (ES = .27) and still significant (p < .05). Overall, the results support the role of mobile technology for the delivery of psychotherapy and other behavioral interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Research has shown that mobile phones can help with management of numerous health problems. As an adjunct to care management provided to injured service members rehabilitating in their communities, particularly those with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), post‐traumatic stress (PTS), and/or behavioral health problems, the Army developed a mobile phone application called "mCare." This study examined whether service members who received mCare had higher well‐being, were more satisfied with their care, and viewed mCare as a valuable part of their care management as compared with their counterparts who received standard care management alone, and whether those with mTBI, PTS, and/or behavioral health problems benefited differently from mCare. Materials and Methods: In‐processing service members at four community‐based warrior transition units were recruited for participation in a 36‐wk, randomized, controlled trial and allocated to receive standard care management plus mCare (n = 95) or standard care management alone (n = 87). Participants in the mCare group received daily questionnaires, tips, and appointment reminders. All participants were asked to complete the General Well‐being Schedule (GWS) at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 wk, and the Case Management Quality Questionnaire (CMQQ) at 12, 24, and 36 wk. All participants and care managers were approached to complete interviews about the usability/likeability of mCare or standard care management. The analyses tested for group differences in completion of the intervention, graphed means for the GWS and CMQQ by group/subgroup, and statistically compared the longitudinal trends in these outcomes using mixed models in which group, time, and group*time were included as regression variables. The analyses also tallied interview responses and identified thematic quotes. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center's Institutional Review Board. Results: Estimated rate of change in GWS scores was ‐2.2 (standard error = 1.0; t = ‐2.1; p = 0.0382). Estimated rate of change in CMQQ scores was ‐0.8 (standard error = 0.5; t = ‐1.52; p = 0.1299). Neither change was meaningful. Rates of change in the GWS and CMQQ scores did not differ by group or by behavioral health, mTBI, and PTS subgroups within the groups. The interviews found that 83% of mCare participants liked the communication with their care managers versus 73% of standard care management participants. Participants in both the mCare group and the care managers said that they liked the application's appointment tracking and reminders. Care managers thought mCare was particularly useful for people with mTBI, PTS, and cognitive problems. Conclusion: mCare did not result in differences in general well‐being and satisfaction with care management among service members rehabilitating in their communities, some with mTBI, PTS, and/or behavioral health problems. But participants and care managers who used mCare said that they found it useful. Study limitations included the diversity of clinical issues of the participants, greater missing data among mCare participants, and the high baseline quality of care management in the settings observed. The fact that patients and care managers liked mCare, apart from no changes in outcomes, is important because health care is increasingly adopting mobile solutions.

AB  - Forty percent of all general‐practitioner appointments are related to mental illness, although less than 35% of individuals have access to therapy and psychological care, indicating a pressing need for accessible and affordable therapy tools. The ubiquity of smartphones offers a delivery platform for such tools. Previous research suggests that gamification—turning intervention content into a game format—could increase engagement with prevention and early‐stage mobile interventions. This study aimed to explore the effects of a gamified mobile mental health intervention on improvements in resilience, in comparison with active and inactive control conditions. Differences between conditions on changes in personal growth, anxiety and psychological wellbeing, as well as differences in attrition rates, were also assessed. The eQuoo app was developed and published on all leading mobile platforms. The app educates users about psychological concepts including emotional bids, generalization, and reciprocity through psychoeducation, storytelling, and gamification. In total, 358 participants completed in a 5‐week, 3‐armed (eQuoo, “treatment as usual” cognitive behavioral therapy journal app, no‐intervention waitlist) randomized controlled trial. Relevant scales were administered to all participants on days 1, 17, and 35. Repeated‐measures ANOVA revealed statistically significant increases in resilience in the test group compared with both control groups over 5 weeks. The app also significantly increased personal growth, positive relations with others, and anxiety. With 90% adherence, eQuoo retained 21% more participants than the control or waitlist groups. Intervention delivered via eQuoo significantly raised mental well‐being and decreased self‐reported anxiety while enhancing adherence in comparison with the control conditions. Mobile apps using gamification can be a valuable and effective platform for well‐being and mental health interventions and may enhance motivation and reduce attrition. Future research should measure eQuoo’s effect on anxiety with a more sensitive tool and examine the impact of eQuoo on a clinical population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of individual-tailored dietary recording in mobile phone health apps has become increasingly important in management of self-health care and population-based preventive service. The development of such mobile apps for user-centered designing is still challengeable and requires further scientific evidence. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a randomized trial to assess the accuracy and time efficiency of two prototypes for dietary recoding utilization related to the input method of food intake. METHODS: We first present an innovative combinatorial concept for dietary recording to account for dish variation. One prototype was a self-chosen tab app that featured choosing each food ingredient to synthesize an individual dish, whereas the other was an autonomous exhaustive list app that provided one selection from a comprehensive list of dish items. The concept included commercially available choices that allowed users to more accurately account for their individual food selection. The two mobile apps were compared in a head-to-head parallel randomized trial evaluation. Young adults (n=70, aged 18-29) and older adults (n=35, aged 55-73) were recruited and randomized into two groups for accuracy and response time evaluation based on 12 types of food items in use of the developed self-chosen tab and autonomous exhaustive list apps, respectively. RESULTS: For the trials based on the self-chosen tab (53 participants) and autonomous exhaustive list groups (52 participants), the two prototypes were found to be highly accurate (>98%). The self-chosen tab app was found to be more efficient, requiring significantly less time for input of 11 of 12 items (P<.05). The self-chosen tab users occasionally neglected to select food attributes, an issue which did not occur in the autonomous exhaustive list group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes through the scientific evaluation of the transformation step into prototype development to demonstrate that a self-chosen tab app has potentially better opportunity in effectiveness and efficiency. The combinatorial concept offers potential for dietary recording and planning which can account for high food item variability. Our findings on prototype development of diversified dietary recordings provide design consideration and user interaction for related further app development and improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile app-assisted self-care interventions are emerging promising tools to support self-care of patients with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The effectiveness of such interventions requires further exploration for more supporting evidence. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to examine the effectiveness of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions developed for type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension in improving patient outcomes. METHODS: We followed the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus for relevant studies published between January 2007 and January 2019. Primary outcomes included changes in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Changes in other clinical-, behavioral-, knowledge-, and psychosocial-related outcomes were included as secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes and objective secondary outcomes that were reported in at least two trials were meta-analyzed; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 27 trials were identified and analyzed. For primary outcomes, the use of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions was associated with significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.44, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.29; P<.001), SBP (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.03, P=.02), and DBP (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.03, P=.02). Subgroup analyses for primary outcomes showed that several intervention features were supportive of self-management, including blood glucose, blood pressure, and medication monitoring, communication with health care providers, automated feedback, personalized goal setting, reminders, education materials, and data visualization. In addition, 8 objective secondary outcomes were meta-analyzed, which showed that the interventions had significant lowering effects on fasting blood glucose levels and waist circumference. A total of 42 secondary outcomes were narratively synthesized, and mixed results were found. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile app-assisted self-care interventions can be effective tools for managing blood glucose and blood pressure, likely because their use facilitates remote management of health issues and data, provision of personalized self-care recommendations, patient-care provider communication, and decision making. More studies are required to further determine which combinations of intervention features are most effective in improving the control of the diseases. Moreover, evidence regarding the effects of these interventions on the behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes of patients is still scarce, which warrants further examination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) severely impairs the physical and mental health of patients, decreasing their self‐efficacy in coping with daily life and quality of life (QOL). In China, a large gap remains between the complex long‐term health needs of SCI patients and the current community care system. With the prevalence of mobile terminals, the usage of mobile health apps has the potential to fill this gap by extending qualified medical resources to the families of SCI patients. Our team developed the app Together for the transitional care of home‐dwelling SCI patients in China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of app‐based transitional care on the self‐efficacy and QOL of SCI patients. METHODS: Through a three‐round Delphi process, an Android app was designed. Both medical staff and patients could access the app. Medical staff used it for providing remote transitional care to SCI patients. Patients used it to view transitional care time and send messages to medical staff. Thereafter, a multicenter and assessor‐blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants (n=98) who had SCI and lived at home following discharge were recruited and randomly assigned to a study group (n=49) and control group (n=49) using a randomized number list in four research centers. Patients in both groups received systematic discharge education before discharge. The study group received five follow‐ups conducted by trained nurses through the app, which had four core functions, namely remote assessment, health education, interdisciplinary referral, and patient interaction, at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 following discharge. The control group received a routine telephone follow‐up conducted by nurses at week 12 following discharge. The outcome measures were the Moorong Self‐Efficacy Scale (MSES) and 36‐item Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐36) scores. Data were collected before discharge (T0) and at weeks 12 (T1) and 24 following discharge (T2). Differences between the groups were tested by repeated measures analysis of variance and simple effect analysis. RESULTS: After the follow‐up, the total MSES scores in the study group improved over time (T0=67.80, T1=71.90, and T2=76.29) and were higher than those in the control group (T2=64.49) at 24 weeks following discharge (simple effect analysis: F1=8.506, P=.004). Regarding the total SF‐36 score, although it was higher in patients from the study group (T2=65.36) than those from the control group (T2=58.77) at 24 weeks following discharge, only time effects were significant (F2,95=6.671, P=.002) and neither the group effects nor the interaction effects influenced the change in QOL (group effects: F1,96=0.082, P=.78; interaction effects: F2,95=3.059, P=.052). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that app‐based transitional care improves the self‐efficacy of SCI patients. Nevertheless, QOL improvement is not yet evident. Future investigations with larger sample sizes and longer observation periods are warranted to further verify the effects.

AB  - Background: Smartphone technology represents an opportunity to deliver practical solutions for people affected by cancer at a scale that was previously unimaginable, such as information, appointment monitoring, and improved access to cancer support services. This study aimed to determine whether a smartphone application (app) reduced the unmet needs among people newly diagnosed with cancer. Methods: A single blind, multisite randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of an app‐based, 4‐month intervention. Newly diagnosed cancer patients were approached at three health service treatment clinics. Results: Eighty‐two people were randomized (intervention; nÂ =Â 43 and control; nÂ =Â 39), average age was 59.5Â years (SD: 12.9); 71% female; 67% married or in a de facto relationship. At baseline, there were no differences in participantsâ€™ characteristics between the groups. No significant effects, in reducing unmet needs, were demonstrated at the end of intervention (4‐month) or 12‐month follow‐up. Overall, 94% used the app in weeks 1‐4, which decreased to 41% in weeks 13‐16. Mean app use time per participant: Cancer Information, 6.9 (SD: 18.9) minutes; Appointment Schedule, 5.1 (SD: 9.6) minutes; Cancer Services 1.5Â minutes (SD: 6.8); Hospital Navigation, 1.4 (SD: 2.8) minutes. Conclusions: Despite consumer involvement in the design of this smartphone technology, the app did not reduce unmet needs. This may have been due to the study being underpowered. To contribute to a meaningful understanding and improved implementation of smartphone technology to support people affected by cancer, practical considerations, such as recruitment issues and access to, and confidence with, apps, need to be considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mobile technologies may be suitable for delivering Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) to treat anxiety in real-time. This review aims to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of EMI for treating anxiety conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four databases and the reference lists of previous studies were searched. A total of 1949 abstracts were double screened for inclusion. Sufficient studies were available to undertake a quantitative meta-analysis on EMIs on generalized anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: The 15 randomized trials and randomized controlled trials examined anxiety (n = 7), stress (n = 3), anxiety and stress (n = 2), panic disorder (n = 2), and social phobia (n = 1). Eight EMIs comprised self-monitoring integrated with therapy modules, seven comprised multimedia content, and three comprised self-monitoring only. The quality of studies presented high risk of biases. Meta-analysis (n = 7) demonstrated that EMIs reduced generalized anxiety compared to control and/or comparison groups (Effect Size (ES) = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.12-0.53). Most EMIs targeting stress were reported effective relative to control as were the two EMIs targeting panic disorders. The EMI targeting social phobia was not effective. DISCUSSION: EMIs have potential in treating both anxiety and stress. However, few high-quality trials have been conducted for specific anxiety disorders. Further trials are needed to assess the value of EMI technologies for anxiety in enhancing existing treatments. CONCLUSION: This study found a small significant effect of EMI studies on reducing generalized anxiety. Studies on stress demonstrated EMI was effective compared to control, with the small number of studies on panic and social phobia demonstrating mixed results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the long‐term effectiveness of app‐based treatment for female stress, urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence (UI) compared to care‐as‐usual in primary care. DESIGN: A pragmatic, randomised controlled, superiority trial. SETTING: Primary care in the Netherlands from 2015 to 2018, follow‐up at 12 months. POPULATION: Women with ?2 UI‐episodes per week, access to mobile apps, wanting treatment. 262 women randomised equally to app or care‐as‐usual; 89 (68%) and 83 (63%) attended one year follow‐up. INTERVENTIONS: The standalone app included conservative management for UI with motivation aids (e.g., reminders). Care‐as‐usual delivered according to the Dutch GP guideline for UI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness assessed by the change in symptom severity score (ICIQ‐UI‐SF) and the change in quality of life (ICIQ‐LUTS‐QoL) with linear regression on an intention‐to‐treat basis. RESULTS: Clinically relevant improvement of UI severity for both app (‐2.17 � 2.81) and care‐as‐usual (‐3.43 � 3.6), with a non‐significant mean difference of 0.903 (‐0.66 to 1.871). CONCLUSION: App‐based treatment is a viable alternative to care‐as‐usual for UI in primary care in terms of effectiveness after one year.

AB  - PURPOSE: Electronic application (app)‐based treatment is promising for common diseases with good conservative management options, such as urinary incontinence (UI) in women, but its effectiveness compared with usual care is unclear. This study set out to determine if app‐based treatment for women with stress, urgency, or mixed UI was noninferior to usual care in the primary care setting. METHODS: The URinControl trial is a pragmatic, noninferiority randomized controlled trial in Dutch primary care including adult women with 2 episodes of UI per week. From July 2015 to July 2018, we screened 350 women for eligibility. A stand‐alone app‐based treatment with pelvic floor muscle and bladder training (URinControl) was compared with usual care according to the Dutch general practitioner guideline for UI treatment. Outcomes measured were change in symptom severity score from baseline to 4 months (primary outcome), impact on disease‐specific quality of life, patient‐perceived improvement, and number of UI episodes. Noninferiority (<1.5 points) was assessed with linear regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 262 eligible women were randomized equally; 195 of them had follow‐up through 4 months. The change in symptom severity with app‐based treatment (‐2.16 points; 95% CI, ‐2.67 to ‐1.65) was noninferior to that with usual care (‐2.56 points; 95% CI, ‐3.28 to ‐1.84), with a mean difference of 0.058 points (95% CI, ‐0.776 to 0.891) between groups. Neither treatment was superior to the other, and both groups showed improvements in outcome measures after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: App‐based treatment for women with UI was at least as effective as usual care in the primary care setting. As such, app‐based treatments, with their potential advantages of privacy, accessibility, and lower cost, may provide women with a good alternative to consultation.

AB  - Background/objectives: Emerging research suggests that face‐to‐face group mindfulness‐based therapies are an effective intervention for insomnia. This pilot study examined the effectiveness of a mindfulness‐based smartphone application for improving objectively‐measured sleep, self‐reported sleep, insomnia severity, pre‐sleep arousal and daytime mood. Method: A community sample of 23 adults with subclinical to moderately severe symptoms of insomnia were randomized to either a mindfulness or progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) smartphone application for 40 or 60 days. Objective sleep outcomes assessed using actigraphy, and self‐report measures of total wake time, cognitive and somatic pre‐sleep arousal, and daytime positive and negative affect were assessed for 14 nights at baseline and post‐intervention. Insomnia severity was recorded at baseline and post‐intervention. Results: A greater reduction in sleep onset latency was observed in the mindfulness group over time, relative to the PMR group. The mindfulness group also reported medium effect size improvements for sleep efficiency. No significant interaction effects were found for self‐reported sleep measures, however, main effects of time were found for both groups for total wake time, insomnia severity, cognitive pre‐sleep arousal, and daytime positive and negative affect. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that both mindfulness and PMR smartphone applications have the potential to improve symptoms of insomnia. In particular, this mindfulness‐based smartphone application may improve sleep onset latency and reduce the duration of night‐awakenings. Further research exploring digital therapeutics as a self‐help option for those with insomnia is needed.

AB  - Introduction: Non‐attendance and medication adherence are longstanding concerns in psychiatric outpatient settings. This study aimed to determine effectiveness of reminders using mobile messaging applications (messaging apps) in improving outpatient attendance and medication adherence among patients with depression. Methods: This was a parallel, open‐label randomised controlled trial with participants recruited from psychiatric outpatient services of a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur and a secondary hospital in Melaka. Adults (?18 years) diagnosed with major depressive disorder; capable of reading and understanding English or Bahasa Malaysia; prescribed with at least one antidepressant and owns a smart phone were subsequently randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment reminders (intervention) or standard treatment without reminders (control), using a computer‐generated randomisation programme. The intervention group received two reminder categories: Outpatient appointment reminders (a day before appointment); and medication reminders (weekly basis). Participants were followed‐up over two months. We utilised Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) to measure the severity of depression; and Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS) to assess medication adherence. Primary outcomes were outpatient attendance rates and medication adherence assessed at two months. Secondary outcomes included changes in depression severity within each group at two months; comparison of changes in depression severity between both groups; preferences of participants towards treatment reminders, and reasons for non‐attendance among participants. This trial was registered with the National Medical Research Registry, NMRR‐19‐3466‐52001. Results: Between February and April 2020, 183 participants were randomised to each group, of whom 179 reached study endpoint (91 [98.9%] of 92 in intervention group and 88 [96.7%] of 91 in control group). All recruited participants (n=183) were analysed using intention‐to‐treat approach. At two months, intervention group has significantly higher outpatient attendance rates (76.8%) than control group (56.4%) (p=0.002), and reported higher medical adherence percentage (mean difference 23.1, [95%CI 0.4, 35.8]; p<0.001). There was also significant difference in the MADRS score change between both groups (mean difference 3.4, [95%CI 0.4, 6.3]; p=0.025). Treatment reminders preferences among participants varied; forgetfulness was the most commonly reported reason (53%) for missing outpatient appointments. Conclusion: Reminders through mobile messaging applications significantly improved outpatient attendance and medication adherence among patients with depression. Our findings support the use of messaging apps for treatment reminders in psychiatric outpatient settings. However, concerns regarding confidentiality require careful measures to be taken.

AB  - Background: Survival rates in cancer are increasing exponentially, with a corresponding increase/influence in disability‐adjusted life‐years. Efforts should be made to explore the optimal balance between unsupervised/distance‐based and supervised/onsite approaches to cancer care. Objective: This study aimed to compare the clinical efficacy of the BENECA mobile Health (mHealth) lifestyle application combined with a supervised rehabilitation program (BENECA and supervised rehabilitation) versus the BENECA mHealth lifestyle application alone on quality of life (QoL) and functional outcomes of breast cancer survivors. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included 80 survivors of breast cancer diagnosed at stage Iâ€“IIIA, who completed adjuvant therapy and were overweight or obese at diagnosis. Participants were randomly allocated (ratio 1:1, 3 waves) to BENECA mHealth and rehabilitation for 2 months (n = 40) or BENECA mHealth and usual care (BENECA mHealth alone; n = 40). Participants completed a questionnaire at baseline (T1), 8‐weeks post‐intervention (T2) and 6‐month follow‐up (T3). The primary outcome was QoL assessed with the EORT QLQ‐C30. Secondary outcomes included upper‐limb functionality and body composition. Statistical (between‐group analyses of covariance) and clinical effects were analyzed by intention to treat. Results: Both groups showed improved outcomes, but global QoL was significantly better with BENECA mHealth and rehabilitation than BENECA mHealth alone (mean difference, 12.76; 95% confidence interval 4.85; 20.67; P = 0.004), with a moderate‐to‐large effect size (d = 72). The proportion of participants reporting reliable clinical improvement on global QoL at T2 was higher with BENECA mHealth and rehabilitation than BENECA mHealth alone (57.5% vs 26.3%, P = 0.008). Improvement in subjective and objective upper‐limb functionality was also higher with BENECA mHealth and rehabilitation. Conclusions: The BENECA mHealth lifestyle application with a supervised rehabilitation program had a statistically and clinically significant effect on QoL and upper‐limb functionality in breast cancer survivors and is a unique and important promising new approach.

AB  - Depressive symptoms are common, yet only a subgroup of individuals receive adequate treatment. To reduce the treatment gap, several online self‐help programs have been developed, yielding small to moderate effects. We developed a smartphone self‐help application addressing depressive symptoms. We sought to evaluate its feasibility and efficacy in participants reporting a subjective need for help (a diagnosis of depression was not mandatory). We conducted a randomized controlled trial (N = 90). The primary outcome was a reduction of depressive symptoms measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9). Secondary outcomes included improved self‐esteem (Rosenberg Self‐Esteem Scale) and quality of life (WHOQOL‐BREF). The intervention group obtained access to the application for four weeks, the wait‐list group received access after the post assessment. No group differences emerged in either outcome in intention‐to‐treat analyses. Per protocol analyses with frequent users (i.e., several times a week or more) yielded a small effect size (η2p = 0.049) at trend level on the reduction of depressive symptoms in favor of the treatment group. However, 39% of the participants did not use the application frequently. Mobile self‐help applications represent a promising addition to existing treatments, but it is important to increase patients' motivation to use them.

AB  - Background: Neurobiological studies suggest that deficits in emotion recognition are common phenomena in alexithymia. Thus, effective treatments for alexithymia often include skills training in the domain of emotion recognition. Given that smartphone‐based interventions (SBIs)offering skills training have been shown to be promising adjuncts to psychological treatments, a blended SBI facilitating the training of emotional skills might be effective in reducing alexithymia. Methods: In this pilot trial, N = 29 individuals reporting elevated alexithymia levels were randomly assigned to a blended SBI including a psychoeducation session and 14 days of training with the mindtastic alexithymia app (MT‐ALEX)or a psychoeducation‐only control condition. Primary outcome was emotion recognition skills as assessed in a computer‐based two‐choice task paradigm. Results: On average, participating in the SBI was associated with a significant increase in computer‐assessed emotion recognition skills compared to the control condition (d = 0.97). Conclusions: Study findings provide preliminary evidence that SBIs can improve emotion recognition skills in alexithymic individuals. Research using larger samples and targeting clinical populations is necessary to further evaluate the potential of MT‐ALEX.

AB  - Background: Given their ubiquity and technological facilities, smartphone‐based interventions (SBIs) hold potential to support the cost‐effective dissemination of evidence‐based treatments for depression. As technologically enriched, blended approach–avoidance modification trainings (AAMTs) have recently been shown effective for symptom reduction in various mental health problems, we developed a blended SBI combining group‐based psychoeducation and 14 days of app training utilizing principles from AAMT to reduce depressive symptoms. Methods: In this pilot trial, N = 16 individuals with heightened depression scores were randomized to either an intervention group using the mentalis Phoenix app or a wait list control condition. As outcomes, we descriptively explored usability of the app, engagement with the intervention, and possible reductions of depressive symptoms. Results: Data analyses suggest that the SBI tested in this pilot trial possesses high usability, is frequently engaged with, and reduces depressive symptoms in participants in the intervention group when compared to wait list controls. Conclusions: This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that an SBI utilizing AAMT can reduce depressive symptoms. Future studies should replicate these findings using larger samples and disentangle possible mechanisms of change. Trial registration: DRKS‐ID: DRKS00021613 (retrospectively registered).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 70% of all deaths in a year globally. The four main NCDs are cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic pulmonary diseases, and diabetes mellitus. Fifty percent of persons with NCD do not adhere to prescribed treatment; in fact, adherence to lifestyle interventions is especially considered as a major challenge. Smartphone apps permit structured monitoring of health parameters, as well as the opportunity to receive feedback. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review and assess the effectiveness of app-based interventions, lasting at least 3 months, to promote lifestyle changes in patients with NCDs. METHODS: In February 2017, a literature search in five databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Academic Research Premier, and Cochrane Reviews and Trials) was conducted. Inclusion criteria was quantitative study designs including randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials that included patients aged 18 years and older diagnosed with any of the four main NCDs. Lifestyle outcomes were physical activity, physical fitness, modification of dietary habits, and quality of life. All included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration`s risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were conducted for one of the outcomes (glycated hemoglobin, HbA1c) by using the estimate of effect of mean post treatment with SD or CI. Heterogeneity was tested using the I2 test. All studies included in the meta-analyses were graded. RESULTS: Of the 1588 records examined, 9 met the predefined criteria. Seven studies included diabetes patients only, one study included heart patients only, and another study included both diabetes and heart patients. Statistical significant effect was shown in HbA1c in 5 of 8 studies, as well in body weight in one of 5 studies and in waist circumference in one of 3 studies evaluating these outcomes. Seven of the included studies were included in the meta-analyses and demonstrated significantly overall effect on HbA1c on a short term (3-6 months; P=.02) with low heterogeneity (I2=41%). In the long term (10-12 months), the overall effect on HbA1c was statistical significant (P=.009) and without heterogeneity (I2=0%). The quality of evidence according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation was low for short term and moderate for long term. CONCLUSIONS: Our review demonstrated limited research of the use of smartphone apps for NCDs other than diabetes with a follow-up of at least 3 months. For diabetes, the use of apps seems to improve lifestyle factors, especially to decrease HbA1c. More research with long-term follow-up should be performed to assess the effect of smartphone apps for NCDs other than diabetes.

AB  - Background: Mobile health interventions, especially smartphone applications (apps), have been proposed as promising interventions for supporting adherence to healthy behaviour in patients post cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The overall aim of the study was to examine the effect of individualized follow‐up with an app for one year on peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) in patients completing CR. Design: The study was designed as a single‐blinded multicentre randomized controlled trial. Methods: The intervention group (IG) received individualized follow‐up enabled with an app for one year, while the control group (CG) received usual care. The primary outcome was difference in VO2peak. Secondary outcomes included exercise performance (time to exhaustion, peak incline (%) and peak velocity (km/h)), bodyweight, resting blood pressure, lipid profile, triglycerides, exercise habits, health‐related quality of life, health status and self‐perceived goal achievement. Results: In total, 113 patients completing CR (73.4% with coronary artery disease, 16.8% after valve surgery and 9.8% with other heart diseases) were randomly allocated to the IG or CG. Intention to treat analyses showed a statistically significant difference in VO2peak between the groups at follow‐up of 2.2 ml/kg/min, 95% confidence interval 0.9â€“3.5 (p < 0.001). Statistically significant differences were also observed in exercise performance, exercise habits and in self‐perceived goal achievement. Conclusions: Individualized follow‐up for one year with an app significantly improved VO2peak, exercise performance and exercise habits, as well as self‐perceived goal achievement, compared with a CG in patients post‐CR. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups at follow‐up in the other outcome measures evaluated.

AB  - Stress is a major health problem in today's workplace. Recent studies suggest that acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is effective for reducing stress at work, specifically among managers. Moreover, smartphone‐delivered treatments have been developed and increasingly used in research. The objective of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of an ACT‐based smartphone treatment among middle managers at medium‐ and large‐sized companies (> 50 employees) in Sweden. A total of 73 participants were randomized to either receive the six‐week stress intervention (n= 36) or to a waitlist control group (n= 37). Results showed small to moderate within‐group effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.37‐0.62) for the treatment group, and small to moderate between group effects (Cohen's d range 0.41‐0.50). In conclusion, the study indicates that a smartphone administered stress intervention based on ACT can reduce perceived stress and increase general health among Swedish middle managers in the private sector.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of two smartphone‐delivered treatments: one based on behavioural activation (BA) and other on mindfulness. DESIGN: Parallel randomised controlled, open, trial. Participants were allocated using an online randomisation tool, handled by an independent person who was separate from the staff conducting the study. SETTING: General community, with recruitment nationally through mass media and advertisements. PARTICIPANTS: 40 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder received a BA treatment, and 41 participants received a mindfulness treatment. 9 participants were lost at the post‐treatment. INTERVENTION BA: An 8‐week long behaviour programme administered via a smartphone application. Mindfulness: An 8‐week long mindfulness programme, administered via a smartphone application. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Beck Depression Inventory‐II (BDI‐II) and the nine‐item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ‐9). RESULTS: 81 participants were randomised (mean age 36.0 years (SD=10.8)) and analysed. Results showed no significant interaction effects of group and time on any of the outcome measures either from pretreatment to post‐treatment or from pretreatment to the 6‐month follow‐up. Subgroup analyses showed that the BA treatment was more effective than the mindfulness treatment among participants with higher initial severity of depression from pretreatment to the 6‐month follow‐up (PHQ‐9: F (1, 362.1)=5.2, p<0.05). In contrast, the mindfulness treatment worked better than the BA treatment among participants with lower initial severity from pretreatment to the 6‐month follow‐up (PHQ‐9: F (1, 69.3)=7.7, p<0.01); BDI‐II: (F(1, 53.60)=6.25, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The two interventions did not differ significantly from one another. For participants with higher severity of depression, the treatment based on BA was superior to the treatment based on mindfulness. For participants with lower initial severity, the treatment based on mindfulness worked significantly better than the treatment based on BA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials NCT01463020.

AB  - Fully automated self‐help interventions can serve as highly cost‐effective mental health promotion tools for massive amounts of people. However, these interventions are often characterised by poor adherence. One way to address this problem is to mimic therapy support by a conversational agent. The objectives of this study were to assess the effectiveness and adherence of a smartphone app, delivering strategies used in positive psychology and CBT interventions via an automated chatbot (Shim) for a non‐clinical population — as well as to explore participants' views and experiences of interacting with this chatbot. A total of 28 participants were randomized to either receive the chatbot intervention (n = 14) or to a wait‐list control group (n = 14). Findings revealed that participants who adhered to the intervention (n = 13) showed significant interaction effects of group and time on psychological well‐being (FS) and perceived stress (PSS‐10) compared to the wait‐list control group, with small to large between effect sizes (Cohen's d range 0.14–1.06). Also, the participants showed high engagement during the 2‐week long intervention, with an average open app ratio of 17.71 times for the whole period. This is higher compared to other studies on fully automated interventions claiming to be highly engaging, such as Woebot and the Panoply app. The qualitative data revealed sub‐themes which, to our knowledge, have not been found previously, such as the moderating format of the chatbot. The results of this study, in particular the good adherence rate, validated the usefulness of replicating this study in the future with a larger sample size and an active control group. This is important, as the search for fully automated, yet highly engaging and effective digital self‐help interventions for promoting mental health is crucial for the public health.

AB  - Excessive alcohol consumption is a top contributor to global burden of disease and costs billions of dollars every year in the United States. While many people engage in excessive alcohol use, few receive or complete effective treatment. To help people receive treatment many smartphone apps targeting alcohol use have been created. However, the majority of these have not been empirically studied. This study aimed to add to the literature by investigating whether a smartphone app to reduce drinking was more effective than a one-time web-based assessment and feedback control condition. For this study, participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and the University of Alaska (UA) system. Those randomized to the smartphone app were required to download the app and to register for the intervention to be considered actively enrolled in the study. Participants (N = 23) completed a battery of alcohol assessment measures on Qualtrics at baseline and at a 6-week follow up. Those recruited from MTurk earned a total of $4.90 for completing all phases of the study and university student participants could earn a total of $15 for completing all phases of the study. Retention rates differed significantly between the two recruitment platforms. Of those who consented to participate, 18% of MTurk participants and 41.6% of university student participants completed all phases of the study. Outcomes did not differ significantly between the two intervention groups on measures of alcohol consumption or alcohol related problems. However, due to high attrition and the resulting small sample size, all analyses were underpowered. Thus, future studies with adequate sample sizes are needed to compare these interventions. However, important lessons were learned regarding the limitations of MTurk to recruit and retain participants for longitudinal alcohol intervention studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anger is a symptom of post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) associated with a range of clinical and functional impairments, and may be especially prevalent among veterans with PTSD. Effective anger management therapies exist but may be undermined by poor engagement or lack of treatment availability. Finding ways to engage veterans in anger management therapy or to improve access can be helpful in improving clinical outcomes. This randomized controlled trial compared anger management treatment (AMT) with AMT augmented by a mobile application (app) system, Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management (RELAX). METHODS: Participants were 58 veterans enrolled in 12 sessions of either AMT alone or AMT with the RELAX system (AMT + RELAX). The RELAX system includes the RELAX app, a wearable heart rate monitor, a remote server, and a web‐based therapist interface. RELAX allows the user to practice skills, monitor symptoms, and record physiological data. The server collects data on app use. A web‐based interface allows the therapist to access data on between‐session practice, and skills use. Measures administered at baseline, post‐treatment, and 3‐and 6‐month follow‐up include state and trait anger, dimensions of anger, PTSD, depression, interpersonal functioning, and satisfaction. We used multilevel modeling to account for the nesting of time points within participants and participants within treatment groups. Predictors were Treatment Condition (AMT + RELAX and AMT), Linear Time (baseline, post‐treatment, 3‐and 6‐month follow‐up), and Quadratic Time and Treatment Condition × Linear Time interaction. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (Armonk, New York). Approval was obtained from the institutional review board. RESULTS: Across groups, the treatment dropout rate was 13.8%; of those who remained in treatment, 90% received an adequate dose of treatment (10 or more sessions). There were no significant differences between groups on attendance or treatment completion. Participants in both treatments demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in anger severity and significant post‐treatment reductions in PTSD. Veterans did not report significant changes in depression or interpersonal functioning. Veterans in the AMT + RELAX group reported spending significantly less time on homework assignments, and they rated the AMT + RELAX app as helpful and easy to use, with these ratings improving over time. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that AMT + RELAX was beneficial in reducing anger symptoms and promoting efficient use of the between‐session practice; however, AMT + RELAX did not outperform AMT. This study is an important contribution as it is one of the first randomized controlled trials to study the efficacy of a technology‐enhanced, evidence‐based psychotherapy for anger management. Findings are limited because of small sample size and modifications to the technology during the trial. However, the results highlight the possible benefits of mobile app‐supported treatment, including increasing the accessibility of treatment, lowering therapist workload, reducing costs of treatment, reducing practice time, and enabling new activities and types of treatments. This study presents preliminary evidence that mobile apps can be a valuable addition to treatment for patients with anger difficulties. Future research should evaluate how much therapist involvement is needed to support anger management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of mobile health (mHealth) apps exist that focus specifically on promoting exercise behavior. To increase user engagement, prompts, such as text messages, emails, or push notifications, are often used. To date, little research has been done to understand whether, and for how long, these prompts influence exercise behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of prompts on mHealth self‐monitoring and self‐reported exercise in the days following a prompt and whether these effects differ based on exercise modality. METHODS: Of the possible 99 adults at risk for developing type II diabetes who participated in a diabetes prevention program, 69 were included in this secondary analysis. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of the following 2 exercise conditions: high‐intensity interval training or moderate‐intensity continuous training. In the year following a brief, community‐based diabetes prevention program involving counseling and supervised exercise sessions, all participants self‐monitored their daily exercise behaviors on an mHealth app in which they were sent personalized prompts at varying frequencies. mHealth self‐monitoring and self‐reported exercise data from the app were averaged over 1, 3, 5, and 7 days preceding and following a prompt and subsequently compared using t tests. RESULTS: In the year following the diabetes prevention program, self‐monitoring (t68=6.82; P<.001; d=0.46) and self‐reported exercise (t68=2.16; P=.03; d=0.38) significantly increased in the 3 days following a prompt compared with the 3 days preceding. Prompts were most effective in the first half of the year, and there were no differences in self‐monitoring or self‐reported exercise behaviors between exercise modalities (P values >.05). In the first half of the year, self‐monitoring was significant in the 3 days following a prompt (t68=8.61; P<.001; d=0.60), and self‐reported exercise was significant in the 3 days (t68=3.7; P<.001; d=0.37), 5 days (t67=2.15; P=.04; d=0.14), and 7 days (t68=2.46; P=.02; d=0.15) following a prompt, whereas no significant changes were found in the second half of the year. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence regarding the potential influence of prompts on mHealth self‐monitoring and self‐reported exercise and the duration for which prompts may be effective as exercise behavior change tools. Future studies should determine the optimal prompting frequency for influencing self‐reported exercise behaviors. Optimizing prompt frequency can potentially reduce intervention costs and promote user engagement. Furthermore, it can encourage consumers to self‐monitor using mHealth technology while ensuring prompts are sent when necessary and effective.

AB  - Background: Sleep hygiene is important for maintaining good sleep and reducing insomnia. Objective: This study examined the long‐term efficacy of a theory‐based app (including cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], theory of planned behavior [TPB], health action process approach [HAPA], and control theory [CT]) on sleep hygiene among insomnia patients. Methods: The study was a 2‐arm single‐blind parallel‐group randomized controlled trial (RCT). Insomnia patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group that used an app for 6 weeks (ie, CBT for insomnia [CBT‐I], n=156) or a control group that received only patient education (PE, n=156) through the app. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postintervention. Primary outcomes were sleep hygiene, insomnia, and sleep quality. Secondary outcomes included attitudes toward sleep hygiene behavior, perceived behavioral control, behavioral intention, action and coping planning, self‐monitoring, behavioral automaticity, and anxiety and depression. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the magnitude of changes in outcomes between the two groups and across time. Results: Sleep hygiene was improved in the CBT‐I group compared with the PE group (P=.02 at 1 month, P=.04 at 3 months, and P=.02 at 6 months) as were sleep quality and severity of insomnia. Mediation analyses suggested that perceived behavioral control on sleep hygiene as specified by TPB along with self‐regulatory processes from HAPA and CT mediated the effect of the intervention on outcomes. Conclusions: Health care providers might consider using a CBT‐I app to improve sleep among insomnia patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based interventions, self-compassion training, and cognitive behavioral therapy have garnered much evidence in its salutary effects on mental health. With increasing application of smartphone and mobile technology on health promotion, this study investigated the efficacy and possible moderators of mindfulness, self-compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation training mobile apps in the improvement of mental health. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of 3 mobile app-based programs: mindfulness-based program, self-compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation program in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. Changes in mindful awareness and self-compassion were also assessed. To further delineate the suitability of each program for different types of individuals, individual difference variables (ie, discomfort with emotions and tolerance for ambiguity) were explored for potential moderation. METHODS: This study was a 3-arm, randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial examining the efficacy of mindfulness-based program, self-compassion program, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation. Participants were randomized into either 1 of the 3 conditions. Throughout the 4-week, 28-session program, participants spent 10-15 min daily reviewing the course content and practicing various related exercises. At preprogram, postprogram, and 3-month follow-up, participants also completed Web-based measures of mental well-being, psychological distress, mindful-awareness, and self-compassion as well as the proposed moderators. RESULTS: Among the 2161 study participants, 508 and 349 completed the post- and 3-month follow-up assessment, respectively. All 3 conditions (mindfulness-based program: N=703; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation: N=753; self-compassion program: N=705) were found to be efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress. All conditions enhanced mindful awareness at postprogram. Significant interaction effect was found on self-compassion; cognitive behavioral psychoeducation and self-compassion program, but not mindfulness-based program, significantly enhanced self-compassion at postprogram. No significant differences regarding usage and users' satisfaction were found among the 3 conditions. None of the proposed moderators were found to be significant. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based, self-compassion, and cognitive behavioral psychoeducation mobile apps were efficacious in improving mental well-being and reducing psychological distress among adults at postprogram and 3-month follow-up. Future app-based psychological training programs should consider gamification and personalization of content or feedback to enhance engagement and mitigate the high attrition rates that are common in app-based health promotion programs.

AB  - Background: According to the expansion of suicide prevention applications in recent years, the aim of this study was to review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pretest-posttest studies that evaluated the effectiveness of suicide prevention applications. Methods: In this systematic review, we searched online databases including Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Chocrane Database, and Google Scholar to find randomized controlled trials and pretest-posttest studies published up to Jul 18, 2019. Randomized controlled trials and pretest-posttest of efficacy self-guided telephone applications that reported any primary and secondary outcome of suicidal thoughts and behaviors were included in the review. We evaluated the articles using the CONSORT 2010 checklist. Results: After screening articles, 7 studies were included in this review. Four studies focused on the effectiveness of applications on suicide thoughts and attempt, 2 on effectiveness of applications on self-injury, 4 on depression and anxiety, 1 on impulsivity, and 2 on adaptive strategies. Overall, mobile phone applications were associated with reductions in suicidal ideation scores at post intervention, and enhancement of adaptive skills; however, no evidence of reduction was reported in impulsivity after use of applications. Conclusion: Despite the differences in studies, this review showed that the use of mobile applications had an overall positive effect on reducing the risk of suicide and improving performance and health of patients.

AB  - Background: Sedentary behavior (SB) and lack of physical activity (PA) have been associated with poorer health outcomes and are increasingly prevalent in individuals working in sedentary occupations such as office jobs. Gamification and nudges have attracted attention as promising strategies to promote changes in health behavior. However, most effectiveness studies thus far lacked active controls, and few studies have tested interventions combining these strategies. Objective: This study investigates the effectiveness of combining a gamified digital app with physical nudges to increase PA and reduce SB in Dutch office workers. Methods: Employees in the municipality of Rotterdam (N=298) from two office locations were randomized at the location level to either a 10‐week intervention, combining a 5‐week gamification phase encompassing a gamified digital app with social support features and a 5‐week physical nudges phase, or to an active control (ie, basic digital app with self‐monitoring and goal setting). The primary outcome was the daily step count, objectively measured via accelerometers. Secondary outcomes were self‐reported PA and SB measured at baseline and at 5, 10, and 14 weeks. Mixed effects models were used to analyze the effects of the intervention on the outcome measures. Results: A total of 78.5% (234/298) of participants completed the study and provided accelerometer data, whereas 36.9% (110/298) participants completed the self‐report measures at 14 weeks. In the gamification phase, step count data were missing for 13.5% (473/3492) of observations in the control and 11.4% (445/3888) in the intervention condition; however, these percentages increased to 39.6% (1154/2910) and 59.6% (1932/3492) at follow‐up, respectively. During the gamification phase, intervention participants increased their number of daily steps by 634 (95% CI 154.2‐1113.8; P=.01) more than participants in the control group, after controlling for relevant factors. Improvements were not sustained during the physical nudges phase (P=.76) or follow‐up (P=.88). Conclusions: A digital intervention with gamification and social support features significantly increased the step count of office workers compared with an active control. Physical nudges in the workplace were insufficient to promote the maintenance of behavioral changes achieved in the gamification phase. Future research should explore the long‐term effectiveness of similar gamified digital interventions.

AB  - A wide range of chronic diseases could be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices, such as consuming five portions of fruits and vegetables daily, although the majority of the adult population does not meet this recommendation. The use of mobile phone applications for health purposes has greatly increased; these applications guide users in real time through various phases of behavioural change. This review aimed to assess the potential of self-monitoring mobile phone health (mHealth) applications to increase fruit and vegetable intake. PubMed and Web of Science were used to conduct this systematized review, and the inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trials evaluating mobile phone applications focused on increasing fruit and/or vegetable intake as a primary or secondary outcome performed from 2008 to 2018. Eight studies were included in the final assessment. The interventions described in six of these studies were effective in increasing fruit and/or vegetable intake. Targeting stratified populations and using long-lasting interventions were identified as key aspects that could influence the effectiveness of these interventions. In conclusion, evidence shows the effectiveness of mHealth application interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption. Further research is needed to design effective interventions and to determine their efficacy over the long term.

AB  - Introduction: With the epidemic of obesity numerous mobile health (mHealth) applications have been designed with the goal of facilitating weight loss. This technology has the potential to focus behavioral modification in a manner that's effective for weight loss. We examined the use of this mHealth technology in our bariatric surgery population to evaluate effects on weight loss following surgery. Methods: Single institution prospective randomized control trial performed at an academic center. 56 patients who recently underwent a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) were enrolled into a control group with standard post‐operative monitoring and a mHealth application group provided with iPad© minis with the MyFitnessPal© mHealth application. Participants were followed for 24 months. The primary outcomes were effect on weight loss as determined by excess body weight loss (%EWL) and excess BMI loss (%EBL). Results: Statistically significant differences in weight loss outcomes between the groups were present throughout the duration of the study. At 12 months, %EWL was 74.41% (control) vs 81.41% (mHealth) p value 0.047 and at 24 months, it was 59.10% (control) vs 71.47% (mHealth) p value 0.0078. %EBL findings at 12 months was 28.02% (control) vs 32.15% (mHealth) p value 0.0007 and at 24 months, it was 25.39% (control) vs 27.87% (mHealth) p value 0.048. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate mHealth applications are a useful adjunct to improve and maintain weight loss following bariatric surgery. We suggest mHealth applications should be utilized following bariatric surgery for improved outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Mobile applications (apps) may improve adherence and disease state‐related outcomes in patients with uncontrolled chronic diseases, including hypertension. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using a pharmacist‐designed app to improve blood pressure (BP) and promote adherence to antihypertensive medications. Methods: This study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. Patients were randomized to an intervention or control group for 3 months. The intervention was a pharmacist‐designed mobile app. Antihypertensive medication refill history was assessed 3 months before, during study, and 3 months after study completion. Continuous outcome measures investigated were systolic/diastolic BP and medication refill history using the cumulative medication gap (CMG). Statistical analysis comparing median difference in BPs and CMGs between groups was conducted using Theil‐Sen Siegel regression. Results: The propensity score adjusted population consisted of 78 patients (n = 39 for both groups). No significant difference was observed in the conditional median difference in CMG between groups at the 3‐month follow‐up visit (−0.06 [P =.70]). No significant difference was observed in the conditional median difference in systolic and diastolic BP between groups at the 3‐month follow‐up visit (−2.00 [P =.07] and −1.00 mmHg [P =.39] systolic and diastolic, respectively). Upon subgroup analysis, those nonadherent at baseline in the intention to treat population experienced a significant improvement in outcomes (−0.06 P =.03] and −12.00 mmHg [P =.002] CMG and systolic BP, respectively). Conclusion: A pharmacist‐designed mobile app did not result in improved medication adherence or BP control, but may be beneficial in patients with hypertension who struggle with medication adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of major depression, antidepressants are effective but not curative. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also effective, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, but accessibility is a problem. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT app as adjunctive therapy among patients with antidepressant‐resistant major depression. METHODS: A multisite, assessor‐masked, parallel‐group randomized controlled trial was conducted in 20 psychiatric clinics and hospitals in Japan. Participants were eligible if they had a primary diagnosis of major depression and were antidepressant‐refractory after taking one or more antidepressants at an adequate dosage for four or more weeks. After a 1‐week run‐in in which participants started the medication switch and had access to the welcome session of the app, patients were randomized to medication switch alone or to medication switch plus smartphone CBT app via the centralized Web system. The smartphone app, called Kokoro‐app ("kokoro" means "mind" in Japanese), included sessions on self‐monitoring, behavioral activation, and cognitive restructuring presented by cartoon characters. The primary outcome was depression severity as assessed by masked telephone assessors with the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) at week 9. The secondary outcomes included the Beck Depression Inventory‐II (BDI‐II) and Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Ratings (FIBSER). RESULTS: In the total sample (N=164), 81 participants were allocated to the smartphone CBT in addition to medication change and 83 to medication change alone. In the former group, all but one participant (80/81, 99%) completed at least half, and 71 (88%) completed at least six of eight sessions. In the intention‐to‐treat analysis, patients allocated the CBT app scored 2.48 points (95% CI 1.23‐3.72, P<.001; standardized mean difference 0.40) lower on PHQ‐9 than the control at week 9. The former group also scored 4.1 points (95% CI 1.5‐6.6, P=.002) lower on BDI‐II and 0.76 points (95% CI ‐0.05 to 1.58, P=.07) lower on FIBSER. In the per‐protocol sample (comfortable with the smartphone app, still symptomatic, and adherent to medication with mild or less side effects after run‐in), the intervention group (n=60) scored 1.72 points (95% CI 0.25‐3.18, P=.02) lower on PHQ‐9, 3.2 points (95% CI ‐0.01 to 6.3, P=.05) lower on BDI‐II, and 0.75 points (95% CI 0.03‐1.47, P=.04) lower on FIBSER than the control (n=57). The treatment benefits were maintained up to week 17. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of a smartphone CBT in the treatment of clinically diagnosed depression. Given the merits of the mobile mental health intervention, including accessibility, affordability, quality control, and effectiveness, it is clinically worthwhile to consider adjunctive use of a smartphone CBT app when treating patients with antidepressant‐resistant depression. Research into its effectiveness in wider clinical contexts is warranted.

AB  - - Background Asthma is one of the most common long‐term conditions worldwide, which places considerable pressure on patients, communities and health systems. The major international clinical guidelines now recommend the inclusion of self management programmes in the routine management of patients with asthma. These programmes have been associated with improved outcomes in patients with asthma. However, the implementation of self management programmes in clinical practice, and their uptake by patients, is still poor. Recent developments in mobile technology, such as smartphone and tablet computer apps, could help develop a platform for the delivery of self management interventions that are highly customisable, low‐cost and easily accessible. Objectives To assess the effectiveness, cost‐effectiveness and feasibility of using smartphone and tablet apps to facilitate the self management of individuals with asthma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register (CAGR), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Health Library, Compendex/Inspec/Referex, IEEEXplore, ACM Digital Library, CiteSeer x and CAB abstracts via Web of Knowledge. We also searched registers of current and ongoing trials and the grey literature. We checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review articles for additional references. We searched for studies published from 2000 onwards. The latest search was run in June 2013. Selection criteria We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared self management interventions for patients with clinician‐diagnosed asthma delivered via smartphone apps to self management interventions delivered via traditional methods (e.g. paper‐based asthma diaries). Data collection and analysis We used standard methods expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcomes were symptom scores; frequency of healthcare visits due to asthma exacerbations or complications and health‐related quality of life. Main results We included two RCTs with a total of 408 participants. We found no cluster RCTs, controlled before and after studies or interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. Both RCTs evaluated the effect of a mobile phone‐based asthma self management intervention on asthma control by comparing it to traditional, paper‐based asthma self management. One study allowed participants to keep daily entries of their asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, peak flow readings and peak flow variability on their mobile phone, from which their level of asthma control was calculated remotely and displayed together with the corresponding asthma self management recommendations. In the other study, participants recorded the same readings twice daily, and they received immediate self management feedback in the form of a three‐colour traffic light display on their phones. Participants falling into the amber zone of their action plan twice, or into the red zone once, received a phone call from an asthma nurse who enquired about the reasons for their uncontrolled asthma. We did not conduct a meta‐analysis of the data extracted due to the considerable degree of heterogeneity between these studies. Instead we adopted a narrative synthesis approach. Overall, the results were inconclusive and we judged the evidence to have a GRADE rating of low quality because further evidence is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. In addition, there was not enough information in one of the included studies to assess the risk of bias for the majority of the domains. Although the other included study was methodologically rigorous, it was not possible to blind participants or personnel in the study. Moreover, there are concerns in both studies in relation to attrition bias and other sources of bias. One study showed that the use of a smartphone app for the delivery of an asthma self m nagement programme had no statistically significant effect on asthma symptom scores (mean difference (MD) 0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐0.23 to 0.25), asthma‐related quality of life (MD of mean scores 0.02, 95% CI ‐0.35 to 0.39), unscheduled visits to the emergency department (OR 7.20, 95% CI 0.37 to 140.76) or frequency of hospital admissions (odds ratio (OR) 3.07, 95% CI 0.32 to 29.83). The other included study found that the use of a smartphone app resulted in higher asthma‐related quality of life scores at six‐month follow‐up (MD 5.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 9.52 for the physical component score of the SF‐12 questionnaire; MD 6.00, 95% CI 2.51 to 9.49 for the mental component score of the SF‐12 questionnaire), improved lung function (PEFR) at four (MD 27.80, 95% CI 4.51 to 51.09), five (MD 31.40, 95% CI 8.51 to 54.29) and six months (MD 39.20, 95% CI 16.58 to 61.82), and reduced visits to the emergency department due to asthma‐related complications (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.99). Both studies failed to find any statistical differences in terms of adherence to the intervention and occurrence of other asthma‐related complications. Authors' conclusions The current evidence base is not sufficient to advise clinical practitioners, policy‐makers and the general public with regards to the use of smartphone and tablet computer apps for the delivery of asthma self management programmes. In order to understand the efficacy of apps as standalone interventions, future research should attempt to minimise the differential clinical management of patients between control and intervention groups. Those studies evaluating apps as part of complex, multicomponent interventions, should attempt to tease out the relative contribution of each intervention component. Consideration of the theoretical constructs used to inform the development of the intervention would help to achieve this goal. Finally, researchers should also take into account: the role of ancillary components in moderating the observed effects, the seasonal nature of asthma and long‐term adherence to self management practices. Plain language summary Can smartphone apps improve access to asthma self management? Background Self management programmes have been advocated as a means to help people with asthma achieve better levels of asthma control and better asthma‐related outcomes. However, there are a number of barriers affecting the successful implementation and uptake of these programmes. These barriers call for innovative approaches for the delivery of self management programmes. Of particular interest is the use of consumer devices such as smartphones and tablet computers as a means of delivering these programmes within the existing healthcare configuration. Review question This review assessed whether smartphone and tablet computer apps are effective tools for supporting patients with asthma to self manage their own condition. Description of the studies We included two studies with a total of 408 participants. Both studies evaluated the effect of a mobile phone‐based asthma self management intervention on asthma control by comparing it to traditional, paper‐based asthma self management. One study allowed participants to keep daily entries of their asthma symptoms, asthma medication usage, peak flow readings and peak flow variability on their mobile phone, from which their level of asthma control was calculated remotely and displayed together with the corresponding asthma self management recommendations. In the other study, participants recorded the same readings twice daily, and they received immediate self management feedback in the form of a three‐colour traffic light display on their phones. Participants falling into the amber zone of their action plan twice, or into the red zone once, received a phone call from an asthma nurse who enquired about the reasons for their uncontrolled asthma. Key results Due to the lack of enough included studies and the considerable differences between them, we were unable to obtain conclusive answers to our esearch question. One study showed that the use of a smartphone app can result in better asthma‐related quality of life and lung function, and reduced visits to the emergency department. The other study failed to show any significant improvements in asthma‐related outcomes after using a smartphone app as a delivery mechanism. Quality of the evidence The current evidence base is not sufficient to advise clinicians, policy‐makers and the general public with regards to the effectiveness of smartphone and tablet computer apps for the delivery of asthma self management programmes. This plain language summary is current as of June 2013.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphones with the aim of increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and providing scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, which are considered the gold standard for the treatment of most mental health problems. OBJECTIVE: This review investigates standalone smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) built on principles derived from CBT that aim to improve mental health. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2020. We included studies focusing on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, for example, app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, that is, choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in the primary outcomes used in the studies. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (mean 70.8%, SD 15.3; n=4 studies) and satisfying for users (mean 72.6%, SD 17.2; n=7 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily lives. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable, and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.

AB  - Introduction: Digital interventions, such as smartphone applications (apps), are becoming an increasingly common way to support medication adherence and self‐management in chronic illness.Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in pharmacological therapeutic adherence in mild to moderate arterial hypertension (AHT), through an app installed on a mobile phone, as well as the degree of control reached by the patient with this tool.Methods: Prospective, randomized controlled trial, full study and multicenter study. Four primary care centers participated. One hundred and fifty‐four hypertensive patients under antihypertensive treatment were included. Two groups were established: a control group (CG) with usual intervention (n = 77) and an intervention group (n = 77) (IG), targeting hypertensive people who owned and regularly used a mobile smartphone, specifically using the app called AlerHTA to promote health education and reminder of appointments. There were three visits: initial, 6 and 12 months. Drug adherence was measured by electronic monitors (MEMSs). The primary outcomes were average daily percentage adherence between 80 and 100%, and AHT control.Results: A total of 148 patients finished the study. Mean age was 57.5 ± 9.9. Global adherence was 77.02% (CI = 70.25‐83.79) and daily adherence was 74.32% (CI = 67.29‐81.35%). Daily adherence was 93.15% and 86.3% in IG, and 70.66% and 62.66% in CG after 6 and 12 months respectively (p < .05). The percentage of uncontrolled patients was 28.3% (CI = 21.05‐35.55%). The control of high blood pressure at 12 months was 17.8% and 38.6% for IG and CG respectively (p < .05). The number of patients needed to treat to avoid non‐adherence (NNT) was 4.23 patients.Conclusions: The intervention with an app installed on the mobile phones of hypertensive patients favors pharmacological therapeutic adherence and improves the percentage of hypertensive patient control.Trial registration: Spanish Agency of Medicine: EPA‐SP UN‐HTA‐2015‐01.

AB  - Objective Test the efficacy of SmartLossSM, a smartphone‐based weight loss intervention, in a pilot study. Design and Methods A 12‐week randomized controlled trial. Adults (25‐<‐BMI‐<‐35 kg/m2) were randomized to SmartLoss (n‐=‐20) or an attention‐matched Health Education control group (n‐=‐20). SmartLoss participants were prescribed a 1,200 to 1,400 kcal/d diet and were provided with a smartphone, body weight scale, and accelerometer that wirelessly transmitted body weight and step data to a website. In the SmartLoss Group, mathematical models were used to quantify dietary adherence based on body weight and counselors remotely delivered treatment recommendations based on these objective data. The Health Education group received health tips via smartphone. A mixed model determined if change in weight and other endpoints differed between the groups (baseline was a covariate). Results The sample was 82.5% female. Mean‐+/‐‐SD baseline age, weight (kg), and BMI were 44.4‐+/‐‐11.8 years, 80.3‐+/‐‐11.5 kg, and 29.8‐+/‐‐2.9 kg/m2, respectively. One participant was lost to follow‐up in each group before week 4. Weight loss was significantly (P‐<‐0.001) larger in the SmartLoss (least squares mean‐+/‐‐SEM: ‐9.4‐+/‐‐0.5%) compared with the Health Education group (‐0.6‐+/‐‐0.5%). Conclusions SmartLoss efficaciously promote clinically meaningful weight loss compared with an attention‐matched control group. Smartphone‐based interventions might prove useful in intervention dissemination.

AB  - The objectives of this systematic review were to analyse existing evidence on the efficacy of smartphone devices in promoting physical activity (PA) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to identify the validity and precision of their measurements. A systematic review was undertaken across nine electronic databases: WOS Core Collection, PubMed, CINAHL, AMED, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SciELO, LILACS and ScienceDirect. Randomized and non-randomized controlled clinical trials were identified. To obtain additional eligible articles, the reference lists of the selected studies were also checked. Eligibility criteria and risk of bias were assessed by two independent authors. A total of eight articles met eligibility criteria. The studies were focused on promoting PA (n = 5) and the precision of device measurements (n = 3). The effectiveness of smartphones in increasing PA level (steps/day) at short and long term is very limited. Mobile-based exercise programs reported improvements in exercise capacity (i.e. incremental Shuttle-Walk-Test) at short and long term (18.3% and 21%, respectively). The precision of device measurements was good-to-excellent (r = 0.69-0.99); however, these data should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations of studies. The effectiveness of smartphone devices in promoting PA levels in patients with COPD is scarce. Further high-quality studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of smartphone devices in promoting PA levels. Registration number: CRD42016050048.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic endocrine-metabolic disease, the evolution of which is closely related to people´s self-control of glycemic levels through nutrition, exercise, and medicines. AIM: To determine whether smartphone apps can help persons with diabetes to improve their % levels of glycosylated hemoglobin. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis were done. ProQuest, Pubmed/Medline, and Scopus databases were used. The search equation used was "(Prevention and Control) AND Diabetes Mellitus AND Smartphones". The inclusion criteria applied were clinical trials, conducted in 2014-2019. RESULTS: n = 18 studies were included in the review. The studies tried different applications to monitor glycemia and support patients to improve glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. More than half of the studies found statistically significant differences in HbA1c in the intervention group compared with the control group. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis and the study sample was n = 545 for the experimental group and n = 454 for the control group. The meta-analytic estimation of the HbA1c % level means differences between intervention and control group was statistically significant in favour of the intervention group with a mean difference of -0.37 (-0.58, -0.15. 95% confidence interval). CONCLUSION: Smartphone apps can help people with diabetes to improve their level of HbA1c, but the clinical impact is low.

AB  - Although many university women are highly concerned and distressed about their eating and weight, relatively few seek traditional treatment for these problems. Smartphone applications ("apps") are a potentially useful way to disseminate evidence-based intervention strategies to this population. Yet, little research has assessed the effectiveness and acceptability of apps targeting eating behavior. The present study evaluates an app, called the Mindful Eating Coach, that emphasizes appetite monitoring (i.e., self-monitoring of appetite cues) and additional strategies to promote mindful eating. Ninety-four female students (ages 18-30) were recruited for a study described as testing an iPhone app that teaches mindful eating strategies. Participants were randomly assigned to the App group (n = 44) or to a Waitlist control group (n = 50). Dropout was very low and high levels of compliance were found for the core self-monitoring tools of the app, with a substantial number using these features daily. Participants rated the app as very easy to use and as not taking too much time to use. On average, participants rated the app as helpful and preferred over food monitoring as well as over seeking traditional counseling. After 3 weeks of use, all participants were reassessed and those in the App group reported significantly greater improvements in mindful eating, appetite awareness, and general mindfulness than the Waitlist group. Results suggested that the app was somewhat more helpful for women with initially lower levels of general mindfulness. The app did not lead to significantly greater improvement than a waitlist on measures assessing broader eating problems not directly targeted by the app. However, within the App group, improvements in mindful eating and appetite awareness were correlated with reductions on the broader eating measures. The results of this initial evaluation of the Mindful Eating Coach are promising and provide preliminary support for a mindful eating app as a viable alternative for women who are not seeking traditional treatment, and perhaps as an early step in a stepped care treatment model. Continued investigation of the potential for apps to increase access to effective treatment strategies for individuals with disordered eating or related problems seems warranted.

AB  - Evidence of the long‐term efficacy of digital therapies for smoking cessation that include a smartphone application (app) is limited. In this multi‐center randomized controlled trial, we tested the efficacy of a novel digital therapy for smoking cessation: the â€œCureApp Smoking Cessation (CASC)â€� system, including a CASC smartphone app, a web‐based patient management PC software for primary physicians, and a mobile exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) checker. A total of 584 participants with nicotine dependence were recruited from October 2017 to January 2018, and allocated 1:1 to the CASC intervention group or the control group. Both groups received a standard smoking cessation treatment with pharmacotherapy and counseling for 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the intervention group used the CASC system, and the control group used a control‐app without a mobile CO checker, each for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the biochemically validated continuous abstinence rate (CAR) from weeks 9 to 24. The main secondary outcome was an extended CAR from weeks 9 to 52. Except for 12 participants who did not download or use the apps, 285 participants were assigned to the intervention group, and 287, to the control. CAR from weeks 9 to 24 in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (63.9% vs. 50.5%; odds ratio [OR], 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 2.42; P = 0.001). The CAR from weeks 9 to 52 was also higher in the intervention group than that in the control group (52.3% vs. 41.5%; OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.16; P = 0.010). No specific adverse events caused by the CASC system were reported. Augmenting standard face‐to‐face counseling and pharmacotherapy with a novel smartphone app, the CASC system significantly improved long‐term CARs compared to standard treatment and a minimally supportive control app.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women significantly decrease their activity levels in the transition to motherhood. Digital health technologies are low cost, scalable, and can provide an effective delivery mechanism for behavior change. This is the first study that examines the use of videoconferencing and mobile apps to create exercise groups for mothers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of an individually adaptive and socially supportive physical activity intervention incorporating videoconferencing and mobile apps for mothers. METHODS: The Moms Online Video Exercise Study was an 8‐week, 2‐armed, Web‐based randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of a group exercise intervention with a waitlist control. Healthy mothers with at least 1 child under the age of 12 years were recruited through Facebook and email listservs. Intervention participants joined exercise groups using videoconferencing (Google Hangouts) every morning on weekdays and exercised together in real time, guided by exercise mobile apps (eg, Nike+, Sworkit) of their choice. Waitlist control participants had access to recommended mobile apps and an invitation to join an exercise group after the 8‐week study period. Main outcomes assessed included changes in self‐reported moderate, vigorous, and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes per week in aggregate and stratified by whether women met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for sufficient aerobic activity at baseline. Outcomes were measured through self‐assessed Web‐based questionnaires at baseline and 8 weeks. RESULTS: The intervention was effective at increasing exercise for inactive women and proved to be feasible and acceptable to all participants. A total of 64 women were randomized, 30 to intervention and 34 to control. Women attended 2.8 sessions per week. There was a strong, but not statistically significant, trend toward increasing moderate, vigorous, and MVPA minutes for all women. As hypothesized, in the prespecified stratum of women who were inactive at baseline (n=51), intervention participants significantly increased their activity by an average of 50 (95% CI 4.0‐95.9, P=.03) MVPA minutes per week more than control participants. They had a corresponding statistically significant net increase of 19 (95% CI 3.2‐34.8, P=.02) minutes of vigorous activity. Inactive women in the intervention arm also experienced promising reductions in depression, reporting a statistically significant net decrease in their depression score (‐3.8, 95% CI ‐7.0 to ‐0.6; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: We found that a group exercise intervention using videoconferencing and mobile apps was a feasible and acceptable way to deliver a physical activity intervention to mothers. The intervention increased physical activity in inactive mothers. Further studies are needed to better establish how long these changes in physical activity can be maintained and whether these findings can be reproduced in a more diverse population.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic pain creates economic burden and exerts profound individual and societal harm. Mobile application (app)-delivered mindfulness meditation may be an important approach to self-management of chronic pain. Objectives: We examined the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of app-delivered mindfulness meditation on pain cognition and daily functioning among patients reporting chronic pain. Methods: We used a longitudinal, randomized, and wait-list-controlled design (NCT03495726) to evaluate changes in self-reported pain severity, pain catastrophizing, and social and physical functioning among participants randomized to 6 weeks of app-delivered mindfulness meditation, compared with participants randomized to a wait-list control group. Results: Although most participants randomized to the mindfulness group used the app at least once, fewer than half adhered to the instructed program. Participants who did not use the app scored higher on the helplessness component of pain catastrophizing at the start of the study and were less likely to have completed 4 years of college. Participants who reported feeling pressured to enroll in the study were also less likely to adhere to the intervention. Compared with participants randomized to wait-list, those in the mindfulness group reported significant improvements in social functioning, even after controlling for pain severity. Participants randomized to the mindfulness intervention also reported significant improvements in helplessness. App usage was not significantly correlated with changes in social functioning or helplessness scores. Conclusions: These results suggest that app-delivered mindfulness meditation is beneficial to patients with chronic pain. Identifying characteristics of patients who were adherent highlights important considerations for clinical settings.

AB  - Background: Increased adherence with enhanced recovery pathways (ERP) is associated with improved outcomes. However, adherence to postoperative elements that rely on patient participation remains suboptimal. Mobile device apps may improve delivery of health education material and have the potential to foster behavior change and improve patient compliance. The objective of this study was to estimate the extent to which a novel mobile device app affects adherence to an ERP for colorectal surgery in comparison to standard written education. Methods: This was a superiority, parallel‐group, assessor‐blind, sham‐controlled randomized trial involving 97 patients undergoing colorectal resection. Participants were randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio into one of two groups: (1) iPad including a novel mobile device app for postoperative education and self‐assessment of recovery, or (2) iPad without the app. The primary outcome measure was mean adherence (%) to a bundle of five postoperative ERP elements requiring patient participation: mobilization, gastrointestinal motility stimulation, breathing exercises, and consumption of oral liquids and nutritional drinks. Results: In the intervention group, app usage was high (94% completed surveys on POD0, 82% on POD1, 72% on POD2). Mean overall adherence to the bundle on the two first postoperative days was similar between groups: 59% (95% CI 52–66%) in the intervention group and 62% (95% CI 56–68%) in the control group [Adjusted mean difference 2.4% (95% CI − 5 to 10%) p = 0.53]. Conclusions: In this randomized trial, access to a mobile health application did not improve adherence to a well‐established enhanced recovery pathway in colorectal surgery patients, when compared to standard written patient education. Future research should evaluate the impact of applications integrating novel behavioral change techniques, particularly in contexts where adherence is low.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phone apps offer a promising medium to deliver psychological interventions. A mobile app based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) was developed and studied in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). OBJECTIVE: To study usage metrics of a mobile ACT intervention and dose-response relationship between usage and improvement in psychological flexibility. METHODS: An RCT was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of different lifestyle interventions for overweight people with psychological stress. This paper presents a secondary analysis of the group that received an 8-week mobile ACT intervention. Most of the analyzed 74 participants were female (n=64, 86%). Their median age was 49.6 (interquartile range, IQR 45.4-55.3) years and their mean level of psychological flexibility, measured with the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II, was 20.4 (95% confidence interval 18.3-22.5). Several usage metrics describing the intensity of use, usage of content, and ways of use were calculated. Linear regression analyses were performed to study the dose-response relationship between usage and the change in psychological flexibility and to identify the usage metrics with strongest association with improvement. Binary logistic regression analyses were further used to assess the role of usage metrics between those who showed improvement in psychological flexibility and those who did not. In addition, associations between usage and baseline participant characteristics were studied. RESULTS: The median number of usage sessions was 21 (IQR 11.8-35), the number of usage days was 15 (IQR 9.0-24), and the number of usage weeks was 7.0 (IQR 4.0-8.0). The participants used the mobile app for a median duration of 4.7 (IQR 3.2-7.2) hours and performed a median of 63 (IQR 46-98) exercises. There was a dose-response relationship between usage and the change in psychological flexibility. The strongest associations with psychological flexibility (results adjusted with gender, age, and baseline psychological variables) were found for lower usage of Self as context related exercises (B=0.22, P=.001) and higher intensity of use, described by the number of usage sessions (B=-0.10, P=.01), usage days (B=-0.17, P=.008), and usage weeks (B=-0.73, P=.02), the number of exercises performed (B=-0.02, P=.03), and the total duration of use (B=-0.30, P=.04). Also, higher usage of Acceptance related exercises (B=-0.18, P=.04) was associated with improvement. Active usage was associated with female gender, older age, and not owning a smart mobile phone before the study. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that active usage of a mobile ACT intervention was associated with improved psychological flexibility. Usage metrics describing intensity of use as well as two metrics related to the usage of content were found to be most strongly associated with improvement.

AB  - PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact of SurvivorCHESS, an eHealth intervention, on physical activity in colon cancer survivors and to explore the impact of SurvivorCHESS on quality of life and distress. METHODS: This was a two‐arm single‐blinded multi‐site randomized controlled trial comparing a control group to an intervention group receiving a smartphone with the SurvivorCHESS program. RESULTS: Participants using SurvivorCHESS (n = 144) increased their moderate to vigorous physical activities from 19.4 min at baseline to 50 min compared to the control group (n = 140) increasing from 15.5 to 40.3 min at 6 months (p = .083) but was not sustained 3 months after the study ended. No significant differences were found between groups over time for quality of life or distress items. Reports of physical symptoms were greater than other categories for distress items. Patients who had a higher body mass index and number of comorbid conditions were less likely to increase their physical activity. Self‐determination theory including autonomous motivation and relatedness was not associated with the outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity did increase over time in both groups and was not significantly different with the use of the eHealth intervention, SurvivorCHESS, compared to the control group. The amount of SurvivorCHESS use was not associated with physical activity. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Increasing physical activity in colon cancer survivors has the potential to improve quality of life and reduce recurrences. Using smartphone‐tracking devices may be useful in helping to change this health behavior.

AB  - Studies on validation of telerehabilitation as an effective platform to help manage as well as reduce burden of care for Low-Back Pain (LBP) are sparse. This study compared the effects of Telerehabilitation-Based McKenzie Therapy (TBMT) and Clinic-Based McKenzie Therapy (CBMT) among patients with LBP. Forty-seven consenting patients with chronic LBP who demonstrated 'directional preference' for McKenzie Extension Protocol (MEP) completed this quasi experimental study. The participants were assigned into either the CBMT or TBMT group using block permuted randomization. Participants in the CBMT and TBMT groups received MEP involving a specific sequence of lumbosacral repeated movements in extension aimed to centralize, decrease, or abolish symptoms, thrice weekly for eight weeks. TBMT is a comparable version of CBMT performed in the home with the assistance of a mobile phone app. Outcomes were assessed at the 4th and 8th weeks of the study in terms of Pain Intensity (PI), Back Extensors Muscles' Endurance (BEME), Activity Limitation (AL), Participation Restriction (PR), and General Health Status (GHS). Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p< 0.05. Within-group comparison across baseline, 4<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> weeks indicate that both CBMT and TBMT had significant effects on PI (p=0.001), BEME (p=0.001), AL (p=0.001), PR (p=0.001) and GHS (p=0.001) respectively. However, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) in the treatment effects between TBMT and CBMT, except for 'vitality' (p=0.011) scale in the GHS where TBMT led to significantly higher mean score. Mobile-app platform of the McKenzie extension protocol has comparable clinical outcomes with the traditional clinic-based McKenzie Therapy, and thus is an effective supplementary platform for care of patients with low-back pain.

AB  - - Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by airflow obstruction due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, for example, cigarette smoke. The pattern of care for people with moderate to very severe COPD often involves regular lengthy hospital admissions, which result in high healthcare costs and an undesirable effect on quality of life. Research over the past decade has focused on innovative methods for developing enabling and assistive technologies that facilitate patient self‐management. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions delivered by computer and by mobile technology versus face‐to‐face or hard copy/digital documentary‐delivered interventions, or both, in facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self‐management among people with COPD. Search methods In November 2016, we searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), which contains trial reports identified through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO, and we handsearched respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials that measured effects of remote and Web 2.0‐based interventions defined as technologies including personal computers (PCs) and applications (apps) for mobile technology, such as iPad, Android tablets, smart phones, and Skype, on behavioural change towards self‐management of COPD. Comparator interventions included face‐to‐face and/or hard copy/digital documentary educational/self‐management support. Data collection and analysis Two review authors (CMcC and MMcC) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full‐text study reports for inclusion. Two review authors (CMcC and AMB) independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We expressed continuous data as mean differences (MDs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) for studies using different outcome measurement scales. Main results We included in our review three studies ( Moy 2015 ; Tabak 2013 ; Voncken‐Brewster 2015 ) with a total of 1580 randomised participants. From Voncken‐Brewster 2015 , we included the subgroup of individuals with a diagnosis of COPD (284 participants) and excluded those at risk of COPD who had not received a diagnosis (1023 participants). As a result, the total population available for analysis included 557 participants; 319 received smart technology to support self‐management and 238 received face‐to‐face verbal/written or digital information and education about self‐management. The average age of participants was 64 years. We included more men than women because the sample from one of the studies consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. These studies measured five of our nine defined outcomes. None of these studies included outcomes such as self‐efficacy, cost‐effectiveness, functional capacity, lung function, or anxiety and depression. All three studies included our primary outcome ‐ health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) or St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). One study reported our other primary outcomes ‐ hospital admissions and acute exacerbations. Two studies included our secondary outcome of physical activity as measured by daily step counts. One study addressed smoking by providing a narrative analysis. Only one study reported adverse events and noted significant differences between groups, with 43 events noted in the intervention group and eight events in the control group (P = 0.001). For studies that measured outcomes at week four, month four, and month six, the effect of smart technology on self‐management and subsequent HRQoL in terms of symptoms and health status was significantly better than when participants received face‐to‐face/digital and/or written support for self‐management of COPD (SMD ‐0.22, 95% confidence i terval (CI) ‐0.40 to ‐0.03; P = 0.02). The single study that reported HRQoL at 12 months described no significant between‐group differences (MD 1.1, 95% CI ‐2.2 to 4.5; P = 0.50). Also, hospitalisations (logistic regression odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% CI 0.8 to 3.2; P = 0.19) and exacerbations (logistic regression OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.8; P = 0.33) did not differ between groups in the single study that reported these outcomes at 12 months. The activity level of people with COPD at week four, month four, and month six was significantly higher when smart technology was used than when face‐to‐face/digital and/or written support was provided (MD 864.06 daily steps between groups, 95% CI 369.66 to 1358.46; P = 0.0006). The only study that measured activity levels at 12 months reported no significant differences between groups (mean ‐108, 95% CI ‐720 to 505; P = 0.73). Participant engagement in this study was not sustained between four and 12 months. The only study that included smoking cessation found no significant treatment effect (OR 1.06, 95%CI 0.43 to 2.66; P = 0.895). Meta‐analyses showed no significant heterogeneity between studies (Chi² = 0.39, P = 0.82; I² = 0% and Chi² = 0.01, P = 0.91; I² = 0%, respectively). Authors' conclusions Although our review suggests that interventions aimed at facilitating, supporting, and sustaining self‐managment in people with COPD and delivered via smart technology significantly improved HRQoL and levels of activity up to six months compared with interventions given through face‐to‐face/digital and/or written support, no firm conclusions can be drawn. This improvement may not be sustained over a long duration. The only included study that measured outcomes up to 12 months highlighted the need to ensure sustained engagement with the technology over time. Limited evidence suggests that using computer and mobile technology for self‐management for people with COPD is not harmful and may be more beneficial for some people than for others, for example, those with an interest in using technology may derive greater benefit. The evidence, provided by three studies at high risk of bias, is of poor quality and is insufficient for advising healthcare professionals, service providers, and members of the public with COPD about the health benefits of using smart technology as an effective means of supporting, encouraging, and sustaining self‐management. Further research that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD is needed. Researchers should provide clear information on how self‐management is assessed and should include longitudinal measures that allow comment on behavioural change. Plain language summary Smart technology for self‐management of COPD Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a long‐term breathing condition that is often caused by smoking. Smart phones, tablets, and PCs may be very helpful for people who have COPD and are living at home because these devices can provide information, education, and guidance on the condition. This information can be personalised for each individual, for example, it can recommend an appropriate exercise programme or give advice on how to stop smoking. Study characteristics We included in our review 557 participants from three studies; 319 received smart technology to support self‐management, and 238 received face‐to‐face verbal/written or digital information and education about self‐management. The average age of participants was 64 years. Our review included more men than women because the sample from one study consisted of war veterans, most of whom were men. Participants used the technology for just four weeks in one study to six months in the second and four months in the third, which also reported data at 12 months. Technology used in these studies included smart phones or PCs. Key results People who received smart technology showed greater improvement in self‐management and quality of life and increased physical activity compared with people who received face‐to‐f ce/digital and/or written support over a four‐week to six‐month period. Also, hospital admissions and exacerbations of COPD did not differ between those who used smart technology and those who did not. Only one study provided information about people who stopped smoking and reported no differences between groups. Quality of the evidence We found only three studies all at high risk of bias ‐ that we could include in this review, and we could conduct analysis on only two of our outcomes (quality of life and increased physical activity). As a result, we think that current information does not show clearly whether smart technology is helpful for people with COPD. We recommend further research of high quality that focuses on outcomes relevant to different stages of COPD. Researchers should be clear about how self‐management is assessed, should report standard trial outcomes, particularly cost, and should include follow‐up for at least one year so they can provide comments on behavioural change and impact of treatment.

AB  - Unhealthy eating is a major risk factor for chronic disease. However, many current strategies to promote healthy eating are not sustainable over the longer-term. More cost-effective wide-reaching initiatives are urgently needed. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, delivered via mobile devices, could provide a solution. This systematic review summarized the evidence on the effect of mHealth interventions for promoting healthy eating in adults. A comprehensive systematic search of five scientific databases was conducted using methods adapted from the Cochrane Handbook. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published up to 1 July 2016, which examined healthy eating interventions delivered via mobile device. Of 879 articles identified, 84 full text articles were potentially eligible and further assessed, and 23 included. Narrative review results indicated small positive effects of mHealth interventions on healthy eating (5/8 trials) and weight loss (5/13 trials). However, the current evidence base is insufficient (studies are of poor quality) to determine conclusive positive effects. More rigorous RCTs with longer-term (>6months) follow-up are warranted to determine if effects are maintained.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety symptoms are common among university students, but many do not receive treatment. This is often because of lack of availability, reluctance to seek help, and not meeting the diagnostic criteria required to access services. Internet‐based interventions, including smartphone apps, can overcome these issues. However, a large number of apps are available, each with little evidence of their effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of a self‐guided mobile app, Feel Stress Free, for the treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms in students. METHODS: A web‐based randomized controlled trial compared a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)‐based mobile app Feel Stress Free with a wait‐list control. University students self‐identified as experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression and were randomized to 6 weeks of intervention (n=84) or control (n=84), unblinded. The app is self‐guided and incorporates behavioral relaxation activities, mood tracking and thought challenging, and minigames. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale online at baseline and every fortnight. RESULTS: At week 6, the primary end point, there was evidence that the Feel Stress Free app reduced depression symptoms (mean difference ‐1.56; 95% CI ‐2.67 to ‐0.44; P=.006) but only very weak evidence that it reduced anxiety symptoms (mean difference ‐1.36; 95% CI ‐2.93 to 0.21; P=.09). At week 4, there was evidence to support the effectiveness of the intervention for anxiety symptoms (mean difference ‐1.94; 95% CI ‐3.11 to ‐0.77; P=.001) and, though weaker, depression symptoms (mean difference ‐1.08; 95% CI ‐2.12 to ‐0.04; P=.04). At week 6, 83% (34/41) of participants indicated that they were using the app weekly or more frequently. CONCLUSIONS: The Feel Stress Free app is a promising mobile intervention for treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in students and overcomes many of the barriers to traditional CBT. Further research is needed to establish its effectiveness at and beyond 6 weeks. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03032952; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03032952.

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions hold great promise for helping smokers quit since these programs can have wide reach and facilitate access to comprehensive, interactive, and adaptive treatment content. However, the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of these programs remain largely untested. Objective: To assess feasibility and acceptability of the My Mobile Advice Program (MyMAP) smoking cessation program and estimate its effects on smoking cessation and medication adherence to inform future research planning. Methods: Sixty-six smokers ready to quit were recruited from a large regional health care system and randomized to one of two mHealth programs: (1) standard self-help including psychoeducational materials and guidance how to quit smoking or (2) an adaptive and interactive program consisting of the same standard mHealth self-help content as controls received plus a) real-time, adaptively tailored advice for managing nicotine withdrawal symptoms and medication side-effects and b) asynchronous secure messaging with a cessation counselor. Participants in both arms were also prescribed a 12-week course of varenicline. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 2 weeks post-target quit date (TQD), 3 months post-TQD, and 5 months post-TQD. Indices of program feasibility and acceptability included acceptability ratings, utilization metrics including use of each MyMAP program component (self-help content, secure messaging, and adaptively tailored advice), and open-ended feedback from participants. Smoking abstinence and medication adherence were also assessed to estimate effects on these treatment outcomes. Results: Utilization data indicated the MyMAP program was actively used, with higher mean program log-ins by experimental than control participants (10.6 vs 2.7, P<.001). The majority of experimental respondents thought the MyMAP program could help other people quit smoking (22/24, 92%) and consistently take their stop-smoking medication (17/22, 97%) and would recommend the program to others (20/23, 87%). They also rated the program as convenient, responsive to their needs, and easy to use. Abstinence rates at 5-month follow-up were 36% in the experimental arm versus 24% among controls (odds ratio 1.79 [0.61-5.19], P=.42). Experimental participants used their varenicline an average of 46 days versus 39 among controls (P=.49). More than two-thirds (22/33, 67%) of experimental participants and three-quarters (25/33, 76%) of controls prematurely discontinued their varenicline use (P=.29). Conclusions: The MyMAP intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable. Since the study was not powered for statistical significance, no conclusions can be drawn about the program’s effects on smoking abstinence or medication adherence, but the overall study results suggest further evaluation in a larger randomized trial is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing timely follow‐up care for patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission is important but often difficult because of resource limitations. Using smartphones to communicate symptoms and biomarkers is a potential alternative. We aimed to compare outpatient management using 2 smartphone apps (IBDsmart for symptoms and IBDoc for fecal calprotectin monitoring) vs standard face‐to‐face care. We hypothesized noninferiority of quality of life and symptoms at 12 months plus a reduction in face‐to‐face appointments in the smartphone app group. METHODS: Inflammatory bowel disease outpatients (previously seen more often than annually) were randomized to smartphone app or standard face‐to‐face care over 12 months. Quality of life and symptoms were measured quarterly for 12 months. Acceptability was measured for gastroenterologists and patients at 12 months. RESULTS: One hundred people (73 Crohn's disease, 49 male, average age 35 years) consented and completed baseline questionnaires (50 in each group). Intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol analyses revealed noninferiority of quality of life and symptom scores at 12 months. Outpatient appointment numbers were reduced in smartphone app care (P < 0.001). There was no difference in number of surgical outpatient appointments or number of disease‐related hospitalizations between groups. Adherence to IBDsmart (50% perfect adherence) was slightly better than adherence to IBDoc (30% perfect adherence). Good acceptability was reported among most gastroenterologists and patients. CONCLUSIONS: Remote symptom and fecal calprotectin monitoring is effective and acceptable. It also reduces the need for face‐to‐face outpatient appointments. Patients with mild‐to‐moderate disease who are not new diagnoses are ideal for this system. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ACTRN12615000342516.

AB  - AIMS: To test the feasibility and potential efficacy of remotely supported intermittent low-energy diets (ILEDs) and continuous low-energy diets (CLEDs) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial comparing the two approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-nine adults with overweight/obesity and T2D (<=8 years duration) were randomized 1:1 to CLED (8 weeks/56 days of daily Optifast 820 kcal (3430 kJ) diet) or isoenergetic ILED (2 days of Optifast and 5 days of a Mediterranean diet/week for 28 weeks). Weight maintenance/continued weight loss was undertaken for the remainder of the 52 weeks. Both groups received frequent telephone or the Oviva app support. Feasibility outcomes included study uptake, retention, app usage, dietary adherence, weight loss and change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 52 weeks. RESULTS: We enrolled 39 ILED and 40 CLED participants and 27 (69%) ILED and 30 CLED (75%) attended the 52-week follow-up. Eighty-nine per cent (70 of 79) started using the app and 86% (44 of 51) still used the app at 52 weeks. Intention-to-treat analysis at 52 weeks showed percentage weight loss was mean (95% confidence interval) -5.4% (-7.6, -3.1%) for ILED and -6.0% (-7.9, -4.0%) for CLED. HbA1c <48 mmol/mol was achieved in 42% of both groups. Mean (95% confidence interval) changes in the T2D medication effect score were 0.0008 (-0.3, 0.3) for ILED and -0.5 (-0.8, -0.3) for CLED. CONCLUSION: The study shows the feasibility and potential efficacy of remotely delivered ILED and CLED programmes for weight loss and HbA1c reduction, and the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial comparing the two approaches.

AB  - In an increasingly urbanised world where mental health is currently in crisis, interventions to increase human engagement and connection with the natural environment are one of the fastest growing, most widely accessible, and cost‐effective ways of improving human wellbeing. This study aimed to provide an evaluation of a smartphone app‐based wellbeing intervention. In a randomised controlled trial study design, the app prompted 582 adults, including a subgroup of adults classified by baseline scores on the Recovering Quality of Life scale as having a common mental health problem (n = 148), to notice the good things about urban nature (intervention condition) or built spaces (active control). There were statistically significant and sustained improvements in wellbeing at one‐month follow‐up. Importantly, in the noticing urban nature condition, compared to a built space control, improvements in quality of life reached statistical significance for all adults and clinical significance for those classified as having a mental health difficulty. This improvement in wellbeing was partly explained by significant increases in nature connectedness and positive affect. This study provides the first controlled experimental evidence that noticing the good things about urban nature has strong clinical potential as a wellbeing intervention and social prescription.

AB  -  A	three-armed,	six-week	randomized controlled	trial	was	conducted	between	16-22	weeks	gestation (baseline) and	24-28 weeks gestation (final).	Previously sedentary women (n=11)	were randomized	to	one	of	three	groups	following baseline: Group	1)	Reduce	sedentary	time	(ST) by	interrupting	prolonged	sitting	(n=5);	Group	2)	Reduce	ST via	walking	30	minutes	most	days	of	the	week	(n=3);	or	Group	3)	Continue	with	daily routines (n=3). Participants	(Groups	1	and	2)	received	Fitbit® monitors	to	promote  physical	activity	(PA)	behavior	change  Data	was	collected	over	a	7-day	period	during baseline	and	final. PA was assessed	with activPALTM, Sensewear® armband,	Fitbit®,	and	PA record.	Measured weight	was compared	to	the	2009	Institute	of	Medicine	(IOM)	recommended	rate	of weekly	weight gain.	Dietary	intake	was	assessed	using	a	3-day	weighed	diet	record.	
Participants	underwent	a 75-gram	2-hour	oral	glucose	tolerance	test (final). No significant	differences were	found; descriptive results are	as follows. One participant	in	each	group	decreased ST from	baseline	to	final	(-3.63%, -4.07%,	-13.75%,	per	group,	respectively). Groups 1	and	2	decreased	ST	in	bouts > 60	minutes	(152.40	+ 103.34	minutes	baseline,	133.18	+ 19.88	minutes	final;	202.55 + 60.51	minutes	baseline,	175.02	+ 89.84	minutes	final,	respectively),	whereas,	Group	3 increased	(203.95	+ 92.89	minutes	baseline,	224.69	+ 132.18	minutes	final).	A	moderate effect size	was found for	reducing	prolonged	ST	between	intervention	groups	and	Group	3 (0.66).	Group	1,	decreased	moderate	vigorous	physical	activity	(MVPA) from	baseline (132 + 96.16 minutes)	to	final (40.5 + 34.64	minutes).	Groups	2	(16.66 + 22.30 minutes	baseline;	53.66 + 85.27 minutes	final)	and	3	(UC;	73.33 + 62.26 minutes	baseline;	84.33 + 84.67 minutes final)	increased. A	small	effect	size	was	demonstrated	between	intervention	groups	and	Group	3 (0.48). Groups 1	and	2 met the	intervention	goal 58.4-98.8% and	0- 213% of	the	time,	respectively.	A positive	relationship for increased ST, higher	fasting,	60,	120-minute blood	glucose	levels and	increased	calorie	consumption was	found.	
Based	on	the	IOM guidelines,	one	participant	gained	less,	one	met	and	six	exceeded	 recommendations. Based	on	preliminary	data,	finding	effective	strategies to	decrease	ST  during	pregnancy remains	important.

AB  - Objective: Mobile technology has the potential to radically improve addiction treatment and continuing care by offering emotional and instrumental support anywhere and just in time. This is particularly important in addiction because timing is critical to preventing relapse. Although most experts consider alcoholism to be a chronic disease, providers do not typically offer ongoing support for relapse prevention after patients complete treatment, even though a central characteristic of alcoholism and other addictive behaviors is their chronically relapsing nature.A‐CHESS is a smartphone‐based system for preventing relapse to heavy drinking among people leaving active alcohol dependence treatment. A‐CHESS is designed to improve competence, social relatedness, and motivation, the three tenets of self‐determination theory. This paper reports on the relative impact and use of A‐CHESS 4 months after patients entered the study and discusses implications of the results on treating addiction and chronic diseases generally. Methods: A total of 349 individuals with alcohol dependence leaving residential treatment were randomly assigned to either receive A‐CHESS + Treatment as usual or treatment as usual (standard aftercare). Patients came from two treatment agencies, one in the Midwest and one in the Northeast. Patients assigned to A‐CHESS received a smartphone for 8 months and were followed for 12. The authors analyzed use patterns during the first 4 months of use by those receiving A‐CHESS. Results: Participants used A‐CHESS heavily and sustained their use over time. Ninety‐four percent of A‐CHESS participants used the application during the first week after residential treatment. At week 16, almost 80% continued to access A‐CHESS. Participants with alcohol and drug dependence showed higher levels of system use than those with alcohol dependence only.Participants with a mental health diagnosis had slightly lower levels of use at the end of the intervention period (week 16), although more than 70% still accessed the system.Conclusions: These findings illustrate that patients with alcohol dependence, alcohol and drug dependence, and mental health issues will use smartphone applications such as A‐CHESS for ongoing support, resources, and information, thus extending patient care if given the opportunity. Further analysis is needed to determine whether sustained A‐CHESS use improves outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cue exposure therapy (CET) is a psychological approach developed to prepare individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) for confronting alcohol and associated stimuli in real life. CET has shown promise when treating AUD in group sessions, but it is unknown whether progressing from group sessions to using a mobile phone app is an effective delivery pathway. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) whether CET as aftercare would increase the effectiveness of primary treatment with cognitive behavior therapy, and (2) whether CET delivered through a mobile phone app would be similarly effective to CET via group sessions. METHODS: A total of 164 individuals with AUD were randomized to one of three groups: CET as group aftercare (CET group), CET as fully automated mobile phone app aftercare (CET app), or aftercare as usual. Study outcomes were assessed face‐to‐face at preaftercare, postaftercare, and again at 6 months after aftercare treatment. Generalized mixed models were used to compare the trajectories of the groups over time on drinking, cravings, and use of urge‐specific coping skills (USCS). RESULTS: In all, 153 of 164 individuals (93%) completed assessments both at posttreatment and 6‐month follow‐up assessments. No differences in the trajectories of predicted means were found between the experimental groups (CET group and app) compared with aftercare as usual on drinking and craving outcomes over time. Both CET group (predicted mean difference 5.99, SE 2.59, z=2.31, P=.02) and the CET app (predicted mean difference 4.90, SE 2.26, z=2.31, P=.02) showed increased use of USCS compared to aftercare as usual at posttreatment, but this effect was reduced at the 6‐month follow‐up. No differences were detected between the two experimental CET groups on any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: CET with USCS delivered as aftercare either via group sessions or a mobile phone app did not increase the effectiveness of primary treatment. This suggests that CET with USCS may not be an effective psychological approach for the aftercare of individuals treated for AUD.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of the Jawbone UP platform for increasing physical activity and improving sleep quality among African American college women using a randomized controlled trial. Participants were college-aged (19.9 +/- 1.7 years) African American women (N = 69) at a southeastern midsize university in United States. The trial began in September 2013 and concluded in February 2014. Each group received similar brief training to use the respective platforms and weekly emails encouraged regular continued engagement. There was a significant difference at the 8-week follow-up, such that the intervention group decreased step counts relative to the comparison app (9,378 vs. 11,287 steps; p = .02). For sleep, neither group demonstrated any changes in sleep duration, sleep onset latency, wakefulness after sleep onset, or sleep efficiency at the 6-week posttest or 8-week follow-up. This study found no evidence for initial efficacy as a stand-alone tool for increasing physical activity or improving sleep. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - ABSTRACT Bilingualism has been linked to improved executive function and delayed onset of dementia, but it is unknown whether similar benefits can be obtained later in life through deliberate intervention. Given the logistical hurdles of second language acquisition in a randomized trial for older adults, few interventional studies have been done thus far. However, recently developed smartphone apps offer a convenient means to acquire skills in a second language and can be compared with brain training apps specifically designed to improve executive function. In a randomized clinical trial, 76 adults aged 65‐75 were assigned to either 16 weeks of Spanish learning using the app Duolingo 30 minutes a day, an equivalent amount of brain training using the app BrainHQ, or a waitlist control condition. Executive function was assessed before and after the intervention with preregistered (NCT03638882) tests previously linked to better performance in bilinguals. For two of the primary measures: incongruent Stroop color naming and 2‐back accuracy, Duolingo provided equivalent benefits as BrainHQ compared to a control group. On reaction time for N‐back and Simon tests, the BrainHQ group alone experienced strong gains over the other two groups. Duolingo was rated as more enjoyable. These results suggest that app‐based language learning may provide some similar benefits as brain training in improving executive function in seniors but has less impact on processing speed. However, future advancements in app design may optimize not only the acquisition of the target language but also the side benefits of the language learning experience.

AB  - Introduction: Reminiscence therapy has been shown to improve mental health and quality of life in dementia; however, reminiscence therapy is often delivered by therapists instead of being technology‐enabled. This study evaluated the preliminary efficacy of Memory Matters (MM), an iPad reminiscence game on mood, social interaction, quality of life, and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Methods: This pilot study used an experimental design where participants were randomized on a 2:2:1 ratio to three arms: individual MM (one‐on‐one with an interventionist), group MM (2â€“3 participants per session), or waitlist control. MM was delivered for 30 minutes a session, twice a week for six weeks, followed by six‐week self‐play. Outcomes were assessed at the baseline, six weeks, and 12 weeks by data collectors blinded to group allocation. Data were analyzed using intention‐to‐treat analysis and analysis of covariance. Results: The sample (n = 80) was 82.1 Â± 7.8 years in age with 58% female, 15.3 Â± 3.3 years of education. Mood did not differ, except for apathetic mood between group MM and control arm at 12 weeks (P = .051). Social interaction improved for individual MM compared with group MM (t = 2.38, P = .017) and control (t = 2.84, P = .005) at six weeks, but not 12 weeks. Other outcomes did not differ. Discussion: MM improved social interaction and possibly mood. Future studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of MM with a sufficient sample size.

Methods: Medline, Pubmed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase were searched from 2003 to the present, looking at mHealth and attrition or dropout. Studies looking at chronic disease with measures of dropout were included.

Results: Of 830 studies identified in the literature search, 16 were included in the review and meta-analysis (results presented below). Chronic disease management apps had an overall dropout rate of 47%. Apps targeting metabolic disease had a lower rate of 32%. The studies were varied, with high heterogeneity (I2>99%).

Conclusion: Dropout rates in mHealth interventions are high, but lower in apps targeting metabolic disease. Reducing dropout rates will make these apps more effective for disease management in the long term.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With a growing focus on patient interaction with health management, mobile apps are increasingly used to deliver behavioral health interventions. The large variation in these mobile health apps-their target patient group, health behavior, and behavioral change strategies-has resulted in a large but incohesive body of literature. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving health behaviors and outcomes and to examine the inclusion and effectiveness of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in mobile health apps. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science were systematically searched for articles published between 2014 and 2019 that evaluated mobile apps for health behavior change. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria. Data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by a second reviewer. RESULTS: A total of 52 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis-37 studies focused on physical activity, diet, or a combination of both, 11 on drug and alcohol use, and 4 on mental health. Participant perceptions were generally positive-only one app was rated as less helpful and satisfactory than the control-and the studies that measured engagement and usability found relatively high study completion rates (mean 83%; n=18, N=39) and ease-of-use ratings (3 significantly better than control, 9/15 rated >70%). However, there was little evidence of changed behavior or health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There was no strong evidence in support of the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving health behaviors or outcomes because few studies found significant differences between the app and control groups. Further research is needed to identify the BCTs that are most effective at promoting behavior change. Improved reporting is necessary to accurately evaluate the mobile health app effectiveness and risk of bias.

AB  - Objective: Scalable, accessible forms of behavioral therapy for migraine prevention are needed. We assessed the feasibility and acceptability of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) delivered by a smartphone application (app) in the Primary Care setting. Methods: This pilot study was a non‐blinded, randomized, parallel‐arm controlled trial of adults with migraine and 4+ headache days/month. Eligible participants spoke English and owned a smartphone. All participants were given the RELAXaHEAD app which includes an electronic headache diary. Participants were randomized to receive 1 of the 2 versions of the app‐one with PMR and the other without PMR. The primary outcomes were measures of feasibility (adherence to the intervention and diary entries during the 90‐day interval) and acceptability (satisfaction levels). We conducted exploratory analyses to determine whether there was a change in Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores or a change in headache days. Results: Of 139 participants (77 PMR, 62 control), 116 (83%) were female, mean age was 41.7 ± 12.8 years. Most patients 108/139 (78%) had moderate‐severe disability. Using a 1‐5 Likert scale, participants found the app easy to use (mean 4.2 ± 0.7) and stated that they would be happy to engage in the PMR intervention again (mean 4.3 ± 0.6). For the first 6 weeks, participants practiced PMR 2‐4 days/week. Mean per session duration was 11.1 ± 8.3 minutes. Relative to the diary‐only group, the PMR group showed a greater non‐significant decline in mean MIDAS scores (−8.7 vs −22.7, P =.100) corresponding to a small‐moderate mean effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.38). Conclusion: Smartphone‐delivered PMR may be an acceptable, accessible form of therapy for migraine. Mean effects show a small‐moderate mean effect size in disability scores.

AB  - Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Migraine are comorbid neurologic conditions. Migraine prevalence is three times higher in the MS clinic population compared to the general population, and patients with MS and migraine are more symptomatic than patients with MS without migraine. Objective: We sought to conduct a pilot feasibility and acceptability study of the RELAXaHEAD app in MS‐Migraine patients and to assess whether there was any change in migraine disability and MS pain‐related disability. Methods: Randomized controlled study of patients with MS‐migraine ages 18–80 years with 4+ headache days/ month who were willing to engage in smartphone based behavioral therapy. Half received the RELAXaHEAD app with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and the other half received the app without the PMR. Data was collected for 90 days on measures of recruitment, retention, engagement, and adherence to RELAXaHEAD. Preliminary data was also collected on migraine disability (MIDAS) and MS pain (PES). Results: Sixty‐two subjects with MS‐migraine were enrolled in the study (34 in PMR arm, 28 in monitored usual care arm). On average, during the 90 days, participants played the PMR on average 1.8 times per week, and for 12.9 min on days it was played. Forty‐one percent (14/34) of the participants played the PMR two or more times weekly on average. Data was entered into the daily diaries, on average, 49% (44/90) of the days. There were major challenges in reaching subjects in follow‐up for the efficacy data, and there was no significant change in migraine disability (MIDAS) scores or MS Pain (PES) scores from baseline to the endpoints. During the six‐month follow‐up, most patients felt either positively or neutral about the relaxation therapy. Conclusion: There was interest in scalable accessible forms of behavioral therapy to treat migraine and MS‐related pain in patients with MS and comorbid migraine. Similar to prior studies, a significant minority were willing to practice the PMR at least twice weekly. In the societal shift from telephone to more text and internet‐based interactions, follow up was challenging, but those reached indicated that they appreciated the PMR and would recommend it to others. Future work should focus on engagement and efficacy.

AB  - Introduction: Although hand temperature and electromyograph biofeedback have evidence for migraine prevention, to date, no study has evaluated heartrate variability (HRV) biofeedback for migraine. Methods: 2‐arm randomized trial comparing an 8‐week app‐based HRV biofeedback (HeartMath) to waitlist control. Feasibility/acceptability outcomes included number and duration of sessions, satisfaction, barriers and adverse events. Primary clinical outcome was Migraine‐Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQv2). Results: There were 52 participants (26/arm). On average, participants randomized to the Hearthmath group completed 29 sessions (SD = 29, range: 2–86) with an average length of 6:43 min over 36 days (SD = 27, range: 0, 88) before discontinuing. 9/29 reported technology barriers. 43% said that they were likely to recommend Heartmath to others. Average MSQv2 decreases were not significant between the Heartmath and waitlist control (estimate = 0.3, 95% CI = −3.1 ‐ 3.6). High users of Heartmath reported a reduction in MSQv2 at day 30 (−12.3 points, p = 0.010) while low users did not (p = 0.765). Discussion: App‐based HRV biofeedback was feasible and acceptable on a time‐limited basis for people with migraine. Changes in the primary clinical outcome did not differ between biofeedback and control; however, high users of the app reported more benefit than low users.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern. Although effective treatments exist, affected individuals face many barriers to receiving traditional care. Smartphones are carried by nearly 2 thirds of the U.S. population, offering a promising new option to overcome many of these barriers by delivering self‐help interventions through applications (apps). As there is limited research on apps for trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms, we conducted a pilot feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy trial of PTSD Coach, a self‐management smartphone app for PTSD. METHOD: A community sample of trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms (N = 49) were randomized to 1 month using PTSD Coach or a waitlist condition. Self‐report assessments were completed at baseline, postcondition, and 1‐month follow‐up. Following the postcondition assessment, waitlist participants were crossed‐over to receive PTSD Coach. RESULTS: Participants reported using the app several times per week, throughout the day across multiple contexts, and endorsed few barriers to use. Participants also reported that PTSD Coach components were moderately helpful and that they had learned tools and skills from the app to manage their symptoms. Between conditions effect size estimates were modest (d = ‐0.25 to ‐0.33) for PTSD symptom improvement, but not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that PTSD Coach is a feasible and acceptable intervention. Findings regarding efficacy are less clear as the study suffered from low statistical power; however, effect size estimates, patterns of within group findings, and secondary analyses suggest that further development and research on PTSD Coach is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nonadherence and medication errors are common among patients with complex drug regimens. Apps for smartphones and tablets are effective for improving adherence, but they have not been tested in elderly patients with complex chronic conditions and who typically have less experience with this type of technology. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to design, implement, and evaluate a medication self‐management app (called ALICE) for elderly patients taking multiple medications with the intention of improving adherence and safe medication use. METHODS: A single‐blind randomized controlled trial was conducted with a control and an experimental group (N=99) in Spain in 2013. The characteristics of ALICE were specified based on the suggestions of 3 nominal groups with a total of 23 patients and a focus group with 7 professionals. ALICE was designed for Android and iOS to allow for the personalization of prescriptions and medical advice, showing images of each of the medications (the packaging and the medication itself) together with alerts and multiple reminders for each alert. The randomly assigned patients in the control group received oral and written information on the safe use of their medications and the patients in the experimental group used ALICE for 3 months. Pre and post measures included rate of missed doses and medication errors reported by patients, scores from the 4‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS‐4), level of independence, self‐perceived health status, and biochemical test results. In the experimental group, data were collected on their previous experience with information and communication technologies, their rating of ALICE, and their perception of the level of independence they had achieved. The intergroup intervention effects were calculated by univariate linear models and ANOVA, with the pre to post intervention differences as the dependent variables. RESULTS: Data were obtained from 99 patients (48 and 51 in the control and experimental groups, respectively). Patients in the experimental group obtained better MMAS‐4 scores (P<.001) and reported fewer missed doses of medication (P=.02). ALICE only helped to significantly reduce medication errors in patients with an initially higher rate of errors (P<.001). Patients with no experience with information and communication technologies reported better adherence (P<.001), fewer missed doses (P<.001), and fewer medication errors (P=.02). The mean satisfaction score for ALICE was 8.5 out of 10. In all, 45 of 51 patients (88%) felt that ALICE improved their independence in managing their medications. CONCLUSIONS: The ALICE app improves adherence, helps reduce rates of forgetting and of medication errors, and increases perceived independence in managing medication. Elderly patients with no previous experience with information and communication technologies are capable of effectively using an app designed to help them take their medicine more safely.

AB  - Objective: Persons with epilepsy (PWE), especially those with limited education backgrounds from developing countries, are challenged by complicated medication regimens, debilitating seizures, and stigmatization in their daily life. Consequently, it is difficult for physicians to ensure medication adherence. This study validates a novel mobile application which was hypothesized to increase medication adherence and self‐management skills in PWE. Created by medical professionals, the application included behavioral and educational components and was built to be easy‐to‐understand for those of socio‐economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Methods: This was a parallel, two‐armed randomized controlled trial in which a total of 96 participants were enrolled from a Neurology Outpatient Department into a control standard care group and a mobile application group that used the smartphone application (app) in addition to the standard medical treatment. The app was intuitive and easy to understand for those coming from a socio‐economically disadvantaged background. Medication adherence and self‐efficacy were assessed with the Morisky Green and Levine Scale (MGLS) and the Epilepsy Self Efficacy Scale (ESES). Patients were reassessed 12 weeks later. Change in seizure frequency following administration of the application was a secondary outcome. Results: In an intent‐to‐treat analysis, the mobile application interventional group showed over a 60% increase in the proportion of medication adherence (P < 0.0001). The mean self‐efficacy score for the mobile application group was increased from 269.5 to 289.75 (P < 0.0001). The control group showed no statistically significant increases in either the proportion adherent or mean self‐efficacy scores. Significance: This study demonstrated the statistically significant performance of a mobile application in improving medication adherence and self‐management skills in Indian persons with epilepsy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether an in‐person mindfulness‐based resilience training (MBRT) program or a smartphone‐delivered resiliency‐based intervention improved stress, well‐being, and burnout in employees at a major tertiary health care institution. METHODS: Sixty participants were randomized to a 6‐week MBRT, a resiliency‐based smartphone intervention, or an active control group. Stress, well‐being, and burnout were assessed at baseline, at program completion, and 3 months postintervention. RESULTS: Both the MBRT and the smartphone groups showed improvements in well‐being, whereas only the MBRT group showed improvements in stress and emotional burnout over time. The control group did not demonstrate sustained improvement on any outcome. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that brief, targeted interventions improve psychological outcomes and point to the need for larger scale studies comparing the individual and combined treatments that can inform development of tailored, effective, and low‐cost programs for health care workers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite substantial improvements in technology and the increased demand for technology‐enabled behavioral health tools among consumers, little progress has been made in easing the burden of mental illness. This may be because of the inherent challenges of conducting traditional clinical trials in a rapidly evolving technology landscape. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to validate the effectiveness of Pacifica, a popular commercially available app for the self‐management of mild‐to‐moderate stress, anxiety, and depression. METHODS: A total of 500 adults with mild‐to‐moderate anxiety or depression were recruited from in‐app onboarding to participate in a randomized waitlist controlled trial of Pacifica. We conducted an all‐virtual study, recruiting, screening, and randomizing participants through a Web‐based participant portal. Study participants used the app for 1 month, with no level of use required, closely mimicking real‐world app usage. Participants in the waitlist group were given access to the app after 1 month. Measurements included self‐reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and self‐efficacy. We performed an intent‐to‐treat analysis to examine the interactive effects of time and condition. RESULTS: We found significant interactions between time and group. Participants in the active condition demonstrated significantly greater decreases in depression, anxiety, and stress and increases in self‐efficacy. Although we did not find a relationship between overall engagement with the app and symptom improvement, participants who completed relatively more thought record exercises sustained improvements in their symptoms through the 2‐month follow‐up to a greater degree than those who completed fewer. In addition, we found that participants who reported concomitantly taking psychiatric medications during the trial benefitted less from the app, as measured by the symptoms of anxiety and stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that Pacifica, a popular commercially available self‐help app, is effective in reducing self‐reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, particularly among individuals who utilize thought records and are not taking psychiatric medication.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ischemic heart disease and stroke have been considered as the first global leading cause of death in last decades [1]. Blood pressure (BP) management is one of the easiest ways suggested for preventing and controlling cardiovascular diseases before the patient develops complications and death-following outcomes. Appearance of technology advancements in the health system has motivated researchers and health providers to study its different aspects and applications in order to improve disease prevention and management. Following these efforts, mobile health (mHealth) technologies were presented to provide people with fast and easier- to- use services. Although there are some unsolved challenges, these technologies have become popular among many people. As an important part of mHealth, mobile applications (apps) have been the focused subject of many studies in the last decade. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the potential effects of mobile apps designed for BP management by scrutinizing the related studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases in December 2016: Medline (PubMed), National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Education Resources Information Center(ERIC), Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. No language restriction and start point limitation were imposed. Selection criteria: We included studies that evaluated and assessed mobile apps for BP management and related clinical trials that considered mobile app as the only difference between intervention and control groups. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors applied the eligibility criteria, extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. RESULTS: Literature search resulted in 13 included studies and 27 reviews. 12 records of 13 included studies identified as interventional studies. The review showed that the mobile apps may improve individual's BP condition and medication adherence. CONCLUSION: Most of the studies had emphasized positive effects of mobile apps in BP management. However, there is a necessity for performing further investigations due to the identified issues in this study such as low number of participants and limited intervention period in randomized controlled trials, and interventions limited to only hypertensive or high-risked individual.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness recently attracted growing interest beyond classical therapeutic contexts and has been adopted in preventive labor contexts and occupational health. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness training app regarding work and health indicators. METHODS: Participants were employees and assigned randomly to the intervention and control groups. 146 employed participants in the intervention group used the mobile application '7mind' for 14 days. Comparisons were made with 160 employed participants from the control group, who were given access to the app after finishing the study (wait‐list control). RESULTS: After two weeks of use, significant effects of the training were indicated by better results for the intervention group as compared to the control group. Some of the effect sizes can be considered as large: participants in the intervention group improved in measures of mindfulness, work engagement, job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, emotional intelligence, innovation and creativity, and self‐efficacy. CONCLUSION: Conventional mindfulness training programs are organized in groups. Our study demonstrates for the first time the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness training app in the work context. The mobile app offers an easy and flexible access to training mindfulness and improving work and health‐related indicators.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electronic (eHealth) and mobile (mHealth) technologies may be a useful adjunct to clinicians treating patients with chronic pain. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of eHealth and mHealth interventions that do not require clinician contact or feedback on pain-related outcomes recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) guidelines in adults with chronic pain. METHODS: We searched four databases and included English language randomized controlled trials of ambulatory adults with chronic pain from January, 1 2000, to January 31, 2018, with interventions that are independent of clinician contact or feedback. In the meta-analysis, outcomes were assessed at short- (three months or less), intermediate- (four to six months), and long-term (seven or more months) follow-up. RESULTS: Seventeen randomized controlled trials (N = 2,496) were included in the meta-analysis. Both eHealth and mHealth interventions had a significant effect on pain intensity at short- and intermediate-term follow-up. Similarly, a significant but small effect was observed for depression at short- and intermediate-term follow-up and self-efficacy at short-term follow-up. Finally, a significant effect was observed for pain catastrophizing at short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth and mHealth interventions had significant effects on multiple short- and intermediate-term outcome measures recommended in the IMMPACT guidelines. Given widespread availability and low cost to patients, clinicians treating patients with chronic pain could consider using eHealth and mHealth interventions as part of a multidisciplinary pain treatment strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of mindfulness‐based interventions to reduce anxiety or improve quality of life (QoL) in patients with cardiac pathologies is well established. However, there is scarce information on the efficacy, applicability, and safety of these interventions in adult patients with an implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator (ICD). In this study, we examined their efficacy on QoL, psychological and biomedical variables, as well as the applicability and safety of a mindfulness‐based intervention in patients with an ICD. METHODS: Ninety‐six patients with an ICD were randomized into two intervention groups and a control group. The interventions involved training in mindfulness‐based emotional regulation, either face‐to‐face or using the "REM Volver a casa" mobile phone application (app). RESULTS: The sample presented medium‐high QoL baseline scores (mean: 68), low anxiety (6.84) and depression (3.89), average mindfulness disposition (128), and cardiological parameters similar to other ICD populations. After the intervention, no significant differences were found in the variables studied between the intervention and control groups. Retention was average (59%), and there were no adverse effects due to the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: After training in mindfulness‐based emotional regulation (face‐to‐face or via app), no significant differences were found in the QoL or psychological or biomedical variables in patients with an ICD. The intervention proved to be safe, with 59% retention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current study was performed to assess the evidence for effects of therapeutic intervention with mobile device applications (apps) for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). DESIGN: The main methodology of the current study was systematic review with meta-analysis. SETTING: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for mobile device apps for individuals with ASD were considered for review in the current study. PATIENTS: The target population was individuals clinically diagnosed with ASD. INTERVENTIONS: Applications that are operable on a smart (mobile) device and interactive with users. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcomes were based on standardised mean differences in pretrial and post-trial scales in each control and intervention group. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1100 studies (after duplicate removal), 7 RCTs were selected for final analysis. Of the seven studies, two RCTs were further analysed for effects based on the visual and fine motor subscales of the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, which favoured the intervention groups (standardised mean difference (SMD)=0.41, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.80; SMD=0.41, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.80), without either having any heterogeneity (p>0.1) or publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is still early to draw a conclusion, available studies are showing promise for use of mobile device apps for treatment of individuals with ASD. More well-designed and large-scale studies focused on improving behavioural symptoms of ASD are warranted. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019128362.

AB  - Importance: Medication nonadherence accounts for up to half of uncontrolled hypertension. Smartphone applications (apps) that aim to improve adherence are widely available but have not been rigorously evaluated. Objective: To determine if the Medisafe smartphone app improves self‐reported medication adherence and blood pressure control. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a 2‐arm, randomized clinical trial (Medication Adherence Improvement Support App For Engagement‐Blood Pressure [MedISAFE‐BP]). Participants were recruited through an online platform and were mailed a home blood pressure cuff to confirm eligibility and to provide follow‐up measurements. Of 5577 participants who were screened, 412 completed consent, met inclusion criteria (confirmed uncontrolled hypertension, taking 1 to 3 antihypertensive medications), and were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to intervention or control. Interventions: Intervention arm participants were instructed to download and use the Medisafe app, which includes reminder alerts, adherence reports, and optional peer support. Main Outcomes and Measures: Co‐primary outcomes were change from baseline to 12 weeks in self‐reported medication adherence, measured by the Morisky medication adherence scale (MMAS) (range, 0‐8, with lower scores indicating lower adherence), and change in systolic blood pressure. Results: Participants (n = 411; 209 in the intervention group and 202 controls) had a mean age of 52.0 years and mean body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, of 35.5; 247 (60%) were female, and 103 (25%) were black. After 12 weeks, the mean (SD) score on the MMAS improved by 0.4 (1.5) among intervention participants and remained unchanged among controls (between‐group difference: 0.4; 95% CI, 0.1‐0.7; P = .01). The mean (SD) systolic blood pressure at baseline was 151.4 (9.0) mm Hg and 151.3 (9.4) mm Hg, among intervention and control participants, respectively. After 12 weeks, the mean (SD) systolic blood pressure decreased by 10.6 (16.0) mm Hg among intervention participants and 10.1 (15.4) mm Hg among controls (between‐group difference: ‐0.5; 95% CI, ‐3.7 to 2.7; P = .78). Conclusions and Relevance: Among individuals with poorly controlled hypertension, patients randomized to use a smartphone app had a small improvement in self‐reported medication adherence but no change in systolic blood pressure compared with controls.

AB  - This feasibility study evaluated the effects of an individual‐level intervention to target office workers total and prolonged sedentary behaviour during working hours, using an e‐health smartphone application. A three‐arm (Prompt‐30 or 60 min Intervention arm and a No‐Prompt Comparison arm), quasi‐randomised intervention was conducted over 12 weeks. Behavioural outcomes (worktime sitting, standing, stepping, prolonged sitting, and physical activity) were monitored using accelerometers and anthropometrics measured at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Cardiometabolic measures were taken at baseline and 12 weeks. Fifty‐six office workers (64% female) completed baseline assessments. The Prompt‐60 arm was associated with a reduction in occupational sitting time at 6 (−46.8 min/8 h workday [95% confidence interval = −86.4, −6.6], p < 0.05) and 12 weeks (−69.6 min/8 h workday [−111.0, −28.2], p < 0.05) relative to the No‐Prompt Comparison arm. Sitting was primarily replaced with standing in both arms (p > 0.05). Both Intervention arms reduced time in prolonged sitting bouts at 12 weeks (Prompt‐30: −27.0 [−99.0, 45.0]; Prompt‐60: −25.8 [−98.4, 47.4] min/8 h workday; both p > 0.05). There were no changes in steps or cardiometabolic risk. Findings highlight the potential of a smartphone e‐health application, suggesting 60 min prompts may present an optimal frequency to reduce total occupational sedentary behaviour.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile apps present a potentially cost-effective tool for delivering behavior change interventions at scale, but no known studies have tested the efficacy of apps as a tool to specifically increase vegetable consumption among overweight adults. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the initial efficacy and user acceptability of a theory-driven mobile app to increase vegetable consumption. METHODS: A total of 17 overweight adults aged 42.0 (SD 7.3) years with a body mass index (BMI) of 32.0 (SD 3.5) kg/m(2) were randomized to the use of Vegethon (a fully automated theory-driven mobile app enabling self-monitoring of vegetable consumption, goal setting, feedback, and social comparison) or a wait-listed control condition. All participants were recruited from an ongoing 12-month weight loss trial (parent trial). Researchers who performed data analysis were blinded to condition assignment. The primary outcome measure was daily vegetable consumption, assessed using an adapted version of the validated Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire administered at baseline and 12 weeks after randomization. An analysis of covariance was used to assess differences in 12-week vegetable consumption between intervention and control conditions, controlling for baseline. App usability and satisfaction were measured via a 21-item post-intervention questionnaire. RESULTS: Using intention-to-treat analyses, all enrolled participants (intervention: 8; control: 9) were analyzed. Of the 8 participants randomized to the intervention, 5 downloaded the app and logged their vegetable consumption a mean of 0.7 (SD 0.9) times per day, 2 downloaded the app but did not use it, and 1 never downloaded it. Consumption of vegetables was significantly greater among the intervention versus control condition at the end of the 12-week pilot study (adjusted mean difference: 7.4 servings; 95% CI 1.4-13.5; P=.02). Among secondary outcomes defined a priori, there was significantly greater consumption of green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables, and dark yellow vegetables (adjusted mean difference: 2.6, 1.6, and 0.8 servings; 95% CI 0.1-5.0, 0.1-3.2, and 0.3-1.4; P=.04, P=.04, and P=.004, respectively). Participants reported positive experiences with the app, including strong agreement with the statements "I have found Vegethon easy to use" and "I would recommend Vegethon to a friend" (mean 4.6 (SD 0.6) and 4.2 (SD 0.8), respectively, (on a 5-point scale). CONCLUSIONS: Vegethon demonstrated initial efficacy and user acceptability. A mobile app intervention may be useful for increasing vegetable consumption among overweight adults. The small sample size prevented precise estimates of effect sizes. Given the improved health outcomes associated with increases in vegetable consumption, these findings indicate the need for larger, longer-term evaluations of Vegethon and similar technologies among overweight adults and other suitable target groups.

AB  - Background: Mobile applications (apps) have been heralded as transformative tools to deliver behavioral health interventions at scale, but few have been tested in rigorous randomized controlled trials. We tested the effect of a mobile app to increase vegetable consumption among overweight adults attempting weight loss maintenance. Methods: Overweight adults (n=135) aged 18‐50 years with BMI=28‐40 kg/m2 near Stanford, CA were recruited from an ongoing 12‐month weight loss trial (parent trial) and randomly assigned to either the stand‐alone, theory‐based Vegethon mobile app (enabling goal setting, self‐monitoring, and feedback and using "process motivators" including fun, surprise, choice, control, social comparison, and competition) or a wait‐listed control condition. The primary outcome was daily vegetables servings, measured by an adapted Harvard food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) 8 weeks post‐randomization. Daily vegetable servings from 24‐hour dietary recalls, administered by trained, certified, and blinded interviewers 5 weeks post‐randomization, was included as a secondary outcome. All analyses were conducted according to principles of intention‐to‐treat. Results: Daily vegetable consumption was significantly greater in the intervention versus control condition for both measures (adjusted mean difference: 2.0 servings; 95% CI: 0.1, 3.8, p=0.04 for FFQ; and 1.0 servings; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.9; p=0.02 for 24‐hour recalls). Baseline vegetable consumption was a significant moderator of intervention effects (p=0.002) in which effects increased as baseline consumption increased. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the efficacy of a mobile app to increase vegetable consumption among overweight adults. Theory‐based mobile interventions may present a low‐cost, scalable, and effective approach to improving dietary behaviors and preventing associated chronic diseases.

AB  - Since the 2012 Lancet Series on physical activity, progress regarding this topic has been negligible at global level. Thus, improving physical activity levels in specific populations through new methodologies is positioned as a priority. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a physical activity intervention on body fatness composition, and measured and self‐reported physical fitness components based on the use of a smartphone app. The investigation included 100 Spanish university students, cluster‐randomized into the smartphone app intervention group or a control group (n = 35 and n = 31 respectively, after applying exclusion criteria). The physical activity intervention comprised a 9‐week programme designed to promote a healthy physical activity pattern using a smartphone app. Specifically, an mHealth approach was taken containing five BCTs. The results showed that the intervention group improved their physical fitness (F = 8.1, p = .006) and reported better general scores in self‐reported physical fitness (F = 7.4, p = .008) over time, in comparison to the control group. However, the intervention group did not show any changes to their fatness. Further research is needed to disentangle which BCTs are more effective to achieve physical health improvements when using physical activity apps.

AB  - Introduction: Interventions that improve both physical activity and sleep quality may be more effective in improving overall health. The purpose of the Synergy Study is to test the efficacy of a mobile health combined behavior intervention targeting physical activity and sleep quality. Study design: Randomized, waitlist‐controlled trial. Setting/participants: This study had an app‐based delivery mode, Australia‐wide. The participants were 160 adults who reported insufficient physical activity and poor sleep quality in an eligibility survey. Intervention: The intervention was a mobile app providing educational resources, goal setting, self‐monitoring, and feedback strategies. It included 12 weeks of personalized support including weekly reports, tool sheets, and prompts. Main outcome measures: Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 months (primary), and 6 months (secondary endpoint). Self‐reported minutes of moderate‐to‐vigorous intensity physical activity and sleep quality were co‐primary outcomes. Resistance training; sitting time; sleep hygiene; sleep timing variability; insomnia severity; daytime sleepiness; quality of life; and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were secondary outcomes. Data were collected between June 2017 and February 2018 and analyzed in August 2018. Results: At 3 months, between‐group differences in moderate‐to‐vigorous intensity physical activity were not statistically significant (p=0.139). Significantly more participants in the intervention group engaged in â‰¥2 days/week (p=0.004) of resistance training. The intervention group reported better overall sleep quality (p=0.009), subjective sleep quality (p=0.017), sleep onset latency (p=0.013), waketime variability (p=0.018), sleep hygiene (p=0.027), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and lower stress symptoms (p=0.032) relative to waitlist controls. At 6 months, group differences were maintained for sleep hygiene (p=0.048), insomnia severity (p=0.002), and stress symptoms (p=0.006). Differences were observed for bedtime variability (p=0.023), sleepiness (p<0.001), daytime dysfunction (p=0.039), and anxiety symptoms (p=0.003) at 6 months, but not 3 months. Conclusions: This remotely delivered intervention did not produce statistically significant between‐group differences in minutes of moderate‐to‐vigorous intensity physical activity. Significant short‐term differences in resistance training and short‐ and medium‐term differences in sleep health in favor of the intervention were observed. Trial registration: This study is registered at anzctr.org.au ACTRN12617000376347.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) reduces upper extremity function and performance of everyday activities; however, there are few evidence‐based rehabilitation interventions. This study examined short and longer‐term effects of two occupational therapy interventions on hand disability. METHODS: Participants with diffuse cutaneous SSc were randomized to one of two 18‐week interventions: Intensive group, receiving 8‐weekly in‐person occupational therapy sessions with App‐delivered home exercises, or App alone group. The primary outcome was QuickDASH hand disability; secondary outcomes were physical function (PROMIS scale), and total active hand motion. Linear mixed models were used to examine treatment effects. RESULTS: Most participants were female (72%); the mean age was 52 years ± 13.4 (n = 32). There were no significant between‐group effects on QuickDASH (p = 1.0; mean change ‐6.4 on 0‐100 scale in both groups at 18 weeks). Left lateral pinch, an exploratory outcome, improved in App alone compared to Intensive from baseline to 18 weeks. Within groups, the intensive group had the largest improvements after 8 weeks (‐8.5 on QuickDASH; p = 0.03), but then lost gains from 8 to 18 weeks while the App alone group had modest improvements from baseline to 8 weeks, but then continued to improve. Of completers, 50% had clinically meaningful improvement on QuickDASH in the Intensive group and 64% had improvement in App alone. CONCLUSION: Both interventions showed beneficial effects on hand disability. Participants in the App alone group improved equally to the Intensive group at 18 weeks. Our findings provide support for further study into telehealth rehabilitation approaches.

AB  - The study aim was to implement and evaluate the feasibility of a culturally informed (“BeFAB”) app for African American/Black women to address postpartum weight. Women (n = 136; mean age = 27.8 ± 5.4; mean BMI = 32.5 ± 4.3) were recruited from postpartum units, and randomly assigned to receive BeFAB (n = 65) or usual care (n = 71) for 12 weeks. App content included didactic lessons delivered via a virtual coach, app‐based messages, goal setting and tracking, and edutain‐ment videos. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, retention and engagement, and self‐re‐ported acceptability. Behavioral (i.e., diet, physical activity), psychosocial (i.e., stress, coping, sup‐port, self‐efficacy) and weight outcomes were also examined. Recruitment goals were met, but attrition was high, with 56% retention at 12 weeks. Approximately half of participants accessed the app and set a goal >one time, but <10% reported achieving a nutrition or activity goal. Among study completers, >60% found the app content at least somewhat helpful. Within‐group changes for Be‐FAB among completers were found for increased moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity and decreased fruit/vegetable intake and weight. Findings indicate initial feasibility of recruiting postpartum women to participate in a digital healthy body weight program but limited use, reflecting low acceptability and challenges in engagement and retention. Future research is needed on strategies to engage and retain participants in postpartum interventions.

AB  - Background: People with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (CPMS) have limited options in medical treatment. Enhancing physical activity (PA) might promote neuroregeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) and positively influence disability, thus providing an alternative to medical treatment. Previous studies indicate that evidence‐based patient information (EBPI) is essential for inducing behavioral change, e.g. enhancing PA. Objective: To investigate feasibility of a smartphone app providing EBPI about the benefit of PA and a simple activity feedback to enhance PA in people with CPMS in a pilot randomized controlled trial over 3 months. Methods: Thirty‐eight people with CPMS (mean age 51 years, median Expanded Disability Status Scale 4.0) were 1:1 randomized into either a control group (n = 20) or an intervention group (n = 18). The intervention group received access to a multimedia EBPI app including activity feedback, texts, figures and videos. In the control group, participants received a leaflet with unspecific information about exercising in general. The EPBI itself was designed based on a systematic review. At baseline and after 3 months, all participants underwent clinical performance tests, filled in questionnaires and received an activity monitor (ActigraphÒ) for 7 days. The primary endpoint was the rate of responders defined as participants with a 20% increase of physical acitivity (time of moderate or vigiorous PA—MVPA) or 20% increase of the number of steps, both assessed with the activity monitor. As secondary endpoints, we compared accelerometry, performance and questionnaires adjusted for baseline measurments between the groups (ANCOVA). Moreover, we used questionnaires to compare knowledge about exercise (activity requiring physical effort, carried out to improve or improve health and fitness) in MS, usability of the app in general and motivation towards a more active lifestyle after 3 months in both groups. Results: The groups showed significant differences in disease duration and PA according to the Godin–Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire at baseline. After 3 months, we detected no difference in the rate of responders, which was an overall 22%. However, MVPA significantly increased in both groups (p < 0.001) and the intervention group tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle (Cohens D = 0.7, p = 0.09) as measured by the questionnaire. Reponses also showed, that participants appreciated the app but claimed a lack of interactivity as a shortcoming. Conclusion: Just providing information in a multimedia smartphone app did not enhance physical activitiy more than a simple leaflet in this small pilot trial in CPMS. However, the group of app users tended to have a higher motivation towards a more active lifestyle. Overall, the concept of a smartphone app to support an active lifestyle in MS is highly appreciated by participants.

AB  - Promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviors among college students is a priority in line with the World Health Organization (WHO) strategies to improve the health through engaging in physical activity (PA) and healthy dietary behaviors. Using mobile health (m-Health) applications (apps) as a part of public health intervention offer a significant potential improvement among college students. The objectives of this 12-weeks randomized control trial (RCT) were to improve PA, reduce the sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs), and increase water consumption using theory-based m-Health apps intervention among college students. Need assessment phase was conducted to determine the baseline PA, SSBs, water consumption, and other health related concerns between those in an intervention group and a control group. In intervention phase, only the intervention group was exposed to m-Health apps. Evaluation phase was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the intervention program. This intervention followed the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior (COM-B) framework and was guided by Social Cognitive Theory (SCT). Stastical analysis included descriptive statistics, dependent t-test, and independent t- test to determine the differences pre-to-post intervention within and between groups. Additionally repeated measure ANOVA were conducted to evaluate the improvement in PA and water intake through intervention period. A pearson correlation was run to determine the relationship between post-exercise self–efficacy scores and step counts among intervention group. Results show a mean body mass index (BMI) of participants was 22.87 kg/m^2 . Significant (p<0.05) post-intervention differences were increased PA (step counts), increased water consumption, decreased body weight, and improved exercise self-efficacy scores among intervention group. There were no significant intervention effects for SSBs consumption, SSBs self-efficacy scores, BMI, and percent body-fat. Regarding to control group, there was no significant differences pre-to-post intervention among all measures. There was a strong, positive correlation between post-exercise self–efficacy scores and week 12-step count among intervention group. In conclusion, the results from the current study demonstrates that a theory based12-weekRCT m-Health app intervention offer an effective way to significantly improve PA (step counts), body weight, and other dietary healthy lifestyle in college students. In the future, a larger RCT with longer follow-up are required to allow positive physiological changes to occur and to examine the sustainability of such improvement.

AB  - AbstractIntroduction: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is prevalent among college students. Smartphone‐based interventions may be a low‐cost treatment method. Method: College students with self‐reported GAD were randomized to receive smartphone‐based guided self‐help (n = 50), or no treatment (n = 50). Post‐treatment and six‐month follow‐up outcomes included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales‐Short Form Stress Subscale (DASS Stress), the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ‐11), and the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory‐Trait (STAI‐T), as well as diagnostic status assessed by the GAD‐Questionnaire, 4th edition. Results: From pre‐ to post‐treatment, participants who received guided self‐help (vs. no treatment) experienced significantly greater reductions on the DASS Stress (d = ‐0.408) and a greater probability of remission from GAD (d = ‐0.445). There was no significant between‐group difference in change on the PSWQ‐11 (d = ‐0.208) or STAI‐T (d = ‐0.114). From post to six‐month follow‐up there was no significant loss of gains on DASS Stress scores (d = ‐0.141) and of those who had remitted, 78.6% remained remitted. Yet rates of remitted participants no longer differed significantly between conditions at follow‐up (d = ‐0.229). Conclusion: Smartphone‐based interventions may be efficacious in treating some aspects of GAD. Methods for improving symptom reduction and long‐term outcome are discussed.

AB  - In 2008, Apple and Android launched their Application or "App" stores. Since then, there has been a growing interest in using mobile apps for improving medication adherence. However, research on the efficacy of apps, in terms of improved medication adherence and clinical outcome and/or patient-related outcome measures (PROMs) is scarce. The objective of this research was to systematically review the impact of apps on consumers' medication adherence and to determine the effect on clinical outcome and/or PROM(s). A systematic literature search was conducted to identify publications aimed at improving medication adherence published from January 2008 to April 2018. All studies were assessed for risk of bias using either the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions or the revised tool for Risk of Bias in randomized trials tool, depending on study design. Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 10 non-RCTs were included. All 11 RCTs showed improvements in adherence; however, only seven reported statistically significant improvements in at least one adherence measure. Nine RCTs also demonstrated improvements in clinical outcome/PROM(s), of which five were statistically significant, whereas two RCTs did not report on clinical outcome/PROM(s). Only two studies using non-RCT study designs showed statistically significant improvements in all measures of adherence and clinical outcome/PROM(s). The risk of bias was moderate or serious for all included studies. Even though the use of an app may improve adherence, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the impact of apps on medication adherence due to the high degree of heterogeneity across studies, from the methodological design to the features of the app and the measure of adherence.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile health (mHealth) application, based on self-regulation theory, on patients' knowledge of wound care, skills in changing dressings and anxiety. Design: A prospective randomized controlled trial. Methods: Seventy patients (or family members) at a 1,500-bed university hospital in Taiwan were randomized into an experimental (N = 35) or control group (N = 35) from March to December 2016. The experimental group used a mHealth application for wound care; the control group received verbal instructions and a booklet. Instruments to collect data were a wound care knowledge scale, wound care skills scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a digital heart variability device. Data were collected at baseline, after three additional demonstrations and before discharge. The generalized estimating equation was used for statistical analysis. Results: The experimental group showed significantly higher levels of wound care knowledge, improved wound care skills, lower levels of state anxiety, and lower heart rate variability than the control group after baseline data collection. Conclusions: Results support hat a mHealth application may be effective in health education. Clinicians can use the results to promote patients' wound care knowledge, enhance their wound care skills, and reduce anxiety related to dressing changes. Impact: Lack of wound care knowledge and skills can affect the willingness and ability to perform effective wound dressing changes, producing anxiety and having an impact on a patient's self-care after hospital discharge. mHealth applications (apps) have the potential to deliver health information in targeted and tailored ways that strengthen the self-management of diseases. mHealth app can increase wound care knowledge, improve care skills, and reduce anxiety related to wound care. mHealth app effectively supports self-monitoring of the wound healing process, self-judgement of the wound condition, and self-reaction of wound care accuracy. mHealth app provides step-by-step visual tutorials on wound care that allow patients and family caregivers to take pictures of the wounds and monitor the wound healing process. mHealth app for wound care knowledge is an effective and individualized method for learning.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Digital health technologies may be useful tools in the management of chronic diseases. We performed a systematic review of digital health interventions in the management of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and evaluated its impact on (i) disease activity monitoring, (ii) treatment adherence, (iii) quality of life (QoL) measures, and/or (iv) health care utilization. METHODS: Through a systematic review of multiple databases through August 31, 2020, we identified randomized controlled trials in patients with IBD comparing digital health technologies vs standard of care (SoC) for clinical management and monitoring and reporting impact on IBD disease activity, treatment adherence, QoL, and/or health care utilization or cost-effectiveness. We performed critical qualitative synthesis of the evidence supporting digital health interventions in patients with IBD and rated certainty of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS: Overall, we included 14 randomized controlled trials (median, 98 patients; range 34-909 patients; follow-up <12 months) that compared web-based interventions, mobile applications, and different telemedicine platforms with SoC (clinic-based encounters). Although overall disease activity and risk of relapse were comparable between digital health technologies and SoC (very low certainty of evidence), digital health interventions were associated with lower rate of health care utilization and health care costs (low certainty of evidence). Digital health interventions did not significantly improve patients' QoL and treatment adherence compared with SoC (very low certainty of evidence). Trials may have intrinsic selection bias due to nature of digital interventions. DISCUSSION: Digital health technologies may be effective in decreasing health care utilization and costs, though may not offer advantage in reducing risk of relapse, QoL, and improving treatment adherence in patients with IBD. These techniques may offer value-based care for population health management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The OL@‐OR@ mobile health programme was co‐designed with Māori and Pasifika communities in New Zealand, to support healthy lifestyle behaviours. We aimed to determine whether use of the programme improved adherence to health‐related guidelines among Māori and Pasifika communities in New Zealand compared with a control group on a waiting list for the programme. METHODS: The OL@‐OR@ trial was a 12‐week, two‐arm, cluster��randomised controlled trial. A cluster was defined as any distinct location or setting in New Zealand where people with shared interests or contexts congregated, such as churches, sports clubs, and community groups. Members of a cluster were eligible to participate if they were aged 18 years or older, had regular access to a mobile device or computer, and had regular internet access. Clusters of Māori and of Pasifika (separately) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the intervention or control condition. The intervention group received the OL@‐OR@ mHealth programme (smartphone app and website). The control group received a control version of the app that only collected baseline and outcome data. The primary outcome was self‐reported adherence to health‐related guidelines, which were measured with a composite health behaviour score (of physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, and fruit and vegetable intake) at 12 weeks. The secondary outcomes were self‐reported adherence to health‐related behaviour guidelines at 4 weeks; self‐reported bodyweight at 12 weeks; and holistic health and wellbeing status at 12 weeks, in all enrolled individuals in eligible clusters; and user engagement with the app, in individuals allocated to the intervention. Adverse events were not collected. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12617001484336. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24 and Aug 14, 2018, we enrolled 337 Māori participants from 19 clusters and 389 Pasifika participants from 18 clusters (n=726 participants) in the intervention group and 320 Māori participants from 15 clusters and 405 Pasifika participants from 17 clusters (n=725 participants) in the control group. Of these participants, 227 (67%) Māori participants and 347 (89%) Pasifika participants (n=574 participants) in the intervention group and 281 (88%) Māori participants and 369 (91%) Pasifika participants (n=650 participants) in the control group completed the 12‐week follow‐up and were included in the final analysis. Relative to baseline, adherence to health‐related behaviour guidelines increased at 12 weeks in both groups (315 [43%] of 726 participants at baseline to 329 [57%] of 574 participants in the intervention group; 331 [46%] of 725 participants to 369 [57%] of 650 participants in the control group); however, there was no significant difference between intervention and control groups in adherence at 12 weeks (odds ratio [OR] 1·13; 95% CI 0·84‐1·52; p=0·42). Furthermore, the proportion of participants adhering to guidelines on physical activity (351 [61%] of 574 intervention group participants vs 407 [63%] of 650 control group participants; OR 1·03, 95% CI 0·73‐1·45; p=0·88), smoking (434 [76%] participants vs 501 [77%] participants; 1·12, 0·67‐1·87; p=0·66), alcohol consumption (518 [90%] participants vs 596 [92%] participants; 0·73, 0·37‐1·44; p=0·36), and fruit and vegetable intake (194 [34%] participants vs 196 [30%] participants; 1·08, 0·79‐1·49; p=0·64) did not differ between groups. We found no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in any secondary outcome. 147 (26%) intervention group participants engaged with the OL@‐OR@ programme (ie, set at least one behaviour change goal online). INTERPRETATION: The OL@‐OR@ mobile health programme did not improve adherence to health‐related behaviour guidelines amongst Māori and Pasifika individuals.

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to design a Persian‐language application for celiac patients and assess its effectiveness on patients` knowledge and adherence to a gluten‐free diet (GFD). Methods: In the present randomized controlled clinical trial, 60 patients were randomly assigned to receive education through a smartphone application (n = 30) or conventional clinical education (n = 30). The primary outcomes were assessing knowledge about celiac disease and GFD, and adherence to GFD that were assessed at baseline and three months after interventions. The knowledge and adherence were assessed by a valid author‐designed knowledge questionnaire and the validated celiac disease adherence test (CDAT) respectively. Results: The mean disease duration was 4.38 ± 3.27 years. The mean post‐intervention score of knowledge about gluten‐free foods was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the placebo group after adjusting for baseline values and characteristics (p‐value = 0.03). There was a significant difference in post‐intervention CDAT values between the two groups (p‐value = 0.01). Conclusion: The smartphone application had a significant effect on celiac patients` knowledge about gluten‐free foods and adherence to GFD. Practice Implications: The smartphone applications can be designed according to each country's particular circumstances and can be suggested by nutritionists and physicians to use by celiac patients.

AB  - Although behavioral therapies are effective for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), access for patients is limited. Attention-bias modification (ABM), a cognitive-training intervention designed to reduce attention bias for threat, can be broadly disseminated using technology. We remotely tested an ABM mobile app for PTSD. Participants (N = 689) were randomly assigned to personalized ABM, nonpersonalized ABM, or placebo training. ABM was a modified dot-probe paradigm delivered daily for 12 sessions. Personalized ABM included words selected using a recommender algorithm. Placebo included only neutral words. Primary outcomes (PTSD and anxiety) and secondary outcomes (depression and PTSD clusters) were collected at baseline, after training, and at 5-week-follow-up. Mechanisms assessed during treatment were attention bias and self-reported threat sensitivity. No group differences emerged on outcomes or attention bias. Nonpersonalized ABM showed greater declines in self-reported threat sensitivity than placebo (p = .044). This study constitutes the largest mobile-based trial of ABM to date. Findings do not support the effectiveness of mobile ABM for PTSD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential benefit of eHealth interventions in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is uncertain. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an eHealth intervention on anxiety in patients with AAA undergoing surgery. METHODS: A single‐centre randomized clinical trial of patients with AAA scheduled for surgical repair was undertaken. The intervention group received an eHealth tool and psychosocial support besides standard care. The control group received standard care. The analysis of treatment effects was performed as intention‐to‐treat and per protocol analysis. The primary outcome measure was anxiety mean score (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety (HADS)‐A). Secondary outcomes measures were HADS Depression and short‐form 12‐item health survey mean scores. RESULTS: Some 120 participants were randomized. No effect on anxiety mean scores was found in the intention‐to‐treat analysis (‐1.21 versus ‐0.54, P = 0.330). Among those randomized to the intervention, only 30 of 60 participants used the eHealth tool (application (app) users). The app users were younger and had a higher educational level. A decrease in anxiety mean scores was noted in those who used the app in the per protocol analysis (‐2.00 versus ‐0.54, P = 0.028). The intervention group stated a lower physical‐component health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) (‐4.32 versus ‐1.16, P = 0.042) but mental‐component HRQoL and depressive symptoms were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery of an eHealth intervention in this RCT did not result in an improvement in anxiety scores in patients awaiting AAA surgery. Uptake of the eHealth tool was low, although it resulted in lower anxiety scores in those participants who actually used it.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe and assess digital health-led diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) effectiveness in improving glycosylated hemoglobin, diabetes knowledge, and health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of Type 1 and 2 Diabetes in the past 10 years. DESIGN: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO registration number CRD42019139884. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Scopus between January 2010 and August 2019. Study Selection and Appraisal: Randomized control trials of digital health-led DSMES for Type 1 (T1DM) or 2 (T2DM) diabetes compared to usual care were included. Outcomes were change in HbA1c, diabetes knowledge, and HrQoL. Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool was used to assess bias and GRADEpro for overall quality. The analysis involved narrative synthesis, subgroup and pooled meta-analyses. RESULTS: From 4286 articles, 39 studies (6861 participants) were included. Mean age was 51.62 years, range (13-70). Meta-analysis revealed intervention effects on HbA1c for T2DM with difference in means (MD) from baseline -0.480% (-0.661, -0.299), I275% (6 months), -0.457% (-0.761, -0.151), I2 81% (12 months), and for T1DM -0.41% (-1.022, 0.208) I2 83% (6 months), -0.03% (-0.210, 0.142) I2 0% (12 months). Few reported HrQoL with Hedges' g 0.183 (-0.039, 0.405), I2 0% (6 months), 0.153 (-0.060, 0.366), I2 0% (12 months) and diabetes knowledge with Hedges' g 1.003 (0.068, 1.938), I2 87% (3 months). CONCLUSION: Digital health-led DSMES are effective in improving HbA1c and diabetes knowledge, notably for T2DM. Research shows non-significant changes in HrQoL. Intervention effect on HbA1c was more impressive if delivered through mobile apps or patient portals. Further research is needed on the impact of DSMES on these outcomes, especially for newly diagnosed diabetes patients.

AB  - The current study examined the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of the mindfulness based mobile application (MBMA) Headspace on the perceived stress, psychological distress, mindfulness, and life satisfaction of undergraduate health science students after a brief, 10-15 day, intervention period. Participants included 66 undergraduate premedical and nursing students randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 33) or no treatment control group (n = 33). Data from a user satisfaction survey and participation indicated that those assigned to the intervention found the application both feasible and acceptable when compared to similar studies and other mindfulness-based interventions. Four one-way ANCOVAs were run across variables of interest to detect differences in post-test scores while controlling for pretest scores between the intervention and no treatment control groups. Results indicated a statistically significant decrease in perceived stress for the intervention group as compared to the no treatment control; however, no statistically significant differences were found on measures of psychological distress, mindfulness, and life satisfaction. Findings suggest the use of an MBMA may be viable as an acceptable and feasible method of introducing stress management strategies to premedical and nursing students. However, the minimal decreases in symptomology observed in the current study indicate that a more in-depth mindfulness intervention may be needed. More research is needed to better strike the balance between a feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness for mindfulness based interventions with premedical and nursing students.

AB  - Exacerbations of COPD are one of the commonest causes of admission and readmission to hospital. The role of digital interventions to support self‐management in improving outcomes is uncertain. We conducted an open, randomised controlled trial of a digital health platform application (app) in 41 COPD patients recruited following hospital admission with an acute exacerbation. Subjects were randomised to either receive usual care, including a written self‐management plan (n = 21), or the myCOPD app (n = 20) for 90 days. The primary efficacy outcome was recovery rate of symptoms measured by COPD assessment test (CAT) score. Exacerbations, readmission, inhaler technique quality of life and patient activation (PAM) scores were also captured by a blinded team. The app was acceptable in this care setting and was used by 17 of the 20 patients with sustained use over the study period. The treatment effect on the CAT score was 4.49 (95% CI: −8.41, −0.58) points lower in the myCOPD arm. Patients’ inhaler technique improved in the digital intervention arm (101 improving to 20 critical errors) compared to usual care (100 to 72 critical errors). Exacerbations tended to be less frequent in the digital arm compared to usual care; 34 vs 18 events. Hospital readmissions risk was numerically lower in the digital intervention arm: OR for readmission 0.383 (95% CI: 0.074, 1.987; n = 35). In this feasibility study of the digital self‐management platform myCOPD, the app has proven acceptable to patients to use and use has improved exacerbation recovery rates, with strong signals of lower re‐exacerbation and readmission rates over 90 days. myCOPD reduced the number of critical errors in inhaler technique compared to usual care with written self‐management. This provides a strong basis for further exploration of the use of app interventions in the context of recently hospitalised patients with COPD and informs the potential design of a large multi‐centre trial.

AB  - There is a major public health need for innovative and efficacious behavioral and cognitive interventions for smoking cessation. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of an acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) smartphone application in augmenting ACT group treatment for smoking cessation. One hundred fifty adults smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day were randomly assigned to 6 weekly group sessions of behavioral support, ACT, or ACT combined with the smartphone application. Access to the app was provided from the start of the in‐person treatment until the 6‐month follow‐up assessment. Participants were encouraged to make their quit attempts after the third session, and the posttreatment assessment occurred 3 weeks later. Measures of smoking status and ACT processes were obtained at baseline, posttreatment, and 6‐month follow‐up. Biochemically verified quit rates in the combined, ACT, and behavioral support groups were 36% (p = .079 relative to ACT; p = .193 relative to behavioral support), 20% (p = .630 relative to behavioral support) and 24% at posttreatment, as compared with 24% (p = .630 relative to behavioral support), 24% (p = .630 relative to behavioral support) and 20% at follow‐up. There was no significant difference (p = > .999) in the primary outcome of biochemically verified 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence at 6‐month follow‐up between the combined and ACT groups. The combined group reported significantly greater smoking reduction, acceptance and present‐moment awareness than the behavioral support group at posttreatment, but not at follow‐up. There were no significant differences between the groups in positive mental health. Contrary to hypotheses, the ACT group did not display significant improvements in positive mental health or ACT processes relative to the behavioral support group at posttreatment or follow‐up. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myofunctional therapy has demonstrated efficacy in treating sleep‐disordered breathing. We assessed the clinical use of a new mobile health (mHealth) app that uses a smartphone to teach patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea‐hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) to perform oropharyngeal exercises. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the effects of the app in patients with severe OSAHS. METHODS: Forty patients with severe OSAHS (apnea‐hypoxia index [AHI]>30) were enrolled prospectively and randomized into an intervention group that used the app for 90 sessions or a control group. Anthropometric measures, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (0‐24), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (0‐21), Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) scores, and oxygen desaturation index were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, 28 patients remained. No significant changes were observed in the control group; however, the intervention group showed significant improvements in most metrics. AHI decreased by 53.4% from 44.7 (range 33.8‐55.6) to 20.88 (14.02‐27.7) events/hour (P<.001). The oxygen desaturation index decreased by 46.5% from 36.31 (27.19‐43.43) to 19.4 (12.9‐25.98) events/hour (P=.003). The IOPI maximum tongue score increased from 39.83 (35.32‐45.2) to 59.06 (54.74‐64.00) kPa (P<.001), and the IOPI maximum lip score increased from 27.89 (24.16‐32.47) to 44.11 (39.5‐48.8) kPa (P<.001). The AHI correlated significantly with IOPI tongue and lip improvements (Pearson correlation coefficient ‐0.56 and ‐0.46, respectively; both P<.001). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale score decreased from 10.33 (8.71‐12.24) to 5.37 (3.45‐7.28) in the app group (P<.001), but the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Orofacial exercises performed using an mHealth app reduced OSAHS severity and symptoms, and represent a promising treatment for OSAHS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone‐based interventions are a potentially effective way to minimize alcohol‐related harm in young adult, non‐dependent drinkers. This pilot study is the first to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of a personalized alcohol harm‐minimization intervention delivered via smartphones. METHODS: Within a single‐blind, randomized controlled design, 45 young adults were randomly assigned to either the intervention app (n = 25; 18 females; Mage = 21.36 years, SDage = 4.15 years) or the control app (n = 20; 18 females; Mage = 22.75; SDage = 4.41). The two primary outcomes were frequency of risky drinking and drinking‐related harms, and the secondary outcome was frequency of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) use. All outcomes were measured at baseline and immediately post‐intervention. Using the Enlight framework [1], usability was evaluated via structured one‐on‐one phone interviews with a subgroup of six participants from the intervention group (3 females; Mage = 19.5 years, SDage = 1.64). RESULTS: There was no significant reduction in the primary outcomes from baseline to post‐intervention across the groups. For the secondary outcome, the application of PBS within drinking contexts increased at follow‐up for those in the intervention group but not for control participants. End‐users rated the app as highly usable but had some concerns with repetition of the app‐recommended strategies. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention, designed to reduce risky drinking behaviors among young adults, was rated as highly usable and was shown to increase the application of harm minimization strategies within drinking contexts. While the intervention and its delivery show promise, it did not appear to mitigate risky drinking behaviors. Implications of this research and future directions are discussed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: BLINDED.

AB  - Background: Diabetes is a chronic condition that requires constant self‐management. As a consequence, several software platforms have been developed to facilitate the tracking of diabetes data to improve diabetes management. Our aim was to determine the real‐world glycemic benefits of a mobile diabetes management platform used by individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Mobile platform‐using (n = 899) and control (n = 900) participants meeting specific minimum data criteria were randomly selected from a database of diabetes users. All results were modeled using different mixed effect generalized linear models, assigning random intercepts for each user, and adjusting the distribution assumption for each outcome. Results: Users of the mobile platform increased their frequency of blood glucose monitoring (+8.8 tests per month, 95% CI [3.4, 14.1], P <.001) and had fewer hyperglycemic events and lower average glucose levels compared to the control group. In addition, a mobile user could expect a 3.5% drop in average BG (‐6.4 mg/dL, 95% CI [‐2.0, ‐10.7], P <.001) and a 10.7% decrease in hyperglycemia (P <.001) after 2 months. Conclusion: Users of the mobile platform tested their BG more often and demonstrated greater improvement in blood glucose compared to users who did not use the mobile platform. This supports previous studies indicating that digital technologies can enhance diabetes care in a real‐world setting. Copyright © 2017, Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Poor health behaviors are prevalent in shift‐workers, but few multiple health‐behavior interventions consider their unique needs. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an existing app‐based intervention to improve physical activity, diet, and sleep quality in a shift‐worker population, (2) estimate intervention effect in a four‐week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) (ACTRN12618001785291). Shift‐workers (18‐65 years old) were randomized to intervention (n = 20) or wait‐list (n = 20) groups. Outcomes included recruitment, engagement, attrition, usefulness ratings, System Usability Scale (SUS), qualitative interviews, and estimation of treatment effect (minutes of physical activity, diet quality, and sleep quality) using mixed model analysis. Recruitment took one week. App‐use at week four was 55% (11/20), 85% (34/40) completed the four‐week follow‐up questionnaire, and 20% (4/20) of the intervention group completed the qualitative interview. The intervention was rated as slightly to moderately useful by 76.9% (10/13) of participants on a five‐point scale. The SUS score was 62.7 (12.7) out of 100. Diet quality improved for the intervention (4.5 points; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.1, 8.9; p = 0.047) vs. the wait‐list group, but not physical activity or sleep quality. Qualitative interviews found that a more tailored intervention, more accessible information, and interactive features were desired. The intervention was feasible in terms of recruitment, but modifications to increase engagement are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We explored whether newly developed application (Smartphone‐based brain Anti‐aging and memory Reinforcement Training, SMART) improved memory performance in older adults with subjective memory complaints (SMC). METHOD: A total of 53 adults (range: 50‐68 years; 52.8% female) were randomized into either one of two intervention groups [SMART (n = 18) vs. Fit Brains® (n = 19)] or a wait‐list group (n = 16). Participants in the intervention groups underwent 15‐20 minutes of training per day, five days per week for 8 weeks. We used objective cognitive measures to evaluate changes with respect to four domains: attention, memory, working memory (WM), and response inhibition. In addition, we included self‐report questionnaires to assess levels of SMC, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: Total WM quotient [t(17) = 6.27, p < .001] as well as auditory‐verbal WM score [t(17) = 4.45, p < .001] increased significantly in the SMART group but not in the control groups. Self‐reports of memory contentment, however, increased in the Fit Brains® group only [t(18) = 2.12, p < .05). CONCLUSION: Use of an 8‐week smartphone‐based memory training program may improve WM function in older adults. However, objective improvement in performance does not necessarily lead to decreased SMC.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well‐established treatment for panic disorder, but many fewer patients receive this treatment compared to medication‐based therapy. Mobile app‐based interactive CBT using a chatbot can increase patient access to CBT. We performed a preliminary study to determine whether short‐term use of a newly developed chatbot is feasible and effective for relieving panic symptoms. Method: Forty‐one patients were randomly assigned to either a chatbot group (n = 21) or control group (n = 20) for a period of 4 weeks. The chatbot group was guided in the use of the chatbot application, while the control group was provided with a book on panic disorder. Main results: The severity of panic disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group, but not in the control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and the control helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group compared to the control group. Discussion and conclusion: We found that mobile app‐based interactive CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective for reducing the severity of panic symptoms. Using this novel approach to provide CBT would allow clinicians to effect positive therapeutic outcomes with easy accessibility, interactivity, and self‐management for patients with panic symptoms.

AB  - Importance: According to the stepped‐care model, there is a medium to large effect size for using cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia that is delivered digitally, such as a smartphone application. However, it has been reported that studies using fully automated cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia applications without expert support have high dropout rates. Objective: To examine the effects of using a fully automated and individually tailored brief behavior therapy for insomnia (BBTI) applications for 2 weeks on insomnia‐related symptoms, social disabilities, and work productivity among workers with insomnia in Japan. Design, Setting, and Participants: This intent‐to‐treat prospective parallel‐group randomized clinical trial included participants 20 years or older with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores of 8 or higher. Participants were recruited via internet advertisements and workplace flyers and randomized to tailored BBTI, standard BBTI, self‐monitoring with sleep diaries, or a waiting list control group. The study was conducted from September 21, 2017, to February 23, 2018. Data were analyzed from February 24, 2018, to February 22, 2019. Interventions: A personalized BBTI and standard BBTI intervention, both of which included sleep scheduling, relaxation, sleep hygiene, and sleep diaries, administered via smartphone application. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were insomnia severity, measured using the Japanese version of the Insomnia Severity Index, and social disabilities, measured using the Japanese version of the Sheehan Disability Scale. Secondary outcomes were dysfunctional beliefs, sleep reactivity, and work productivity. All measures were taken before and after the intervention and at 1‐month and 3‐month follow‐ups. Results: A total of 92 participants (mean [SD] age, 42.7 [11.5] years; 60 [65%] men) were randomized and included in analysis, with 24 participants assigned to tailored BBTI, 23 participants assigned to standard BBTI, 23 participants assigned to self‐monitoring, and 22 participants assigned to the waiting list control group. At baseline, there were no significant differences among groups on any demographic characteristics or outcome measures. The results of the intent‐to‐treat analysis showed an interaction effect for all outcome measures. Compared with the waiting list control group, the BBTI interventions were more effective for reduction of insomnia severity (tailored BBTI: Hedges g = ‐1.64 [95% CI, ‐2.32 to ‐0.96]; P <.001; standard BBTI: g = ‐1.28 [95% CI, ‐1.93 to ‐0.63]; P <.001), social disabilities relating to social life (tailored BBTI: g = ‐1.33 [95% CI, ‐1.97 to ‐0.68]; P <.001; standard BBTI: g = ‐0.84 [95% CI, ‐1.46 to ‐0.22]; P =.009), and dysfunctional beliefs (tailored BBTI: g = ‐1.17 [95% CI, ‐1.80 to ‐0.54]; P <.001; standard BBTI: g = ‐0.84 [95% CI, ‐1.46 to ‐0.23]; P =.02) at the 3‐month follow‐up. Tailored BBTI quickly reduced insomnia severity (1‐month follow‐up: g = ‐0.85 [95% CI, ‐1.46 to ‐0.24]). Tailored BBTI was only more effective for improvement of work performance (g = ‐1.09 [95% CI, ‐1.71 to ‐0.46]; P =.005), social disabilities related to family life (g = ‐0.89 [95% CI, ‐1.51 to ‐0.28]; P =.005), and sleep reactivity (g = ‐1.09 [95% CI, ‐1.72 to ‐0.46]; P =.007) compared with the waiting list control group at the 3‐month follow‐up. The tailored BBTI led to improved worker productivity compared with standard BBTI (g = 0.94 [95% CI, 0.33 to 1.55]; P =.01) at the 3‐month follow‐up. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that an application for individually tailored BBTI is an inexpensive and effective treatment for insomnia. In future research, it would be informative to investigate the reasons for dropout during the follow‐up period. Trial Registration: umin.ac.jp/ctr Identifier: UMIN000036572.

AB  - Serious mental health disorders are increasing among college students and university counseling services are often overburdened. Mobile applications for mental health have been growing exponentially in the last decade and they are emerging in university settings as a promising tool to promote and intervene in college students' mental health. Additionally, considering the recent covid-19 pandemic, mHealth interventions, due to its nature and possibilities, may play an important role in these institutions. Our main objectives are to explore mhealth interventions in universities, regarding its conceptual framework, acceptability and efficacy outcomes and understand its impact and contributions to address treatment delivery and psychological difficulties resulting from covid-19 pandemic. The literature search was conducted in scientific databases, namely, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus. A search in app stores was not conducted, thus regarding commercially available apps, only those found in our database search were included in our review. We selected studies with mobile applications addressing psychological interventions for college students. A total of 2,158 participants were included in the 8 selected studies and most interventions were delivered through mobile apps only and based in cognitive behavioral therapy. Results suggested that college students accept and adhere to these interventions and preliminary evidence of efficacy was demonstrated in different disorders, such as stress, anxiety, depression and risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco abuse and sexual knowledge. We conclude that universities, particularly college counseling services, may benefit from mhealth interventions, not only to address college students' mental health but to decrease some of its difficulties related to lack of human resources. Specifically in covid-19 pandemic context, these interventions may contribute significantly by promoting and delivering psychological interventions at a safe distance.

AB  - Background and objectives Patients with CKD are at risk for adverse drug reactions, but effective community‐based preventive programs remain elusive. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of two digital applications designed to improve outpatient medication safety. Design, setting, participants, & measurements In a 1‐year randomized controlled trial, 182 outpatients with advanced CKD were randomly assigned to receive a smartphone preloaded with either eKidneyCare (n=89) or MyMedRec (n=93). The experimental intervention, eKidneyCare, includes a medication feature that prompted patients to review medications monthly and report changes, additions, or medication problems to clinicians for reconciliation and early intervention. The active comparator was MyMedRec, a commercially available, standalone application for storing medication and other health information that can be shared with patients’ providers. The primary outcome was the rate of medication discrepancy, defined as differences between the patient’s reported history and the clinic’s medication record, at exit. Results At exit, the eKidneyCare group had fewer total medication discrepancies compared with MyMedRec (median, 0.45; interquartile range, 0.33–0.63 versus 0.67; interquartile range, 0.40–1.00; P=0.001), and the change from baseline was 0.13±0.27 in eKidneyCare and 0.30±0.41 in MyMedRec (P=0.007). eKidneyCare use also reduced the severity of clinically relevant medication discrepancies in all categories, including those with the potential to cause serious harm (estimated rate ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.63). Usage data revealed that 72% of patients randomized to eKidneyCare completed one or more medication reviews per month, whereas only 30% of patients in the MyMedRec group (adjusted for dropouts) kept their medication profile on their phone. Conclusions In patients who are high risk and have CKD, eKidneyCare significantly reduced the rate and severity of medication discrepancies, the proximal cause of medication errors, compared with the active comparator.

AB  - Background: Technological surrogate nursing (TSN) derives from the idea that nurse‐caregiver substitutes can be created by technology to support chronic disease self‐care. Objective: This paper begins by arguing that TSN is a useful and viable approach to chronic disease self‐care. The analysis then focuses on the empirical research question of testing and demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of prototype TSN supplied to patients with the typical complex chronic disease of coexisting type 2 diabetes and hypertension. At the policy level, it is shown that the data allow for a calibration of TSN technology augmentation, which can be readily applied to health care management. Methods: A 24‐week, parallel‐group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed and implemented among diabetic and hypertensive outpatients in two Hong Kong public hospitals. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group, supplied with a tablet‐based TSN app prototype, or to a conventional self‐managing control group. Primary indices—hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure—and secondary indices were measured at baseline and at 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks after initiation, after which the data were applied to test TSN effectiveness and safety. Results: A total of 299 participating patients were randomized to the intervention group (n=151) or the control group (n=148). Statistically significant outcomes that directly indicated TSN effectiveness in terms of hemoglobin 1c were found in both groups but not with regard to systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These findings also offered indirect empirical support for TSN safety. Statistically significant comparative changes in these primary indices were not observed between the groups but were suggestive of an operational calibration of TSN technology augmentation. Statistically significant changes in secondary indices were obtained in one or both groups, but not between the groups. Conclusions: The RCT’s strong behavioral basis, as well as the importance of safety and effectiveness when complex chronic illness is proximately self‐managed by layperson patients, prompted the formulation of the empirical joint hypothesis that TSN would improve patient self‐care while satisfying the condition of patient self‐safety. Statistical and decision analysis applied to the experimental outcomes offered support for this hypothesis. Policy relevance of the research is demonstrated by the derivation of a data‐grounded operational calibration of TSN technology augmentation with ready application to health care management.

AB  - Background Evidence accumulates that an active lifestyle positively influences cancer treatment outcome. However, cancer patients experience difficulties in remaining physically active. A 'smartphone application' (app) such as ‘RunKeeper’, to self-monitoring physical activities (PA) might be an accessible solution. However, the improvement in PA caused by the use of RunKeeper still has to be determined. Objective To determine the improvement in self-reported PA caused by the RunKeeper app use in a 12-week follow-up. Secondary, the usability and patients’ experiences were explored. Methods A single center, randomized controlled feasibility design was used in Groningen, The Netherlands. Adult patients diagnosed with cancer were recruited and randomized in ‘Group A’, usual care or ‘Group B’, RunKeeper group, who were instructed to self-monitor PA. The improvement in PA was measured by the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) at baseline, 6 weeks (T1) and post-intervention (T2). Usability and patients’ experiences were explored at post-intervention. Results In total, (N=32) patients agreed to participate of which (N=24) were included in this preliminary analysis. At T1, an increase in PASE Sum Score and Total Minutes of PA was found in Group B, M= 42.3 (SDp= 31.7; d= .57, r= .27; 95% CI= -23.5-107.9; P= .19) and, M= 1186.3 (SDp= 580.1; d= .87, r= .4; 95% CI= -16.8-2389.3; P= .053) respectively. However, these results were not sustained at T2. Usability was rated by (N=6) patients, M= 78.75 (SD= 15.9; 95% CI= 62.1-95.4). Conclusions Self-monitoring PA with RunKeeper might be safe and feasible in cancer patients with medium to small effect-sizes. The usability is rated as good, empowered by promising positive patients’ experiences. The use of RunKeeper may be of clinical interest as a low-threshold tool to stimulate PA in cancer patients in a home-based setting.

AB  - PURPOSE: Evidence accumulates that an active lifestyle positively influences cancer treatment outcome. A "smartphone application" (app) such as "RunKeeper," to self‐monitor physical activity (PA) might be helpful. This study aimed to examine whether using RunKeeper to increase self‐reported PA is feasible in cancer patients and to evaluate patients' opinion about using RunKeeper in a 12‐week program. METHODS: Adult patients (n = 32), diagnosed with cancer, were randomized between usual care (n = 16) or a 12‐week intervention with instructions to self‐monitor PA with RunKeeper (n = 16). Changes in PA were determined with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) at baseline (T0), 6 weeks (T1), and 12 weeks (T2). Usability and patients' experiences were tested at T2 with the System Usability Scale (SUS) and a semi‐structured interview. RESULTS: Patient mean age was 33.6 years. Between T0 and T1, an increase in PA of 51% (medium estimated effect size r = 0.40) was found in PASE sum score in the intervention group compared with usual care. In addition, total minutes of PA increased with 46% (r = 0.37). These effects decreased over time (T2). Sedentary time decreased with 19% between T0 and T1 and 27% between T0 and T2. Usability was rated "good" and most patients found RunKeeper use helpful to improve PA. CONCLUSIONS: Self‐monitoring PA with RunKeeper was safe and feasible in cancer patients. The RunKeeper use resulted in an increase in PA after 6 weeks. RunKeeper usability was rated good and can be used to study PA in cancer patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02391454.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of a mindfulness‐based mobile application versus an in‐person mindfulness‐based training program in terms of reducing anxiety and increasing empathy, self‐compassion, and mindfulness in a population of healthcare students. METHODS: The authors conducted a single‐blind, randomised controlled trial with three parallel groups. Participants were allocated to the mobile app, the in‐person mindfulness‐based program (IMBP), or a control group. Assessments at baseline and postintervention (8 weeks) included measures of anxiety, empathy, self‐compassion, and mindfulness. RESULTS: Of 168 students randomised, 84 were analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis (app: n = 31; IMBP: n = 23; control: n = 30). The mobile app group showed a large effect size for reductions in trait anxiety compared with controls (g = 0.85, p = 0.003), and a medium, nonsignificant effect compared with the IMBP group (g = 0.52, p = 0.152). Participants from both interventions experienced a significant increase in self‐compassion and mindfulness compared with controls. Levels of empathy remained unchanged for the 3 arms. CONCLUSIONS: A mobile app can be as effective as an IMBP in reducing anxiety and increasing self‐compassion and mindfulness among healthcare students.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the impact of medPlan®, a medication reminder mobile application in glaucoma patients in Benin City, Nigeria. Methods: In a randomized control trial with 2 months follow‐up period, 200 patients receiving drug therapy for glaucoma were randomized into either into a control or study group. The study group comprised participants who made use of a medication reminder mobile application, medPlan®, while the control group consisted of those patients who did not use the application. Adherence to medication was measured for all the patients in both groups. Data was collected using a carefully designed questionnaire and statistically analyzed. Results: This study recorded 100 % response rate from the participants. In the study group, 56 % were very adherent while 18 % were moderately adherent, and 26 % were non‐adherent respondents as against 45 % very adherent, 13 % moderately adherent and 42 % non‐adherent respondents from the control group. In addition, 78 % of those in the study group agreed that there was improvement in their medication adherence since they started using the medication reminder application. This showed a significant positive impact of the medication reminder application (p = 0.0110) on adherence to medication. Conclusion: Medication adherence was improved in glaucoma patients who used medPlan®, a smartphone medication reminder application. This study lays a foundation for further research on medication reminder mobile applications.

AB  - Objective: The My Guide smartphone application was developed to improve quality of life and symptom burden (primary outcomes) for Latina breast cancer survivors (BCS) and tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial compared to an attention‐control condition (My Health smartphone application). This secondary analysis examined effects on breast cancer knowledge, coping, and cancer‐related self‐efficacy (intervention targets).Method: Latina BCS (N = 78) were randomized to My Guide or My Health for six weeks. Linear mixed‐effects modeling evaluated the effects of time and study condition on the intervention targets. Effects by engagement were explored. Results: Both conditions showed improved breast cancer knowledge (p < 0.001), with a trend for greatest improvement among My Guide high users (p = 0.082). My Guide participants reported less self‐blame overall than My Health participants (p = 0.020). There were no effects on cancer‐related self‐efficacy (ps > 0.05). Conclusion: Culturally‐informed smartphone applications may enhance breast cancer knowledge and promote adaptive coping among Latina BCS.

AB  - Suicide is a global public health problem and effective psychological interventions are needed. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an app‐assisted suicide prevention treatment on suicide risk and depression. One hundred twenty‐nine participants were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU), consisting of psychotherapy adhering to the framework of Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS), with (TAU + APP, N = 60) or without (TAU, N = 69) access to a mobile application (i.e., LifeApp'tite). Suicide risk and symptoms of depression were assessed pre‐ and posttherapy, and at 4‐month follow‐up. The TAU + APP group showed a smaller decrease on self‐reported suicide risk at the end of treatment, corresponding to a medium between‐group effect size (p =.008, d = 0.46). At the 4‐month follow‐up this was the case only at the trend level, where the effect size was also of a smaller magnitude (p =.057, d = 0.30). No differences between the treatment groups were observed on self‐reported depressive symptoms, either immediately following treatment (p =.732, d = 0.05) or at follow‐up (p =.467, d = 0.11). The unexpected negative effect concerning suicide risk points to crucial consideration of issues pertaining to timing, dosing, and content when adding new technology to existing treatments both in this and other populations.

AB  - Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (PTSS) are common after minor injuries and can impair recovery. We sought to understand whether an evidence‐based mobile phone application with self‐help tools (PTSD Coach) could be useful to improve recovery after acute trauma among injured emergency department (ED) patients. This pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and potential benefit of using PTSD Coach among acutely injured motor vehicle crash (MVC) patients. Methods: From September 2017 to September 2018, we recruited adult patients within 24Â hours post‐MVC from the EDs of two Level I trauma centers in the United States. We randomly assigned 64 injured adults to either the PTSD Coach (nÂ =Â 33) or treatment as usual (TAU; nÂ =Â 31) condition. We assessed PTSS and associated symptoms at 1Â month (83% retained) and 3Â months (73% retained) postenrollment. Results: Enrollment was feasible (74% of eligible subjects participated) but usability and engagement were low (67% used PTSD Coach at least once, primarily in week 1); 76% of those who used it rated the app as moderately to extremely helpful. No differences emerged between groups in PTSS outcomes. Exploratory analyses among black subjects (nÂ =Â 21) indicated that those in the PTSD Coach condition (vs. TAU) reported marginally lower PTSS (95% CIÂ =Â âˆ’0.30 to 37.77) and higher PTSS coping self‐efficacy (95% CIÂ =Â âˆ’58.20 to âˆ’3.61) at 3 months. Conclusions: We demonstrated feasibility to recruit acutely injured ED patients into an app‐based intervention study, yet mixed evidence emerged for the usability and benefit of PTSD Coach. Most patients used the app once and rated it favorably in regard to satisfaction with and helpfulness, but longitudinal engagement was low. This latter finding may explain the lack of overall effects on PTSS. Additional research is warranted regarding whether targeting more symptomatic patients and the addition of engagement and support features can improve efficacy.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a smartphone application‐based dietary self‐management program for haemodialysis patients and to examine its effects on biochemical indicators, self‐efficacy and quality of life. BACKGROUND: Lack of dietary management in haemodialysis patients can lead to serious complications such as oedema, hyponatremia, hyperkalaemia, hypertension, uraemia and eventually death; however, studies using smartphone applications for dietary self‐management in haemodialysis patients are rare. DESIGN: A prospective, single‐blind, randomised, controlled design with repeated measures was followed with 75 haemodialysis patients at a haemodialysis centre. Data were collected from 10 January 2017‐6 May 2018. The study applied the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. METHODS: The 8‐week smartphone application‐based dietary self‐management program was developed through collaboration with a haemodialysis equipment company. The experimental group took this program while the control group took an 8‐week general program. Study variables were serum phosphorus, potassium and albumin, self‐efficacy and quality of life. They were measured at pretest, and 8 weeks and 12 weeks after the programs, and analysed using two‐way repeated measures analysis of variance. FINDINGS: The smartphone application‐based program significantly improved serum phosphorus, potassium, self‐efficacy and quality of life over time compared with the general program. There was no significant difference in albumin level changes between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The smartphone application‐based dietary self‐management program is an opportune and effective nursing intervention to lower serum phosphorus and potassium levels in haemodialysis patients over time. Trial registration was performed on www.cris.nih.go.kr (KCT0005366). RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Haemodialysis patients can easily use the smartphone application to manage their diet anytime and anywhere. They can get real‐time feedback and solutions to prevent haemodialysis complications. Nurses can provide tailored high‐quality care based on an individual's lifelog data from the smartphone application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although calorie tracking is one of the strongest predictors of weight loss in behavioral weight loss interventions, low rates of adherence are common. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using the Slip Buddy app during a 12‐week web‐based weight loss program. METHODS: We conducted a randomized pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using the Slip Buddy app compared with a popular commercial calorie tracking app during a counselor‐led, web‐based behavioral weight loss intervention. Adults who were overweight or obese were recruited on the web and randomized into a 12‐week web‐based weight loss intervention that included either the Slip Buddy app or a commercial calorie tracking app. Feasibility outcomes included retention, app use, usability, slips reported, and contextual factors reported at slips. Acceptability outcomes included ratings of how helpful, tedious, taxing, time consuming, and burdensome using the assigned app was. We described weight change from baseline to 12 weeks in both groups as an exploratory outcome. Participants using the Slip Buddy app provided feedback on how to improve it during the postintervention focus groups. RESULTS: A total of 75% (48/64) of the participants were female and, on average, 39.8 (SD 11.0) years old with a mean BMI of 34.2 (SD 4.9) kg/m2. Retention was high in both conditions, with 97% (31/32) retained in the Slip Buddy condition and 94% (30/32) retained in the calorie tracking condition. On average, participants used the Slip Buddy app on 53.8% (SD 31.3%) of days, which was not significantly different from those using the calorie tracking app (mean 57.5%, SD 28.4% of days), and participants who recorded slips (30/32, 94%) logged on average 17.9 (SD 14.4) slips in 12 weeks. The most common slips occurred during snack times (220/538, 40.9%). Slips most often occurred at home (297/538, 55.2%), while working (153/538, 28.4%), while socializing (130/538, 24.2%), or during screen time (123/538, 22.9%). The conditions did not differ in participants' ratings of how their assigned app was tedious, taxing, or time consuming (all values of P>.05), but the calorie tracking condition gave their app higher helpfulness and usability ratings (all values of P<.05). Technical issues were the most common type of negative feedback, whereas simplicity was the most common type of positive feedback. Weight losses of ≥5% of baseline weight were achieved by 31% (10/32) of Slip Buddy participants and 34% (11/32) of calorie tracking participants. CONCLUSIONS: Self‐monitoring of dietary lapses and the contextual factors associated with them may be an alternative for people who do not prefer calorie tracking. Future research should examine patient characteristics associated with adherence to different forms of dietary self‐monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To pilot test the effectiveness of "MyNutriCart", a smartphone application (app) that generates healthy grocery lists, on diet and weight. METHODS: A pilot randomized trial was conducted to test the efficacy of using the "MyNutriCart" app compared to one face‐to‐face counseling session (Traditional group) in Hispanic overweight and obese adults. Household food purchasing behavior, three 24‐h food recalls, Tucker's semi‐quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and weight were assessed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Statistical analyses included t tests, a Poisson regression model, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using STATA. RESULTS: 24 participants in the Traditional group and 27 in the App group completed the study. Most participants were women (>88%), with a mean age of 35.3 years, more than a high school education (>80%), a family composition of at least three members, and a mean baseline body mass index (BMI) of 34.5 kg/m². There were significant improvements in household purchasing of vegetables and whole grains, in individual intakes of refined grains, healthy proteins, whole‐fat dairies, legumes, 100% fruit juices, and sweets and snacks; and in the individual frequency of intake of fruits and cold cuts/cured meats within the intervention group (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found between groups. No changes were detected in weight. CONCLUSIONS: "MyNutriCart" app use led to significant improvements in food‐related behaviors compared to baseline, with no significant differences when compared to the Traditional group. Cost and resource savings of using the app compared to face‐to‐face counseling may make it a good option for interventionists.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions are intended to support complex health care needs in chronic diseases digitally, but they are mainly targeted at general health improvement and neglect disease‐specific requirements. Therefore, we designed TrackPAD, a smartphone app to support supervised exercise training in patients with peripheral arterial disease. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study aimed to evaluate changes in the 6‐minute walking distance (meters) as a primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures included changes in physical activity and assessing the patients' peripheral arterial disease‐related quality of life. METHODS: This was a pilot two‐arm, single‐blinded, randomized controlled trial. Patients with symptomatic PAD (Fontaine stage IIa/b) and access to smartphones were eligible. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to the study, with the control group stratified by the distance covered in the 6‐minute walking test using the TENALEA software. Participants randomized to the intervention group received usual care and the mobile intervention (TrackPAD) for the follow‐up period of 3 months, whereas participants randomized to the control group received routine care only. TrackPAD records the frequency and duration of training sessions and pain levels using manual user input. Clinical outcome data were collected at the baseline and after 3 months via validated tools (the 6‐minute walk test and self‐reported quality of life). The usability and quality of the app were determined using the Mobile Application Rating Scale user version. RESULTS: The intervention group (n=19) increased their mean 6‐minute walking distance (83 meters, SD 72.2), while the control group (n=20) decreased their mean distance after 3 months of follow‐up (‐38.8 meters, SD 53.7; P=.01). The peripheral arterial disease‐related quality of life increased significantly in terms of "symptom perception" and "limitations in physical functioning." Users' feedback showed increased motivation and a changed attitude toward performing supervised exercise training. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the rating providing a valuable support tool for the user group, the mobile intervention TrackPAD was linked to a change in prognosis‐relevant outcome measures combined with enhanced coping with the disease. The influence of mobile interventions on long‐term prognosis must be evaluated in the future. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04947228; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04947228.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile apps provide an accessible way to test new health‐related methodologies. Tobacco is still the primary preventable cause of death in industrialized countries, constituting an important public health issue. New technologies provide novel opportunities that are effective in the cessation of smoking tobacco. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to evaluate the efficacy and usage of a mobile app for assisting adult smokers to quit smoking. METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized clinical trial. We included smokers older than 18 years who were motivated to stop smoking and used a mobile phone compatible with our mobile app. We carried out follow‐up visits at 15, 30, and 45 days, and at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. Participants of the intervention group had access to the Tobbstop mobile app designed by the research team. The primary outcomes were continuous smoking abstinence at 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 773 participants were included in the trial, of which 602 (77.9%) began the study on their D‐Day. Of participants in the intervention group, 34.15% (97/284) did not use the app. The continuous abstention level was significantly larger in the intervention group participants who used the app than in those who did not use the app at both 3 months (72/187, 38.5% vs 13/97, 13.4%; P<.001) and 12 months (39/187, 20.9% vs 8/97, 8.25%; P=.01). Participants in the intervention group who used the app regularly and correctly had a higher probability of not being smokers at 12 months (OR 7.20, 95% CI 2.14‐24.20; P=.001) than the participants of the CG. CONCLUSIONS: Regular use of an app for smoking cessation is effective in comparison with standard clinical practice.

AB  - - Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of disability and mortality globally. Premature fatal and non‐fatal CVD is considered to be largely preventable through the control of risk factors by lifestyle modifications and preventive medication. Lipid‐lowering and antihypertensive drug therapies for primary prevention are cost‐effective in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality among high‐risk people and are recommended by international guidelines. However, adherence to medication prescribed for the prevention of CVD can be poor. Approximately 9% of CVD cases in the EU are attributed to poor adherence to vascular medications. Low‐cost, scalable interventions to improve adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD have potential to reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with CVD. Objectives To establish the effectiveness of interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 7 January 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers on 5 February 2020. We searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials investigating interventions delivered wholly or partly by mobile phones to improve adherence to cardiovascular medications prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. We only included trials with a minimum of one‐year follow‐up in order that the outcome measures related to longer‐term, sustained medication adherence behaviours and outcomes. Eligible comparators were usual care or control groups receiving no mobile phone‐delivered component of the intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The main outcomes of interest were objective measures of medication adherence (blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol), CVD events, and adverse events. We contacted study authors for further information when this was not reported. Main results We included 14 trials with 25,633 randomised participants. Participants were recruited from community‐based primary and tertiary care or outpatient clinics. The interventions varied widely from those delivered solely through short messaging service (SMS) to those involving a combination of modes of delivery, such as SMS in addition to healthcare worker training, face‐to‐face counselling, electronic pillboxes, written materials, and home blood pressure monitors. Some interventions only targeted medication adherence, while others additionally targeted lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Due to heterogeneity in the nature and delivery of the interventions and study populations, we reported most results narratively, with the exception of two trials which were similar enough to meaningfully pool in meta‐analyses. The body of evidence for the effect of mobile phone‐based interventions on objective outcomes of adherence (BP and cholesterol) was of low certainty, due to most trials being at high risk of bias, and inconsistency in outcome effects. Two trials were at low risk of bias. Among five trials (total study enrolment: 5441 participants) recording low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), two studies found evidence for a small beneficial intervention effect on reducing LDL‐C (−5.30 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) −8.30 to −2.30; and −9.20 mg/dL, 95% CI −17.70 to −0.70). The other three studies found results varying from a small reduction (−7.7 mg/dL) to a small increase in LDL‐C (0.77 mg/dL). All of which had wide confidence intervals that included no effect. Across 13 studies (25,166 participants) measuring systolic blood pressure, effect estimates ranged from a large reduction (MD −12.45 mmHg, 95% CI −15.02 to −9.88) to a small increase (MD 2.80 mmHg, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.30). We found a similar range of effect estimates for diastolic BP, ranging from −12.23 mmHg (95% CI −14.03 to −10.43) to 1.64 mmHg (95% CI −0.55 to 3.83) (11 trials, 19,716 participants). Four trials showed intervention benefits for systolic and diastolic BP with confidence intervals excluding no effect, and among these were all three of the trials evaluating self‐monitoring of blood pressure with mobile phone‐based telemedicine. The fourth trial included SMS and provider support (with additional varied features). Seven studies (19,185 participants) reported 'controlled' BP as an outcome, and intervention effect estimates varied from negligible effects (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34) to large improvements in BP control (OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.57 to 3.68). The three trials of clinician training or decision support combined with SMS (with additional varied features) had confidence intervals encompassing benefits and harms, with point estimates close to zero. Pooled analyses of the two trials of interventions solely delivered through SMS were indicative of little or no beneficial intervention effect on systolic BP (MD −1.55 mmHg, 95% CI −3.36 to 0.25; I 2 = 0%) and small increases in controlled BP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; I 2 = 0%). Based on four studies (12,439 participants), there was very low‐certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision and once for risk of bias) relating to the intervention effect on combined (fatal and non‐fatal) CVD events. Two studies (2535 participants) provided low‐certainty evidence for the effect of the intervention on cognitive outcomes, with little or no difference between trial arms for perceived quality of care and satisfaction with treatment. There was moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) that the interventions did not cause harm, based on six studies (8285 participants). Three studies reported no adverse events attributable to the intervention. One study reported no difference between groups in experience of adverse effects of statins, and that no participants reported intervention‐related adverse events. One study stated that potential side effects were similar between groups. One study reported a similar number of deaths in each arm, but did not provide further information relating to potential adverse events. Authors' conclusions There is low‐certainty evidence on the effects of mobile phone‐delivered interventions to increase adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. Trials of BP self‐monitoring with mobile‐phone telemedicine support reported modest benefits. One trial at low risk of bias reported modest reductions in LDL cholesterol but no benefits for BP. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that these interventions do not result in harm. Further trials of these interventions are warranted. Plain language summary Interventions delivered by mobile phone to help people adhere to medication to prevent heart and circulatory disease Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of interventions delivered by mobile phone to help people in taking their medication to prevent cardiovascular disease (for example, heart attacks and strokes). Background Around 17.6 million people die from cardiovascular disease every year. Medications can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, but many people who have been given these medications do not take them as often or as consistently as recommended. This means that the medication will not work as well as it could to prevent cardiovascular disease. Interventions delivered through mobile phones, for example, prompting by text messaging, may be a low‐cost way to help people to take their medication as recommended. Study characteristics The evidence is up to date to January 2020. We found 14 studies that tested interventions delivered at least partly by mobile phone, which followed up participants for at least 12 months. Key results We were not able to combine the results of most of the trials, because the interventions were very different. Two studies were at low risk of bias and 12 were at high risk of bias. T e effects of the interventions were inconsistent across studies, and so we are not confident about their findings. Self‐monitoring of blood pressure plus telemedicine support by mobile phone may improve blood pressure control, but we are not confident about the findings due to trials being at risk of bias. Interventions delivered by text message alone may have little or no effect on blood pressure control. Interventions which included text messages and clinician training or clinician decision support (with or without additional features) may have little or no effect on blood pressure or cholesterol. The effects of the interventions which included text messages and provider support (with or without other features) were inconsistent across studies, and so we are not confident about their findings. We are uncertain about the effects of apps held by the patient or apps with additional provider support. Some interventions delivered by mobile phone may help people to take their medication, but the benefits are small or modest. Some trials found that the interventions did not have any beneficial effect. There was no evidence to suggest that these types of interventions caused harm.

AB  - PURPOSE: This randomized control trial was designed to examine the effect on the self‐managing ability for promoting bone health of mobile type‐bone health intervention (mobile type‐BHI). METHODS: The mobile type‐BHI consisted of a mobile application called "Strong bone, Fit body" (SbFb) and group education. A total of 82 college women with low bone mass (Z score < ‐1) participated. They were assigned randomly to three groups, experimental group I, (n = 28), experimental group II (n = 32), and control group (n = 22). This study ran from June 2014 to January 2015. The outcome variables were bone mineral density, minerals related to bone metabolism (calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D), biochemical markers related to bone remodeling (osteocalcin, C‐terminal telopeptide, sclerostin), food intake diary by 24 hours recall, and psychosocial variables related to bone health (knowledge, health belief and self‐efficacy). Data were analyzed using SAS program and a computer aided nutritional analysis program. RESULTS: Both the experimental group I, who used mobile type‐BHI, and experimental group II, who only received group education, showed outcomes regarding knowledge of the benefits of exercise and calcium as compared with the control group. The two experimental groups also demonstrated results in the serum levels of calcium, vitamin D, and sclerostin compared to those of the control group. CONCLUSION: Although both experimental groups exhibited positive outcomes in regards to the promotion of bone health, this study did not show an additional effect of the mobile application on self‐management ability for the promotion of bone health. Nonetheless, the SbFb application is very meaningful as it is the first application developed with the aim of improving women's bone health.

AB  - Objectives: This study was conducted to examine the effects of mobile health (mHealth), using mobile phones as an intervention for weight loss in obese adults. Methods: An electronic search was carried out using multiple databases. A meta-analysis of selected studies was performed. The effects of mHealth were analyzed using changes in body weight and body mass index (BMI). Results: We identified 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,318 participants who fit our inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that body weight was reduced with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of -2.35 kg (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.84 to -1.87). An examination of the impact of duration of intervention showed that weight loss was greater after 6 months of mHealth (WMD = -2.66 kg) than between three and four months (WMD = -2.25 kg); it was maintained for up to 9 months (WMD = -2.62 kg). At 12 months, weight loss was reduced to a WMD of -1.23 kg. BMI decreased with a WMD of -0.77 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (95% CI, -1.01 to -0.52). BMI changes were not statistically significant at 3 months (WMD = -1.10 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), but they were statistically significant at 6 months (WMD = -0.67 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Conclusions: The use of mHealth for obese adults showed a modest short-term effect on body weight and BMI. Although the weight loss associated with mHealth did not meet the recommendation of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network, which considers a reduction of approximately 5 to 10 kg of the initial body weight as a successful intervention. Well-designed RCTs are needed to reveal the effects of mHealth interventions.

AB  - AIM: To examine the effect of a 6‐month, smartphone app‐based self‐management program for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). BACKGROUND: Technological interventions have been used for chronic disease management, but the effect of a self‐management program using a smartphone app has not been evaluated in people with COPD. METHODS: For this randomized controlled trial, patients with COPD (NÂ =Â 44) were recruited in pulmonary medicine outpatient clinics at two, metropolitan, tertiary care, academic hospitals. Eligible participants were randomized into two groups and received group education and exercise sessions in the first month of the 6‐month intervention. Participants in the experimental group received a smartphone app‐based self‐management program, which included education, exercises, self‐monitoring of symptoms and exercise, and social support. Participants in the control group received one call a month from the research staff. Self‐care behavior was measured as a primary outcome. All measures were administered at baseline and at 6Â months. RESULTS: After randomization, the experimental group numbered 22, the control group numbered 20, and 2 participants dropped out. Significant differences between groups were found in change score for self‐care behavior, total activity count per wear time, and percent time spent in moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity over 6Â months. CONCLUSION: A self‐management program, using a smartphone app, can effect behavioral change in people with COPD. This program could be a boon to patients with COPD who have limited access to a health care provider, no opportunities for pulmonary rehabilitation, and frequent exacerbations.

AB  - Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has several adverse effects including loss of libido, osteoporosis, and metabolic complications. We aim to examine whether the Smart After-Care (SAC) service, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based lifestyle intervention, affects clinical outcomes in prostate cancer (PCa) patients on ADT. A prospective, multicenter, randomized trial including 172 patients randomly assigned to the SAC or control group was conducted. The SAC group was provided with a smartphone application providing a personalized exercise program, daily activity monitoring, and diet counselling. The control group was briefly educated on the exercise program using a paper brochure. The primary endpoint was increase in cardiorespiratory endurance assessed using the 2-minute walking test (2MWT). Secondary endpoints included improved muscle strength (hand grip strength test and 30-second chair stand test), short physical performance battery, body composition, and health-related quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and PR25). Participants in both groups showed significant improvement in the 2MWT and 30-second chair stand test after 12 weeks of intervention. Greater improvement in the 2MWT was observed in the SAC group than in the control group. Significantly increased body fat ratio was observed in both groups; however, decreased skeletal muscle mass was observed only in the control group. Marginal improvement in skeletal muscle mass was observed over time in the SAC group when compared with that in the control group. Both groups showed improvement in all physical scales in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire, and the SAC group showed a significant interaction of group and time for social functioning scales. SAC improved cardiorespiratory endurance, sarcopenic obesity, and health-related quality of life in patients with PCa on ADT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an exercise-based program prescribed after cardiac events associated with improved physical, mental, and social functioning; however, many patients return to a sedentary lifestyle leading to deteriorating functional capacity after discharge from CR. Physical activity (PA) is critical to avoid recurrence of cardiac events and mortality and maintain functional capacity. Leveraging mobile health (mHealth) strategies to increase adherence to PA is a promising approach. Based on the social cognitive theory, we sought to determine whether mHealth strategies (Movn mobile app for self-monitoring, supportive push-through messages, and wearable activity tracker) would improve PA and functional capacity over 2 months. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to examine preliminary effects of an mHealth intervention on group differences in PA and functional capacity and group differences in depression and self-efficacy to maintain exercise after CR. METHODS: During the final week of outpatient CR, patients were randomized 1:1 to the intervention group or usual care. The intervention group downloaded the Movn mobile app, received supportive push-through messages on motivation and educational messages related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) management 3 times per week, and wore a Charge 2 (Fitbit Inc) activity tracker to track step counts. Participants in the usual care group wore a pedometer and recorded their daily steps in a diary. Data from the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 2 months. RESULTS: We recruited 60 patients from 2 CR sites at a community hospital in Northern California. The mean age was 68.0 (SD 9.3) years, and 23% (14/60) were female; retention rate was 85% (51/60). Our results from 51 patients who completed follow-up showed the intervention group had a statistically significant higher mean daily step count compared with the control (8860 vs 6633; P=.02). There was no difference between groups for the 6MWT, depression, or self-efficacy to maintain exercise. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention addresses a major public health initiative to examine the potential for mobile health strategies to promote PA in patients with CVD. Our technology-based pilot mHealth intervention provides promising results on a pragmatic and contemporary approach to promote PA by increasing daily step counts after completing CR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of weight gain disproportionally affects young adults. Understanding the underlying behavioural mechanisms of change in mHealth nutrition and physical activity interventions designed for young adults is important for enhancing and translating effective interventions. PURPOSE: First, we hypothesised that knowledge, self‐efficacy and stage‐of‐change for nutrition and physical activity behaviours would improve, and second, that self‐efficacy changes in nutrition and physical activity behaviours mediate the behaviour changes observed in an mHealth RCT for prevention of weight gain. METHODS: Young adults, aged 18‐35 years at risk of weight gain (n = 250) were randomly assigned to an mHealth‐program, TXT2BFiT, consisting of a three‐month intensive phase and six‐month maintenance phase or to a control group. Self‐reported online surveys at baseline, three‐ and nine‐months assessed nutrition and physical activity behaviours, knowledge, self‐efficacy and stage‐of‐change. The mediating effect of self‐efficacy was assessed in multiple PROCESS macro‐models for three‐ and nine‐month nutrition and physical activity behaviour change. RESULTS: Young adults randomised to the intervention increased and maintained knowledge of fruit requirements (P = 0.029) compared to controls. Intervention participants' fruit and takeaway behaviours improved to meet recommendations at nine months, with a greater proportion progressing to action or maintenance stage‐of‐change (P < 0.001 and P = 0.012 respectively) compared to controls. Intervention participants' vegetable and physical activity behaviours did not meet recommendations, thereby halting progress to action or maintenance stage‐of‐change. Indirect effects of improved nutrition and physical activity behaviours at three‐ and nine‐months in the intervention group were explained by changes in self‐efficacy, accounting for 8%‐37% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: This provides insights into how the mHealth intervention achieved part of its effects and the importance of improving self‐efficacy to facilitate improved eating and physical activity behaviours in young adults.

AB  - Self-monitoring of dietary intake is a valuable component of behavioral weight loss treatment but engagement in self-monitoring declines quickly, resulting in suboptimal treatment outcomes. This dissertation examined a novel weight loss intervention that aims to lessen the decline in self-monitoring engagement by building mastery, self-efficacy, and self-regulatory skills key constructs of behavior change prior to self-monitoring diet. GoalTracker was a randomized controlled trial among 105 adults with overweight or obesity comparing three standalone 12-week weight loss interventions: (1) a Simultaneous arm with concurrent self-monitoring of weight and diet each day, along with weekly lessons, action plans, and tailored feedback via email; (2) a Sequential arm with the same components but that tracked only weight through week 4, then added diet tracking; and (3) an App-Only arm that only tracked diet, and did not receive additional behavior change components. All groups used the commercial app MyFitnessPal for self-monitoring and received a tailored calorie goal and a goal to lose 5% of initial weight by 12 weeks. Paper one examined the impact of the intervention on weight change and self-monitoring engagement (Aims 1-3) and found significant weight loss and engagement for all treatment arms, with no differences between arms. Paper two examined the relation between consistent self-monitoring and weight loss (Aim 4), revealing that consistent trackers lost significantly more weight than others. Lastly, paper three examined whether early weight loss predicts future engagement and weight loss success (Aim 5), which was supported. Regardless of the order in which diet is tracked, using tailored goals and a commercial app can produce clinically significant weight loss. Consistent self-monitoring and early weight loss should be emphasized. Standalone digital health treatments may be a viable option for those looking for a lower intensity approach.

AB  - Objective: Early weight loss is a strong predictor of longer‐term and clinically meaningful weight loss but has not been studied in the context of mobile health (‘mHealth’) interventions. Methods: GoalTracker was a randomized trial among adults (21–65 years) with overweight or obesity comparing three 12‐week standalone mHealth interventions for weight loss. All arms received a free commercial mobile app (MyFitnessPal) for daily self‐monitoring of diet and/or weight and a goal to lose 5% of weight by 3 months. Collapsing across arms, this analysis examined participants with a 1‐month weight (n = 84), categorizing them as either early responders (≥2% weight loss at 1 month) or early non‐responders (<2% weight loss at 1 month). Results: Early responders – 36% of participants – had greater per cent weight change at 3 months (−5.93% [95% confidence interval: −6.82%, −5.03%]) than early non‐responders (−1.45% [−2.15%, −0.75%]), which was sustained at 6 months (−5.91% [−7.33%, −4.48%] vs. −1.28% [−2.37%, −0.19%]; ps < 0.0001). Over half (57%) of early responders achieved ≥5% weight loss at 3 months vs. 11% of early non‐responders. At 4 weeks, self‐monitoring frequency (weight/diet) was significantly greater among early responders, which continued across 12 weeks. Conclusion: Responding early to an mHealth treatment is associated with higher engagement and greater likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self‐monitoring of dietary intake is a valuable component of behavioral weight loss treatment; however, it declines quickly, thereby resulting in suboptimal treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine a novel behavioral weight loss intervention that aims to attenuate the decline in dietary self‐monitoring engagement. METHODS: GoalTracker was an automated randomized controlled trial. Participants were adults with overweight or obesity (n=105; aged 21‐65 years; body mass index, BMI, 25‐45 kg/m2) and were randomized to a 12‐week stand‐alone weight loss intervention using the MyFitnessPal smartphone app for daily self‐monitoring of either (1) both weight and diet, with weekly lessons, action plans, and feedback (Simultaneous); (2) weight through week 4, then added diet, with the same behavioral components (Sequential); or (3) only diet (App‐Only). All groups received a goal to lose 5% of initial weight by 12 weeks, a tailored calorie goal, and automated in‐app reminders. Participants were recruited via online and offline methods. Weight was collected in‐person at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months using calibrated scales and via self‐report at 6 months. We retrieved objective self‐monitoring engagement data from MyFitnessPal using an application programming interface. Engagement was defined as the number of days per week in which tracking occurred, with diet entries counted if ≥800 kcal per day. Other assessment data were collected in‐person via online self‐report questionnaires. RESULTS: At baseline, participants (84/100 female) had a mean age (SD) of 42.7 (11.7) years and a BMI of 31.9 (SD 4.5) kg/m2. One‐third (33/100) were from racial or ethnic minority groups. During the trial, 5 participants became ineligible. Of the remaining 100 participants, 84% (84/100) and 76% (76/100) completed the 1‐month and 3‐month visits, respectively. In intent‐to‐treat analyses, there was no difference in weight change at 3 months between the Sequential arm (mean ‐2.7 kg, 95% CI ‐3.9 to ‐1.5) and either the App‐Only arm (‐2.4 kg, ‐3.7 to ‐1.2; P=.78) or the Simultaneous arm (‐2.8 kg, ‐4.0 to ‐1.5; P=.72). The median number of days of self‐monitoring diet per week was 1.9 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.3‐5.5) in Sequential (once began), 5.3 (IQR 1.8‐6.7) in Simultaneous, and 2.9 (IQR 1.2‐5.2) in App‐Only. Weight was tracked 4.8 (IQR 1.9‐6.3) days per week in Sequential and 5.1 (IQR 1.8‐6.3) days per week in Simultaneous. Engagement in neither diet nor weight tracking differed between arms. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the order in which diet is tracked, using tailored goals and a commercial mobile app can produce clinically significant weight loss. Stand‐alone digital health treatments may be a viable option for those looking for a lower intensity approach.

AB  - Importance: Gamification, the use of game design elements in nongame contexts, is increasingly being used in workplace wellness programs and digital health applications. However, the best way to design social incentives in gamification interventions has not been well examined. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of support, collaboration, and competition within a behaviorally designed gamification intervention to increase physical activity among overweight and obese adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 36‐week randomized clinical trial with a 24‐week intervention and 12‐week follow‐up assessed 602 adults from 40 states with body mass indexes (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 25 or higher from February 12, 2018, to March 17, 2019. Interventions: Participants used a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, were randomly assigned to a control (n = 151) or to 1 of 3 gamification interventions (support [n = 151], collaboration [n = 150], and competition [n = 150]), and were remotely monitored. The control group received feedback from the wearable device but no other interventions for 36 weeks. The gamification arms were entered into a 24‐week game designed using insights from behavioral economics with points and levels for achieving step goals. No gamification interventions occurred during follow‐up. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline through the 24‐week intervention period. Results: A total of 602 participants (mean [SD] age, 39 [10] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 30 [5]; 427 [70.9%] male) were included in the study. Compared with controls, participants had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during the intervention in the competition arm (adjusted difference, 920; 95% CI, 513‐1328; P <.001), support arm (adjusted difference, 689; 95% CI, 267‐977; P <.001), and collaboration arm (adjusted difference, 637; 95% CI, 258‐1017; P =.001). During follow‐up, physical activity remained significantly greater in the competition arm than in the control arm (adjusted difference, 569; 95% CI, 142‐996; P =.009) but was not significantly greater in the support (adjusted difference, 428; 95% CI, 19‐837; P =.04) and collaboration (adjusted difference, 126; 95% CI, ‐248 to 468; P =.49) arms than in the control arm. Conclusions and Relevance: All 3 gamification interventions significantly increased physical activity during the 24‐week intervention, and competition was the most effective. Physical activity was lower in all arms during follow‐up and only remained significantly greater in the competition arm than in the control arm.

AB  - Self‐monitoring is the strongest predictor of success in lifestyle interventions for obesity. In this secondary analysis of the GoalTracker trial, we describe outcomes of consistently self‐monitoring in a standalone weight loss intervention. The 12‐week intervention focused on daily self‐monitoring of diet and/or body weight in a commercial app (MyFitnessPal). Participants (N = 100; 21‐65 years; BMI 25‐45 kg/m2) were categorized as Consistent Trackers if they tracked ≥ 6 out of 7 days for at least 75% of the targeted weeks. One‐fourth of participants were Consistent Trackers. This subset was more likely to be married or living with a partner, be non‐Hispanic White, and have higher health literacy than Inconsistent Trackers (ps < .05). Consistent tracking was associated with greater weight change than inconsistent tracking at 1 month (mean difference [95% CI] ‐ 1.11 kg [‐ 2.12, ‐ 0.10]), 3 months (‐ 2.42 kg [‐ 3.80, ‐ 1.04]), and 6 months (‐ 2.13 kg [‐ 3.99, ‐ 0.27]). Over 3 times as many Consistent Trackers as Inconsistent Trackers achieved ≥ 5% weight loss at 3 months (48 vs. 13%) and at 6 months (54 vs. 15%; ps < .001). Though causality cannot be determined by the present study, tracking weight and/or diet nearly every day per week for 12 weeks in a commercial app may serve as an effective strategy for weight loss. Strategies are needed to promote greater consistency in tracking.

AB  - Background. Diabetes and its complications are becoming a major threat to public health. Quality of life among diabetes patients is not optimum. Objective. To know the usefulness of the mobile health application for improvement of QoL and diabetes selfmanagement activities of the type 2 diabetes patients. Methods. The present study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital for 2 years from October 2016 to October 2018. In this study, 66 newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients, educated, techno‐friendly smart phone users, aged between 18‐60 years, were included. They were allocated to intervention and control group by block randomization method. Intervention group was allotted to use the android application and control group was allotted to use the website. The data were imported and analyzed by SPSS v 20. Results. Overall quality of life and general health was 70.26 ± 16.51; for physical health it was 59.52 ± 7.15, for psychological it was 63.38 ± 9.2, for social relations it was 74.87 ± 13.98 and for environment it was 71.87 ± ± 8.38. The score of overall quality of life was increased in both control and intervention group during follow‐ups. It was found that there was significant improvement in glucose management, dietary control, physical activity, health care use and sum score. Wilk's lambda was significant for HbA1c both in control and intervention group. Conclusions. Mobile‐based applications with focusing on diabetes self‐management education may support to reduce the complications of diabetes and improve the QoL of diabetes patients.

AB  - Background: Following stroke, people are generally less active and more sedentary which can worsen outcomes. Mobile phone applications (apps) can support change in health behaviors. We developed STARFISH, a mobile phone app‐based intervention, which incorporates evidence‐based behavior change techniques (feedback, self‐monitoring and social support), in which users’ physical activity is visualized by fish swimming. Objective: To evaluate the potential effectiveness of STARFISH in stroke survivors. Method: Twenty‐three people with stroke (12 women; age: 56.0 ± 10.0 years, time since stroke: 4.2 ± 4.0 years) from support groups in Glasgow completed the study. Participants were sequentially allocated in a 2:1 ratio to intervention (n = 15) or control (n = 8) groups. The intervention group followed the STARFISH program for six weeks; the control group received usual care. Outcome measures included physical activity, sedentary time, heart rate, blood pressure, body mass index, Fatigue Severity Scale, Instrumental Activity of Daily Living Scale, Ten‐Meter Walk Test, Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale, and Psychological General Well‐Being Index. Results: The average daily step count increased by 39.3% (4158 to 5791 steps/day) in the intervention group and reduced by 20.2% (3694 to 2947 steps/day) in the control group (p = 0.005 for group–time interaction). Similar patterns of data and group–time interaction were seen for walking time (p = 0.002) and fatigue (p = 0.003). There were no significant group–time interactions for other outcome measures. Conclusion: Use of STARFISH has the potential to improve physical activity and health outcomes in people after stroke and longer term intervention trials are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is common in multiple sclerosis (MS), but the definition of the best cognitive rehabilitation tools and features is still an open issue among researchers. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effectiveness of COGNI‐TRAcK (a customized application software delivering personalized working memory‐based exercises) on cognitively impaired people with MS and to investigate the effects of an adaptive vs. a non‐adaptive cognitive training administered by means of COGNI‐TRAcK. METHODS: Twenty eight patients (20 women, age 47.5 ± 9.3 years, Expanded Disability Status Scale score 3.8 ± 1.9) were randomized in two homogeneous groups, both performing a 8‐week home‐based cognitive rehabilitation treatment by means of COGNI‐TRAcK. The study group (ADAPT‐gr) underwent an adaptive training given by the automatic adjustment of tasks difficulty to the subjects' performance, whilst the control group (CONST‐gr) was trained at constant difficulty levels. Before and after the treatment, patients' cognitive status was assessed using a gold standard neuropsychological evaluation. Moreover, the mostly affected cognitive domains in MS (i.e., attention, concentration and information processing speed) were also assessed 6 months after the end of the treatment. RESULTS: The analysis of variance showed a significant Group*Time interaction in six out of ten tests of the cognitive evaluation. Post‐hoc analysis revealed a significant improvement between the performances before and after the intervention only in the ADAPT‐gr in tests evaluating verbal memory acquisition (p <0.05) and delayed recall (p = 0.001), verbal fluency (p = 0.01), sustained attention, concentration and information processing speed (p < 0.01). This last effect was maintained also after 6 months (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that COGNI‐TRAcK represents a suitable tool to administer a personalized training to cognitively impaired subjects and that an adaptive working load is a crucial feature determining the effectiveness of cognitive treatment, allowing transfer effects to several cognitive domains and long‐term maintenance of results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many smoking cessation smartphone apps exist, few have been independently evaluated, particularly in older populations. In 2017, of the 112 commercially available smoking cessation apps in Australia, only 6 were deemed to be of high quality, in that they partially adhered to Australian guidelines. Mobile health (mHealth) apps have the potential to modify smoking behavior at a relatively low cost; however, their acceptability in older smokers remains unknown. Rigorous scientific evaluation of apps is thus urgently needed to assist smokers and clinicians alike. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility of a large-scale trial to assess the use and acceptability of a high-quality smoking cessation app in older smokers. METHODS: Adult inpatient and outpatient smokers with computer and smartphone access were recruited face to face and via telephone interviews from Metropolitan Hospitals in Brisbane, Australia. Participants were randomized 1:1 to the intervention (requested to download the "My QuitBuddy" smoking cessation app on their smartphone) or the control group (provided access to a tailored smoking cessation support webpage [Quit HQ]). The My QuitBuddy app is freely available from app stores and provides personalized evidenced-based smoking cessation support. Quit HQ offers regular email support over 12 weeks. No training or instructions on the use of these e-resources were given to participants. Outcomes at 3 months included recruitment and retention rates, use and acceptability of e-resource (User Version of the Mobile App Rating Scale [uMARS]), changes in quitting motivation (10-point scale), and self-reported smoking abstinence. RESULTS: We randomized 64 of 231 potentially eligible individuals (27.7%). The mean age of participants was 62 (SD 8). Nicotine dependence was moderate (mean Heaviness of Smoking Index [HSI] 2.8 [SD 1.2]). At 3 months the retention rate was (58/64, 91%). A total of 15 of 31 participants in the intervention arm (48%) used the app at least once, compared with 10 of 33 (30%) in the control arm. uMARS scores for e-resource use and acceptability were statistically similar (P=.29). Motivation to quit was significantly higher in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (median 6 [IQR 4-8] versus 4 [IQR 4-5], respectively, P=.02). According to the intention-to-treat analysis, smoking abstinence was nonsignificantly higher in the intervention group (4/31 [13%], 95% CI 4%-30%, versus 2/33 [6%], 95% CI 1%-20%; P=.42). The estimated number needed to treat was 14. CONCLUSIONS: Internet and mHealth smoking cessation resources appear acceptable to a minority of older smokers. Smokers who engaged with the allocated e-resources rated them equally, and there were trends toward greater uptake, increased motivation, and higher abstinence rates in the app group; however, only the change in motivation reached statistical significance (median score 6 versus 4, respectively, P=.02). This results of this pilot study suggest that apps may improve quit outcomes in older adults who are willing to use them. Further research into user-app interactions should be undertaken to facilitate improvements in app design and consumer engagement. These favorable trends should be explored in larger trials with sufficient statistical power.

The number of secondary health care consultations (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes were assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months via online questionnaires. Data were analyzed using longitudinal mixed models, corrected for baseline values. Due to the design of this study, blinding of participants and researchers was not possible. Results: In total, 427 eligible participants were allocated to either the dr. Bart group (n = 214) or usual care (n = 213). We found no difference between groups in the number of secondary (i.e., orthopaedic surgeon, rheumatologist, or physician assistant) health care consultations (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.20 (95% CI: 0.67; 2.19)). We found positive treatment effects of the dr. Bart app on symptoms (2.6 (95% CI: 0.4; 4.9)), pain (3.5 (95% CI: 0.9; 6.0)), and activities of daily living (2.9 (95% CI: 0.2; 5.6)) on a 0â€“100 scale, higher score indicating less complaints, but not in any other secondary outcome. Conclusion: The dr. Bart app did not change the number of secondary health care consultations compared to usual care. However, we found small positive effects (not clinically relevant) on pain, symptoms, and activities of daily living in people with knee/hip OA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is frequently suboptimal in adults with chronic diseases, resulting in negative consequences. Traditional interventions to improve adherence are complex and not widely effective. Mobile applications may be a scalable means to support medication adherence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of mobile apps on medication adherence in adults with chronic diseases. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of any mobile application (app) intervention directed at patients with chronic disease to improve medication adherence in comparison with usual care. A random-effects model was used to pool the outcome data. Risk of bias and quality of study were assessed per Cochrane guidelines. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this systematic review involving 1,785 participants, 940 of whom were randomized to a mobile app intervention group and 845 to the usual care group. The meta-analysis showed that the use of mobile apps was associated with a significant improvement in patient adherence to medication (Cohen's d = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.27-0.52; P < 0.001), with a low quality of GRADE evidence. There was no evidence of publication bias (Egger's test; P = 0.81) or substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 29%). In the sensitivity analysis, our findings remained robust to change in inclusion criteria based on study quality (Cohen's d = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33-0.54; P < 0.001). The included apps incorporated 9 features, sorted from high to low based on relative weights (RW): documentation (RW = 0.254), medication reminder (RW = 0.204), data sharing (RW = 0.148), feedback message (RW = 0.104), clinical decision support (RW = 0.097), education (RW = 0.081), customization (RW = 0.049), data statistics (RW = 0.041), and appointment reminder (RW = 0.041). In the subgroup analysis, the effect was not sensitive to study characteristics or app features (0.37 ≤ P ≤ 0.95). App acceptability was reported by participants in the intervention group in 8 studies: 144 of 156 participants (91.7%) were satisfied with all aspects of the apps. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional care, mobile apps are effective interventions to help improve medication adherence in adults with chronic diseases. Although promising, these results should be interpreted with caution given the low level of evidence and short intervention duration. Future research will not only need to identify ideal app features and the costs to providers but also need to improve the apps to make them user friendly, secure, and effective based on patient-centered theory. DISCLOSURES: Funding for this study was provided by Chongqing Science and Technology Bureau (No. cstc2017shmsA130115). The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.

AB  - Poor adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a major global challenge. In this study we examined the efficacy of a smartphone application incorporating personalized health‐related visual imagery that provided real‐time information about the level of medication and the patient's level of immunoprotection, in order to improve adherence to ART. We randomized 28 people on ART to either a standard or augmented version of the smartphone application. The augmented version contained components that illustrated participants' current estimated plasma concentrations of antiretroviral drugs and the immune protection provided by ART. Adherence to ART was assessed at baseline and at 3 months using self‐reported adherence, pharmacy dispensing records, and HIV viral load. Information was also collected on illness and medication beliefs and use of the application. Participants who received the augmented application showed a significantly higher level of self‐reported adherence to ART at 3 months (p=0.03) and decreased viral load (p=0.023) as compared to individuals using the standard version. Greater usage of the extra components of the augmented application was associated with greater perceived understanding of HIV infection and increased perceived necessity for ART. Smartphone applications that incorporate personalized health‐related visual imagery may have potential to improve adherence to ART.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 20% to 50% of patients do not take their medication correctly, and this leads to increased morbidity and inefficacy of therapeutic approaches. Fostering treatment adherence is a priority objective for all health systems. The growth of mobile apps to facilitate therapeutic adherence has significantly increased in recent years. However, the effectiveness of the apps for this purpose has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze whether mobile apps are perceived as useful for managing medication at home and if they actually contribute to increasing treatment adherence in patients. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review of research published using Scopus, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, and MEDLINE databases and analyzed the information about their contribution to increasing therapeutic adherence and the perceived usefulness of mobile apps. This review examined studies published between 2000 and 2017. RESULTS: Overall, 11 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The sample sizes of these studies varied between 16 and 99 participants. In addition, 7 studies confirmed that the mobile app increased treatment adherence. In 5 of them, the before and after adherence measures suggested significant statistical improvements, when comparing self-reported adherence and missed dose with a percentage increase ranging between 7% and 40%. The users found mobile apps easy to use and useful for managing their medication. The patients were mostly satisfied with their use, with an average score of 8.1 out of 10. CONCLUSIONS: The use of mobile apps helps increase treatment adherence, and they are an appropriate method for managing medication at home.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess whether a version of the Smoke Free app with a supportive chatbot powered by artificial intelligence (versus a version without the chatbot) led to increased engagement and short-term quit success. Methods: Daily or non-daily smokers aged >=18 years who purchased the 'pro' version of the app and set a quit date were randomly assigned (unequal allocation) to receive the app with or without the chatbot. The outcomes were engagement (i.e. total number of logins over the study period) and self-reported abstinence at a one-month follow-up. Unadjusted and adjusted negative binomial and logistic regression models were fitted to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for the associations of interest. Results: A total of 57,214 smokers were included (intervention: 9.3% (5339); control: 90.7% (51,875). The app with the chatbot compared with the standard version led to a 101% increase in engagement (IRR<sub>adj</sub> = 2.01, 95% confidence interval <b>(</b>CI) = 1.92-2.11, p < .001). The one-month follow-up rate was 10.6% (intervention: 19.9% (1,061/5,339); control: 9.7% (5,050/51,875). Smokers allocated to the intervention had greater odds of quit success (missing equals smoking: 844/5,339 vs. 3,704/51,875, OR<sub>adj</sub> = 2.38, 95% CI = 2.19-2.58, p < .001; follow-up only: 844/1,061 vs. 3,704/5,050, OR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.16-1.61, p < .001). Conclusion: The addition of a supportive chatbot to a popular smoking cessation app more than doubled user engagement. In view of very low follow-up rates, there is low quality evidence that the addition also increased self-reported smoking cessation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It was hypothesized that a mobile health (mHealth) intervention would elicit greater improvements in systolic blood pressure and other cardiometabolic risk factors at 12 weeks, which would be better maintained over 52 weeks, compared to the active control intervention. METHODS: Eligible participants (≥2 metabolic syndrome risk factors) were randomized to the mHealth intervention (n = 75) or the active control group (n = 74). Blood pressure and other cardiometabolic risk factors were measured at baseline and at 12, 24 and 52 weeks. Both groups received an individualized exercise prescription and the intervention group additionally received a technology kit for home monitoring of biometrics and physical activity. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on 67 participants in the intervention group (aged 56.7 ± 9.7 years; 71.6% female) and 60 participants in the active control group (aged 59.1 ± 8.4 years; 76.7% female). At 12 weeks, baseline adjusted mean change in systolic blood pressure (primary outcome) was greater in the active control group compared to the intervention group (‐5.68 mmHg; 95% CI ‐10.86 to ‐0.50 mmHg; p = 0.03), but there were no differences between groups in mean change for secondary outcomes. Over 52‐weeks, the difference in mean change for systolic blood pressure was no longer apparent between groups, but remained significant across the entire population (time: p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In participants with increased cardiometabolic risk, exercise prescription alone had greater short‐term improvements in systolic blood pressure compared to the mHealth intervention, though over 52 weeks, improvements were equal between interventions.

AB  - Chronic pain is one of the major causes of disability in the general population. Even though there are effective treatment options available for reducing symptoms, these treatments often do not have consistent lasting effects. As the usage of mobile devices has increased enormously during the last few years, mobile application-based treatment options are widespread. Such app-based programs are not yet empirically proven but might enable patients to become more independent in their pain management in order to prevent relapse. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize the literature on mobile application-based interventions for chronic pain patients. Therefore, three electronic bibliographic databases, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, were searched for studies that investigated the effectiveness of mobile application-based intervention for chronic pain on pain intensity. The final sample comprised twenty-two studies, with a total of 4679 individuals. Twelve of these twenty-two studies used a randomized control trial (RCT) design, while ten studies only used an observational design. For all twenty-two studies, a small but significant effect (d = -0.40) was found when compared to baseline measures or control groups. The results suggest that apps-based treatment can be helpful in reducing pain, especially in the long-term.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Meeting the complex needs of patients with chronic common mental health disorders (CMHDs) may be the greatest challenge facing organized medical practice. On the basis of a well-established and proven theoretical foundation for controlled respiration as a behavioral intervention for CMHDs, as well as preliminary evidence that gamification can improve health outcomes through increasing patient engagement, this randomized controlled pilot study evaluated the feasibility and clinical efficacy of a mobile health game called "Flowy" ( www.flowygame.com ) that digitally delivered breathing retraining exercises for anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptom management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed an unblinded, Web-based, parallel-group randomized controlled trial focusing on feasibility, clinical efficacy, and design proof of concept. In the intervention condition (n = 31), participants received free access to "Flowy" for 4 weeks. In the control condition (n = 32), participants were placed on a waitlist for 4 weeks before being offered free access to "Flowy." Online measurements using psychological self-report questionnaires were made at 2 and 4 weeks post-baseline. RESULTS: At trial conclusion, participants found "Flowy" acceptable as an anxiety management intervention. "Flowy" engaged participants sufficiently to endorse proactive gameplay. Intent-to-treat analysis revealed a reduction in anxiety, panic, and self-report hyperventilation scores in both trial arms, with the intervention arm experiencing greater quality of life. Participants perceived "Flowy" as a fun and useful intervention, proactively used "Flowy" as part of their care, and would recommend "Flowy" to family and friends. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a digital delivery of breathing retraining exercises through a mobile health game can manage anxiety, panic, and hyperventilation symptoms associated with CMHDs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of time for exercise is common among office workers given their busy lives. Because of occupational restrictions and difficulty in taking time off, it is necessary to suggest effective ways for workers to exercise regularly. Sustaining lifestyle habits that increase nonexercise activity in daily life can solve the issue of lack of exercise time. Healthy Lifestyle Coaching Chatbot is a messenger app based on the habit formation model that can be used as a tool to provide a health behavior intervention that emphasizes the importance of sustainability and involvement. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the Healthy Lifestyle Coaching Chatbot intervention presented via a messenger app aimed at stair‐climbing habit formation for office workers. METHODS: From February 1, 2018, to April 30, 2018, a total of 106 people participated in the trial after online recruitment. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=57) or the control group (n=49). The intervention group received cues and intrinsic and extrinsic rewards for the entire 12 weeks. However, the control group did not receive intrinsic rewards for the first 4 weeks and only received all rewards as in the intervention group from the fifth to twelfth week. The Self‐Report Habit Index (SRHI) of participants was evaluated every week, and the level of physical activity was measured at the beginning and end of the trial. SPSS Statistics version 21 (IBM Corp) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of intervention without providing the intrinsic rewards in the control group, the change in SRHI scores was 13.54 (SD 14.99) in the intervention group and 6.42 (SD 9.42) in the control group, indicating a significant difference between the groups (P=.04). When all rewards were given to both groups, from the fifth to twelfth week, the change in SRHI scores of the intervention and control groups was comparable at 12.08 (SD 10.87) and 15.88 (SD 13.29), respectively (P=.21). However, the level of physical activity showed a significant difference between the groups after 12 weeks of intervention (P=.045). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that intrinsic rewards are important to enhance the sustainability and effectiveness of an intervention. The Healthy Lifestyle Coaching Chatbot program can be a cost‐effective method for healthy habit formation.

AB  - Mental and emotional health concerns among college students are prevalent and diverse in their symptom presentations. With increasing demands on counseling centers to provide efficient care and to address students with higher acuity or risk for harm, there has been an increased focus on identifying therapeutic targets that underlie a wide breadth of concerns to broaden the scope and impact of mental health services. Psychological inflexibility is one such target and refers to a combination of excessive avoidance of internal experiences coupled with a lack of actions that align with a person's values. Interventions for psychological inflexibility aim to support people in reducing actions that are mostly about avoiding unwanted thoughts and feelings and actions that involve moving towards chosen values. Such interventions may produce changes in people's actions in part through helping people notice and label the different roles their actions play in relation to thoughts, feelings, and personal values. However, the skill of noticing and labeling the purposes of one's actions has not been studied in interventions for psychological inflexibility despite being discussed in theoretical writings. Training this skill may serve as a direct means of reducing psychological inflexibility and as a foundation for other interventions, thus it may be a relevant target in interventions for psychological inflexibility among college students. Given this, the present study developed and tested an intervention focused on noticing and labeling one's actions as an intervention for psychological inflexibility in a college student sample, as delivered through web and app-based media. The study recruited 106 students with symptoms of depression and anxiety from a medium sized university in the Mountain West of the United States, and then randomly assigned them to either wait for eight weeks or receive a three-week online and app-based training for noticing and labeling avoidant and values-consistent actions. The results of the study indicated short-term effects on symptoms of depression and anxiety for participants who received the online and app-based training as compared with participants who were asked to wait, although both groups showed reductions in symptoms by the end of the study period. Participants did not report changes in the target skill of noticing and labeling their actions although the study did find larger reductions in psychological inflexibility among participants who received the training as compared with those asked to wait. Further, changes in psychological flexibility were related to changes in behavioral activity and life satisfaction, but not life quality. The results raise questions about the necessity of training the ability to notice and label one's actions as a direct intervention mechanism for psychological inflexibility. The findings also suggest that changing inflexible patterns of behavior may be more important than the capacity to notice such changes. These results are further interpreted in relation to interventions for college student mental and emotional health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: The speed of physiological recovery from stress may be a marker for cardiovascular disease risk. Stress management programs that incorporate guided breathing have been shown to moderate the stress response and augment recovery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an app-based brief relaxation intervention (BioBase) for facilitating physiological recovery in individuals exposed to a brief psychological stressor. METHODS: A total of 75 participants (44 women) completed a stressor speech task and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: control, rumination, or an app-based relaxation breathing (BioBase) conditions. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed as a measure of autonomic function at baseline (6 min), during stress (6 min), and during recovery (6 min). RESULTS: There was a significant increase in subjective stress following stress exposure, but the ratings returned to baseline after recovery in all three groups. In addition, there was a significant decrease in vagally mediated HRV in the poststress period. During recovery, the root mean square of successive differences (P<.001), the percentage of successive interbeat (RR) intervals that differ by >50 ms (pNN50; P<.001), and high-frequency (P<.02) HRV were significantly higher in the BioBase breathing condition than the rumination and control conditions. There was no difference in HRV values between the rumination and control conditions during recovery. CONCLUSIONS: App-based relaxed breathing interventions could be effective in reducing cardiovascular disease risk. These results provide additional utility of biofeedback breathing in augmenting physiological recovery from psychological stress.

AB  - The risk and prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) has dramatically increased over the past decade. The aim of this study was to develop, implement and evaluate a physical activity intervention to improve aerobic and muscular fitness among adults at risk of, or diagnosed with T2D. A 20‐week, assessor blinded, parallel‐group randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at the University of Newcastle (June‐December 2015). Adults were randomized to the intervention (n=42) or wait‐list control group (n=42). The theory‐based intervention included: Phase 1 (weeks 1‐10) integrated group sessions (outdoor physical activity and cognitive mentoring), and the eCoFit smartphone application (app). Phase 2 (weeks 11‐20) only included the eCoFit app. Participants were assessed at baseline, 10weeks and 20weeks. Linear mixed models (intention‐to‐treat) were used to determine group‐by‐time interactions at 10weeks (primary time‐point) and 20weeks for the primary outcomes. Several secondary outcomes were also assessed. After 10weeks, significant group‐by‐time effects were observed for aerobic fitness (4.5mL/kg/min; 95% CI [1.3, 7.7], d=0.68) and muscular fitness (lower body) (3.4 reps, 95% CI [2.7, 4.2], d=1.45). Intervention effects for secondary outcomes included significant increased physical activity (1330steps/week), improved upper body muscular fitness (5 reps; arm‐curl test), improved functionality (‐1.8s; timed‐up and go test) reduced waist circumference (2.8cm) and systolic blood pressure (‐10.4mmHg). After 20weeks, significant effects were observed for lower body muscular fitness and health outcomes. eCoFit is an innovative lifestyle intervention which integrates smartphone technology, social support, and the outdoor environment to improve aerobic and muscular fitness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity is considered a comprehensive approach for managing limitations in physical function among adults with chronic disabling conditions. However, adults with chronic disabling conditions often face many barriers to engaging in physical activity. A strategy to promote physical activity among adults with chronic disabling conditions is to encourage the use of mobile health (mHealth) apps. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study was to examine the potential benefits of using commercially available mHealth apps in a self-management intervention among 46 adults with musculoskeletal or neurological conditions. METHODS: Participants were randomized to one of 3 intervention groups: (1) mHealth-based self-management intervention, (2) paper-based self-management intervention, and (3) contact-control intervention. Participants in all 3 groups met in person once and received 3 follow-up phone calls with a trained graduate assistant. Participants in the mHealth-based and paper-based groups received a computer tablet or a paper diary, respectively, to facilitate goal setting, self-monitoring, and action planning. Participants in the contact-control group received information on healthy behaviors without being taught skills to change behaviors. The following outcomes were measured at baseline and at the 7th week: physical activity (Physical Activity and Disability Survey-revised), psychosocial factors (self-efficacy, self-regulation, and social support), and physical function (Patient Report Outcomes Measurement Information System, 6-min walk test, 1-min chair stands, and 1-min arm curls). RESULTS: Repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated significant differences between groups in physical activity levels (Wilks lambda=0.71, F<sub>6,76</sub>=2.34, P=.04). Both the mHealth-based and paper-based groups had large effect size increases in planned exercise and leisure-time physical activity compared with the contact-control group (Cohen d=1.20 and d=0.82, respectively). Repeated-measures MANOVA indicated nonsignificant differences between groups in psychosocial factors (Wilks lambda=0.85, F<sub>6,76</sub>=1.10, P=.37). However, both the mHealth-based and paper-based groups had moderate effect size improvements in self-efficacy (d=0.48 and d=0.75, respectively) and self-regulation (d=0.59 and d=0.43, respectively) compared with the contact-control group. Repeated-measures MANOVA indicated nonsignificant differences between groups in physical function (Wilks lambda=0.94, F<sub>8,66</sub>=0.27, P=.97). There were small and nonsignificant changes between the mHealth-based and paper-based groups with regard to most outcomes. However, the mHealth-based group had moderate effect size increases (d=0.47) in planned exercise and leisure-time physical activity compared with the paper-based group. CONCLUSIONS: We found that using commercially available mHealth apps in a self-management intervention shows promise in promoting physical activity among adults with musculoskeletal and neurological conditions. Further research is needed to identify the best ways of using commercially available mobile apps in self-management interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: University students in the United Kingdom are experiencing increasing levels of anxiety. A program designed to increase awareness of one's present levels of well‐being and suggest personalized health behaviors may reduce anxiety and improve mental well‐being in students. The efficacy of a digital version of such a program, providing biofeedback and therapeutic content based on personalized well‐being metrics, is reported here. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy and sustained effects of using a mobile app (BioBase) and paired wearable device (BioBeam), compared with a waitlist control group, on anxiety and well‐being in university students with elevated levels of anxiety and stress. METHODS: The study employed a randomized, waitlist‐controlled trial with assessments at baseline, 2 weeks, postintervention (4 weeks), and follow‐up (6 weeks). Participants were eligible if they were current full‐time undergraduate students and (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) scored >14 points on the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale‐21 items (DASS‐21) stress subscale or >7 points on the DASS‐21 anxiety subscale, (3) owned an iOS mobile phone, (4) did not have any previous psychiatric or neurological conditions, (6) were not pregnant at the time of testing, and (7) were able to read and understand English. Participants were encouraged to use BioBase daily and complete at least one course of therapeutic content. A P value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We found that a 4‐week intervention with the BioBase program significantly reduced anxiety and increased perceived well‐being, with sustained effects at a 2‐week follow‐up. Furthermore, a significant reduction in depression levels was found following the 4‐week usage of BioBase. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the efficacy of a biofeedback digital intervention in reducing self‐reported anxiety and increasing perceived well‐being in UK university students. Results suggest that digital mental health interventions could constitute a novel approach to treat stress and anxiety in students, which could be combined or integrated with existing therapeutic pathways.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated the feasibility of a 10‐week program combining a smartphone application and theoretically‐based, social media‐delivered health education intervention to improve college students' health behaviors and outcomes. Participants: Forty‐four college students (32 female; XÌ…age=21.6â€‰years) in 2015‐2016. Methods: Participants were randomized into one of two groups: (1) experimental: used MapMyFitness smartphone application to log and track physical activity (PA) and participated in a Social Cognitive Theory‐based, Facebook‐delivered health education intervention; (2) comparison: only included in a separate, but content‐identical, Facebook intervention. Our primary outcomes pertained to intervention feasibility while our secondary outcomes reflected health behaviors and outcomes. Results: Intervention interest was high, with retention 95.5%. Experimental participants used MapMyFitness 1.71x/week, with both groups implementing the Facebook‐delivered health education tips 1‐3x/week. We observed a modest sedentary behavior reduction in the experimental group (‐29.2‐minutes/day). Additionally, both groups demonstrated slight reductions in weight (experimental:‐1.2â€‰kg/comparison:‐0.6â€‰kg) and body fat percentage (both groups:‐0.8%‐decrease). Increased PA‐related social support and decreased barriers were observed. Conclusions: A low‐burden and well‐integrated social media‐based intervention is feasible and of interest to college students, possibly improving select health behaviors and outcomes. PA‐oriented smartphone application offered limited additional benefit.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of two approaches to using the PTSD Coach mobile application in primary care: Self‐Managed PTSD Coach and Clinician‐Supported PTSD Coach. This study also aims to gather preliminary data to investigate if clinician support improves the benefits of using PTSD Coach on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity and specialty mental healthcare utilization. Method: Twenty primary care veterans with PTSD symptoms were randomized to either Self‐Managed PTSD Coach consisting of one 10‐min session providing instructions for application use or Clinician‐Supported PTSD Coach consisting of four 20‐min sessions focused on setting symptom reduction goals and helping veterans fully engage with application content. Results: Research procedures and intervention conditions appear feasible as indicated by high rates of assessment and intervention retention and high clinician fidelity and satisfaction. Both treatments resulted in reductions in PTSD symptoms, with 7 Clinician‐Supported PTSD Coach and 3 Self‐Managed PTSD Coach participants reporting clinically significant improvements. Clinician‐Supported PTSD Coach resulted in more specialty PTSD care use postintervention and possibly greater reductions in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Both PTSD Coach interventions are feasible and potentially helpful. The addition of clinician support appears to increase the effectiveness of self‐management alone. A larger‐scale randomized controlled trial is warranted to confirm these encouraging preliminary findings.

AB  - Objective(s): This study explored the feasibility, acceptability, preliminary impact, and functionality of two risk reduction mobile application (app) interventions on asthma outcomes as compared to a control arm during wildfire season. Design: Three‐arm, 8‐week randomized clinical trial. Sample: Sixty‐seven young adults with asthma were enrolled. Measurements: The Asthma Control Test, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the System Usability Scale were measured at baseline, 4, and 8�weeks. The Research Attitude Scale was administered at 8 weeks. Twenty participants from the two intervention arms completed an optional survey and six were interviewed after completing the study. Intervention: Both intervention arms could access Smoke Sense Urbanova, an app that supports reducing risks from breathing wildfire smoke. The Smoke Sense Urbanova Plus arm also monitored their daily FEV1, received air quality notifications, and accessed preventive tips and a message board. Results: Most participants agreed the app and spirometer were usable and their privacy and confidentiality were maintained. No adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Participant‐identified recommendations will support intervention refinement and testing. This research supports asthma self‐management tools that public health nurses and community health workers can recommend for at‐risk populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most people with mental health disorders fail to receive timely access to adequate care. US Hispanic/Latino individuals are particularly underrepresented in mental health care and are historically a very difficult population to recruit into clinical trials; however, they have increasing access to mobile technology, with over 75% owning a smartphone. This technology has the potential to overcome known barriers to accessing and utilizing traditional assessment and treatment approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare recruitment and engagement in a fully remote trial of individuals with depression who either self‐identify as Hispanic/Latino or not. A secondary aim was to assess treatment outcomes in these individuals using three different self‐guided mobile apps: iPST (based on evidence‐based therapeutic principles from problem‐solving therapy, PST), Project Evolution (EVO; a cognitive training app based on cognitive neuroscience principles), and health tips (a health information app that served as an information control). METHODS: We recruited Spanish and English speaking participants through social media platforms, internet‐based advertisements, and traditional fliers in select locations in each state across the United States. Assessment and self‐guided treatment was conducted on each participant's smartphone or tablet. We enrolled 389 Hispanic/Latino and 637 non‐Hispanic/Latino adults with mild to moderate depression as determined by Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9) score≥5 or related functional impairment. Participants were first asked about their preferences among the three apps and then randomized to their top two choices. Outcomes were depressive symptom severity (measured using PHQ‐9) and functional impairment (assessed with Sheehan Disability Scale), collected over 3 months. Engagement in the study was assessed based on the number of times participants completed active surveys. RESULTS: We screened 4502 participants and enrolled 1040 participants from throughout the United States over 6 months, yielding a sample of 348 active users. Long‐term engagement surfaced as a key issue among Hispanic/Latino participants, who dropped from the study 2 weeks earlier than their non‐Hispanic/Latino counterparts (P<.02). No significant differences were observed for treatment outcomes between those identifying as Hispanic/Latino or not. Although depressive symptoms improved (beta=‐2.66, P=.006) over the treatment course, outcomes did not vary by treatment app. CONCLUSIONS: Fully remote mobile‐based studies can attract a diverse participant pool including people from traditionally underserved communities in mental health care and research (here, Hispanic/Latino individuals). However, keeping participants engaged in this type of "low‐touch" research study remains challenging. Hispanic/Latino populations may be less willing to use mobile apps for assessing and managing depression. Future research endeavors should use a user‐centered design to determine the role of mobile apps in the assessment and treatment of depression for this population, app features they would be interested in using, and strategies for long‐term engagement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about pain and opiate use at home directly after total knee replacement (TKR). Due to adverse effects, low opiate use is desired. An electronic health app (PainCoach) was developed to guide patients in pain control and opiate use. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of the PainCoach app on pain control and opiate use in patients who underwent TKR during the first 2 weeks at home after surgery. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, patients scheduled for TKR were offline recruited and randomized to a PainCoach group or control group. In the PainCoach group, the PainCoach app was downloaded on each patient's smartphone or tablet. In response to the patient's input of the pain experienced, the PainCoach app gave advice on pain medication use, exercises/rest, and when to call the clinic. This advice was the same as that received during usual care. The control group received usual care. The primary outcomes were opiate use and visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores at rest, during activity, and at night during the first 2 weeks at home after surgery, which were collected daily from day 1 until 14 postoperatively by online questionnaires. The actual amount of app use was recorded, and active use was defined as â‰¥12 total app uses. RESULTS: The pain scores did not differ between the groups. The PainCoach group (n=38) used 23.2% less opiates (95% CI ‐38.3 to ‐4.4; P=.02) and 14.6% more acetaminophen (95% CI 8.2‐21.3; P<.001) when compared with the findings in the control group (n=33). The PainCoach app was used 12 (IQR 4.5‐22.0) times per patient. In the active PainCoach subgroup (n=19), the following were noted when compared with the findings in the control group: 4.1 times faster reduction of the VAS pain score during activity (95% CI ‐7.5 to ‐0.8; P=.02), 6.3 times faster reduction of the VAS pain score at night (95% CI ‐10.1 to ‐2.6; P=.001), 44.3% less opiate use (95% CI ‐59.4 to ‐23.5; P<.001), 76.3% less gabapentin use (95% CI ‐86.0 to ‐59.8; P<.001), and 21.0% more acetaminophen use (95% CI 12.6‐30.0; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of the PainCoach app contributes to reduced opiate use in the initial period at home after TKR. Active use of this app leads to a further reduction in opiate use and improved pain control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03961152; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03961152.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of apps to tackle overweight and obesity by tracking physical and dietary patterns and providing recommendations and motivation strategies to achieve personalized goals has increased over recent years. However, evidence of the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of these apps is severely lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify efficacy, safety, and effectiveness criteria used to assess weight control, overweight, and obesity management in mobile health (mHealth) interventions through a systematic review. METHODS: PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, UK Trial Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library were surveyed up to May 2018. All types of clinical studies were considered. A total of 2 independent reviewers assessed quality using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria. Ratings were used to provide an overall score for each study (low, moderate, or high). Data were synthesized in evidence tables. RESULTS: From 233 potentially relevant publications, only 28 studies were included. Of these, 13 (46%) were randomized control trials, 11 were single-arm studies (39%), 3 were nonrandomized controlled trials (11%), and 1 study was a cluster randomized trial (4%). The studies were classified as low (15), high (7), and moderate (6) quality according to SIGN criteria. All studies focused on efficacy, with only 1 trial mentioning safety and another 1 effectiveness. In 11 studies, the apps were used as stand-alone interventions, the others were multicomponent studies that included other tools for support such as sensors or websites. The main management tool included in the apps was feedback messaging (24), followed by goal-setting mechanisms (20) and self-monitoring (19). The majority of studies took weight or body mass index loss as the main outcome (22) followed by changes in physical activity (14) and diet (12). Regarding outputs, usability, adherence, and engagement (17) were the most reported, followed by satisfaction (7) and acceptability (4). CONCLUSIONS: There is a remarkable heterogeneity among these studies and the majority have methodological limitations that leave considerable room for improvement. Further research is required to identify all relevant criteria for assessing the efficacy of mHealth interventions in the management of overweight and obesity.

AB  - Background: Non‐communicable disease has become a public health concern and is associated with an unhealthy lifestyle and aging. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effect of M‐Health Application: “CHICKEN LOF” on lipid profile and body composition in healthcare workers with dyslipidemia. Methods: This study was a randomized controlled trial conducted on 80 full‐time healthcare workers having dyslipidemia from Phuket City Hospital. Participants were randomly assigned by a computer generator into an intervention group and control group. The intervention group received “CHICKEN LOF”: M‐Health Application and usual care, and the control group received only usual care. Outcomes were measured on days 30, 60, 90 and compared to baseline. Results: The mean age was 33.9 years in the intervention group and 33.2 years in the control group. The baseline characteristics were not statistically or significantly different. However, significant changes were observed in intervention group regarding total knowledge (p<0.001), total attitude (p=0.001), total practice (p<0.001), HDL‐C (p=0.002), weight (p<0.001), BMI (p=0.001), body fat percentage (p=0.029), bone mass (p=0.030), BMR (p=0.032) and total body water (p=0.027). In pairwise comparison, a significant increase in knowledge, attitude and practice was found from the baseline to day 30, 60 and 90, respectively. Conclusion: In the present study, CHICKEN‐LOF mobile application was found to be effective in terms of knowledge, attitude and practice, and contributed to improving lipid and body composition. This study suggests a longer term implementation to evaluate sustainability not only in the healthcare setting but also in the community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of adults across the globe with significant depressive symptoms has grown substantially during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The extant literature supports exercise as a potent behaviour that can significantly reduce depressive symptoms in clinical and non‐clinical populations. OBJECTIVE: Using a suite of mobile applications, at‐home exercise, including high intensity interval training (HIIT) and/or yoga, was completed to reduce depressive symptoms in the general population in the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: A 6‐week, parallel, multiarm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was completed with four groups: (1) HIIT, (2) Yoga, (3) HIIT+yoga, and (4) waitlist control (WLC). Low active, English‐speaking, non‐retired Canadians aged 18‐64 years were included. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and weekly following randomisation. RESULTS: A total of 334 participants were randomised to one of four groups. No differences in depressive symptoms were evident at baseline. The results of latent growth modelling showed significant treatment effects in depressive symptoms for each active group compared with the WLC, with small effect sizes (ESs) in the community‐based sample of participants. Treatment groups were not significantly different from each other. Effect sizes were very large (eg, week 6 ES range=‐2.34 to ‐2.52) when restricting the analysis only to participants with high depressive symptoms at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: At‐home exercise is a potent behaviour to improve mental health in adults during the pandemic, especially in those with increased levels of depressive symptoms. Promotion of at‐home exercise may be a global public health target with important personal, social and economic implications as the world emerges scathed by the pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
To test whether adding mobile application coaching and patient/provider web portals to community primary care compared with standard diabetes management would reduce glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A cluster-randomized clinical trial, the Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study, randomly assigned 26 primary care practices to one of three stepped treatment groups or a control group (usual care). A total of 163 patients were enrolled and included in analysis. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin levels over a 1-year treatment period. Secondary outcomes were changes in patient-reported diabetes symptoms, diabetes distress, depression, and other clinical (blood pressure) and laboratory (lipid) values. Maximal treatment was a mobile- and web-based self-management patient coaching system and provider decision support. Patients received automated, real-time educational and behavioral messaging in response to individually analyzed blood glucose values, diabetes medications, and lifestyle behaviors communicated by mobile phone. Providers received quarterly reports summarizing patient’s glycemic control, diabetes medication management, lifestyle behaviors, and evidence-based treatment options.

RESULTS
The mean declines in glycated hemoglobin were 1.9% in the maximal treatment group and 0.7% in the usual care group, a difference of 1.2% (P = 0.001) over 12 months. Appreciable differences were not observed between groups for patient-reported diabetes distress, depression, diabetes symptoms, or blood pressure and lipid levels (all P > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS
The combination of behavioral mobile coaching with blood glucose data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient self-management data individually analyzed and presented with evidence-based guidelines to providers substantially reduced glycated hemoglobin levels over 1 year.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users' behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement. OBJECTIVE: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions. METHODS: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions. RESULTS: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A diet high in fermentable, oligo‐, di‐, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) has been shown to exacerbate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous literature reports significant improvement in IBS symptoms with initiation of a low FODMAP diet (LFD) and monitored reintroduction. However, dietary adherence to the LFD is difficult, with patients stating that the information given by health care providers is often generalized and nonspecific, requiring them to search for supplementary information to fit their needs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine whether Heali, a novel artificial intelligence dietary mobile app can improve adherence to the LFD, IBS symptom severity, and quality of life outcomes in adults with IBS or IBS‐like symptoms over a 4‐week period. METHODS: Participants were randomized into 2 groups: the control group (CON), in which participants received educational materials, and the experimental group (APP), in which participants received access to the mobile app and educational materials. Over the course of this unblinded online trial, all participants completed a battery of 5 questionnaires at baseline and at the end of the trial to document IBS symptoms, quality of life, LFD knowledge, and LFD adherence. RESULTS: We enrolled 58 participants in the study (29 in each group), and 25 participants completed the study in its entirety (11 and 14 for the CON and APP groups, respectively). Final, per‐protocol analyses showed greater improvement in quality of life score for the APP group compared to the CON group (31.1 and 11.8, respectively; P=.04). Reduction in total IBS symptom severity score was 24% greater for the APP group versus the CON group. Although this did not achieve significance (‐170 vs ‐138 respectively; P=.37), the reduction in the subscore for bowel habit dissatisfaction was 2‐fold greater for the APP group than for the CON group (P=.05). CONCLUSIONS: This initial study provides preliminary evidence that Heali may provide therapeutic benefit to its users, specifically improvements in quality of life and bowel habits. Although this study was underpowered, findings from this study warrant further research in a larger sample of participants to test the efficacy of Heali app use to improve outcomes for patients with IBS.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to investigate the effectiveness of the lower limb rehabilitation protocol (LLRP) combined with mobile health (mHealth) applications on knee pain, mobility, functional activity and activities of daily living (ADL) among knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients who were overweight and obese. Methods: This study was a single‐blind, RCT conducted at Teaching Bay of Rehmatul‐Lil‐Alameen Post Graduate Institute of Cardiology between February and November 2020. 114 knee OA patients who were overweight and obese were randomly divided by a computer‐generated number into the rehabilitation group with mHealth (RGw‐mHealth) to receive LLRP + instructions of daily care (IDC) combined with mHealth intervention, rehabilitation group without mHealth (RGwo‐mHealth) to receive LLRP + IDC intervention and control group (CG) to receive IDC intervention. All three groups were also provided leaflets explaining about their intervention. The primary outcome measure was knee pain measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score. The secondary outcome measures were mobility measured by the Timed up and go (TUG) test, functional activity measured by the patient‐specific functional scale (PSFS), and ADL measured by the Katz Index of independence in ADL scores. Results: Among the 114 patients who were randomized (mean age, 53�years), 96 (84%) completed the trial. After 3‐months of intervention, patients in all three groups had statistically significant knee pain reduction (RGw‐mHealth: 2.54; RGwo‐mHealth: 1.47; and CG: 0.37) within groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients in the RGw‐mHealth and RGwo‐mHealth had statistically significant improvement in mobility, functional activity, and ADL within groups (P < 0.05), but no improvement was noted in the CG (p > 0.05). As indicated in the overall analysis of covariance, there were statistically significant differences in the mean knee pain, mobility, functional activity, and ADL changes between groups after 3‐months (p < 0.001). The pairwise between‐group comparisons (Bonferroni post hoc analysis) of the knee pain, mobility, functional activity, and ADL scores at 3‐months revealed that patients in the RGw‐mHealth had significantly higher mean change in the knee pain, TUG test, functional activity, and ADL scores compared to patients in the RGwo‐mHealth or CG. Conclusion: Reduction in knee pain, improvement in mobility, functional activity, and ADL were more among patients in the RGw‐mHealth compared with the RGwo‐mHealth or CG.

AB  - This study examined feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth facilitated health coaching antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence intervention. Persons living with HIV (n = 53) were randomized to an in‐person adherence session and 12 months of app access and health coaching via the app (Fitbit Plus) versus single adherence session (SOC). At baseline and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, we measured ART adherence, substance use, and depressive symptoms. We also conducted individual qualitative interviews. The intervention was found to be largely feasible and highly acceptable, with the health coach spending an average of 2.4 min per month with a participant and 76.5% of Fitbit Plus participants using the app regularly at 12 months. While most comparisons were not significant, the pattern of results was consistent with better adherence in the Fitbit Plus compared to SOC condition. Substance use was significantly associated with poorer ART adherence while depressive symptoms were not.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02676128; Registered: 2/8/2016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in its basic principle has developed itself as a stand-alone, substantial method of therapy. With effective application in therapy for a range of mental health issues, the spread of CBT methods to Web-based therapy sources is evident. The development of mobile phone apps using CBT principles is increasing within the research area. Despite the move to Web-based methods of therapy, it is argued that these methods lack the same efficacy of face-to-face therapy sessions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess extent research findings with regard to the effectiveness of CBT-related mobile health (mHealth) apps. By assessing only studies employing a randomized controlled trial design, the review aimed to determine app efficacy within the highly regarded method of investigation. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across several databases. Search results were filtered, and results were subject to strict inclusion and exclusion criteria because of the nature of the review. Where possible, analysis of effect size was calculated and results reported. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies investigating the effectiveness of mHealth CBT-related apps across a range of mental health issues were reviewed. Three studies used the app against a control group, and 5 studies used the app intervention against another form of treatment or intervention. A range of effect sizes were seen across all included studies (d=-0.13 to 1.83; 0.03-1.44), with the largest effects often being seen when comparing the data from pre- to posttest for the app engaged group. CONCLUSIONS: The studies reviewed support the use of mHealth apps containing CBT principles for a range of mental health issues. However, the effectiveness over longer time periods should be assessed. Researchers and professionals should seek to collaborate effectively when creating new apps to enhance their effectiveness as a treatment for the general public.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The initial introduction of the World Wide Web in 1990 brought around the biggest change in information acquisition. Due to the abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic. A substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily available to download concerning a wide range of health issues. mHealth has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments; eradicate the need to meet in person with a clinician, successively diminishing the workload of mental health professionals; be more cost effective to practices; and encourage self-care tactics. Previous research has given valid evidence with empirical studies proving the effectiveness of physical and mental health interventions using mobile apps. Alongside apps, there is evidence to show that receiving short message service (SMS) messages, which entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a patient's mental and physical well-being. Available mHealth apps and SMS services and their ever improving quality necessitates a systematic review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence to intervention, and usability. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to study the efficacy, usability, and feasibility of mobile apps and SMS messages as mHealth interventions for self-guided care. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in JMIR, PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and SAGE. The search spanned from January 2008 to January 2017. The primary outcome measures consisted of weight management, (pregnancy) smoking cessation, medication adherence, depression, anxiety and stress. Where possible, adherence, feasibility, and usability outcomes of the apps or SMS services were evaluated. Between-group and within-group effect sizes (Cohen d) for the mHealth intervention method group were determined. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies, inclusive of 4658 participants were reviewed. The papers included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=19), within-group studies (n=7), and 1 within-group study with qualitative aspect. Studies show improvement in physical health and significant reductions of anxiety, stress, and depression. Within-group and between-group effect sizes ranged from 0.05-3.37 (immediately posttest), 0.05-3.25 (1-month follow-up), 0.08-3.08 (2-month follow-up), 0.00-3.10 (3-month follow-up), and 0.02-0.27 (6-month follow-up). Usability and feasibility of mHealth interventions, where reported, also gave promising, significant results. CONCLUSIONS: The review shows the promising and emerging efficacy of using mobile apps and SMS text messaging as mHealth interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor sleep health is highly prevalent. Physical activity is known to improve sleep quality but not specifically targeted in sleep interventions. PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of a combined physical activity and sleep intervention with a sleep‐only intervention and a wait‐list control, for improving sleep quality in middle‐aged adults without a diagnosed sleep disorder. METHODS: Three‐arm randomized controlled trial (Physical Activity and Sleep Health (PAS), Sleep Health Only (SO), Wait‐list Control (CON) groups; 3‐month primary time‐point, 6‐month follow‐up) of 275 (PAS = 110, SO = 110, CON = 55) inactive adults (40‐65 years) reporting poor sleep quality. The main intervention component was a smartphone/tablet "app" to aid goal setting and self‐monitoring physical activity and/or sleep hygiene behaviors (including stress management), and a pedometer for PAS group. Primary outcome was Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) global score. Secondary outcomes included several self‐reported physical activity measures and PSQI subcomponents. Group differences were examined stepwise, first between pooled intervention (PI = PAS + SO) and CON groups, then between PAS and SO groups. RESULTS: Compared with CON, PI groups significantly improved PSQI global and subcomponents scores at 3 and 6 months. There were no differences in sleep quality between PAS and SO groups. The PAS group reported significantly less daily sitting time at 3 months and was significantly more likely to report â‰¥2 days/week resistance training and meeting physical activity guidelines at 6 months than the SO group. CONCLUSIONS: PIs had statistically significantly improved sleep quality among middle‐aged adults with poor sleep quality without a diagnosed sleep disorder. The adjunctive physical activity intervention did not additionally improve sleep quality.

AB  - 243Background: Patients prescribed oral chemotherapy receive minimal supervision and support for adherence. We developed a smartphone mobile app consisting of medication reminders, symptom reporting, clinician communication, and educational resources for improving adherence and symptom management. In this study, we sought to identify potential correlates of app usage. Methods: From 12/2014 to 08/2016, 181 patients with diverse malignancies prescribed oral chemotherapy enrolled in a randomized trial to test the efficacy of a smartphone mobile app to improve adherence and symptoms. Medication adherence was monitored using electronic pill caps (MEMScaps). At baseline and 12 weeks, participants completed a measure of treatment satisfaction (FACIT-TS). We gathered clinical and treatment data from the electronic health record. Through the app we collected data on engagement: total number of minutes, days of usage, and number of completed symptom reports. We calculated Pearson correlations to identify associatio...

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of mobile phone apps for improving lifestyles has become generalized in the population, although little is still known about their effectiveness in improving health. OBJECTIVE: We evaluate the effect of adding an app to standard counseling on increased physical activity (PA) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet, 3 months after implementation. METHODS: A randomized, multicenter clinical trial was carried out. A total of 833 participants were recruited in six primary care centers in Spain through random sampling: 415 in the app+counseling group and 418 in the counseling only group. Counseling on PA and the Mediterranean diet was given to both groups. The app+counseling participants additionally received training in the use of an app designed to promote PA and the Mediterranean diet over a 3‐month period. PA was measured with the 7‐day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) questionnaire and an accelerometer; adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly female in both the app+counseling (249/415, 60.0%) and counseling only (268/418, 64.1%) groups, with a mean age of 51.4 (SD 12.1) and 52.3 (SD 12.0) years, respectively. Leisure‐time moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) by 7‐day PAR increased in the app+counseling (mean 29, 95% CI 5‐53 min/week; P=.02) but not in the counseling only group (mean 17.4, 95% CI ‐18 to 53 min/week; P=.38). No differences in increase of activity were found between the two groups. The accelerometer recorded a decrease in PA after 3 months in both groups: MVPA mean ‐55.3 (95% CI ‐75.8 to ‐34.9) min/week in app+counseling group and mean ‐30.1 (95% CI ‐51.8 to ‐8.4) min/week in counseling only group. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet increased in both groups (8.4% in app+counseling and 10.4% in counseling only group), with an increase in score of 0.42 and 0.53 points, respectively (P<.001), but no difference between groups (P=.86). CONCLUSIONS: Leisure‐time MVPA increased more in the app+counseling than counseling only group, although no difference was found when comparing the increase between the two groups. Counseling accompanied by printed materials appears to be effective in improving adherence to the Mediterranean diet, although the app does not increase adherence.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate the effects of an intervention that comprised a brief counseling session on lifestyle habits together with the use of the EVIDENT (Lifestyles and arterial aging) application on the modification of markers that indicated different hemodynamic functions, such as arterial stiffness, blood pressure or wave reflections. The EVIDENT II study (Lifestyles and arterial aging) is a randomized clinical trial with two parallel groups. Each participant had an initial visit and two follow‐up visits at 3 and 12 months where the peripheral augmentation index‐PAIx75 was measured by tonometry, while an oscillometric method was used for the cardio‐ankle vascular index‐CAVI and brachial‐ankle pulse wave velocity‐baPWV. Both groups (intervention‐IG and control‐CG) were briefly counseled on diet and exercise. The IG also received instructions on the use of the EVIDENT II application during the 3 months. The sample (N = 597; 52 ± 11 years; 64% women) was randomized into IG = 291 and CG = 306. Comparing groups, there was a decrease in the PAIx75 favorable to the IG at 3 months (‐4.9%, 95% CI: ‐7.7 to ‐2.1) and 12 months (‐3.9%, 95% CI: ‐6.8 to ‐1.0). There was also a nonsignificant reduction of the CAVI at 3 months in the IG. A group effect was observed in the measurement of the PAIx75 over the 12‐month follow‐up (p = 0.003). This interaction was only observed in women (p = 0.017). In conclusion, the use of the EVIDENT II application achieved a modification of the PAIx75, a marker of wave reflection and vascular tone, in women through lifestyle improvements (physical activity and adherence to the Mediterranean diet). No significant results were found regarding blood pressure or arterial stiffness markers.

AB  - Digital health applications (apps) have the potential to improve health behaviors and outcomes. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a consumer web‐based app linked to primary care electronic health records (EHRs). CONNECT was a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) recruited from primary care (Clinical Trial registration ACTRN12613000715774). Intervention participants received an interactive app which was pre‐populated and refreshed with EHR risk factor data, diagnoses and, medications. Interactive risk calculators, motivational messages and lifestyle goal tracking were also included. Control group received usual health care. Primary outcome was adherence to guideline‐recommended medications (≥80% of days covered for blood pressure (BP) and statin medications). Secondary outcomes included attainment of risk factor targets and eHealth literacy. In total, 934 patients were recruited; mean age 67.6 (±8.1) years. At 12 months, the proportion with >80% days covered with recommended medicines was low overall and there was no difference between the groups (32.8% vs. 29.9%; relative risk [RR] 1.07 [95% CI, 0.88–1.20] p = 0.49). There was borderline improvement in the proportion meeting BP and LDL targets in intervention vs. control (17.1% vs. 12.1% RR 1.40 [95% CI, 0.97–2.03] p = 0.07). The intervention was associated with increased attainment of physical activity targets (87.0% intervention vs. 79.7% control, p = 0.02) and e‐health literacy scores (72.6% intervention vs. 64.0% control, p = 0.02). In conclusion, a consumer app integrated with primary health care EHRs was not effective in increasing medication adherence. Borderline improvements in risk factors and modest behavior changes were observed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Smartphone-based smoking cessation interventions are increasingly used around the world. However, the effects of smartphone applications on applicability and efficacy on cessation rate and prevention of relapses are not often evaluated. Therefore, this review aims to assess the evidence on effectiveness of smartphone applications as an intervention tool for smoking cessation support. METHODS: We conducted the search using Ovid Medline/PubMed, CENTRAL and Scopus databases dated (January 2007-June 2016). Inclusion criteria include randomized control trials or intervention studies with mobile applications that offer smoking cessation support. Two assessors independently extracted and evaluated the data from each included study. RESULTS: The review of eight selected studies illustrate the use of smartphone applications in increasing quit rates among smokers, however adherence to app features influences quit rates. Audiovisual features followed by a quit plan, tracking progress and sharing features are most accepted and utilised app features. However, inconsistency was observed in their association with abstinence or quit rate. App engagement features increase the statistical significance in the quit rate. Development of smartphone applications was supported by behavior change theories in all studies nevertheless; heterogeneous forms of intervention were adopted within studies. Similarly, reduction in relapse attributed to enhanced discussion among quitters using social media applications was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Quality evidence is warranted with large sample size to measure effect size of the intervention. Future research on effectiveness and efficacy of smartphone alone and comparisons with other mHealth interventions, such as text messaging would be useful.

AB  - This quantitative study investigated the effects of Computerized-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CCBT) and Mindfulness-Based Mobile App (MBMA) on job stress and anxiety in active-duty military students. This study's goal was to learn how future soldiers respond to early therapeutic interventions prior to any combat exposure or diagnosis of PTSD. Two-hundred St. Leo University active-duty military students were randomly assigned to CCBT and MBMA, to reduce job stress and anxiety. Instruments used in this study were the MBI to measure job stress related to military duty pre and posttest and the BAI scale to measure anxiety. It was hypothesized; active duty military students receiving the CCBT are more likely to experience a reduction in job stress and anxiety than active duty military students receiving MBMA. Male active duty military students in both treatments are more likely to experience a reduction in job stress and anxiety compared to female active duty military students. Caucasian active duty military students in both treatments are more likely to experience a reduction in job stress and anxiety compared to African American active duty military students. Results concluded that both groups experienced equally healthy clinical benefits, job stress and anxiety were reduced equally across gender in both treatment groups, Caucasians experienced an 11 percent reduction in job stress compared to African Americans and participants who identified as Marine experienced a 15 percent reduction in job stress.

AB  - Technological interventions specifically, mobile health application have risen dramatically. Individuals prefer to seek support from a mobile health application, which can serve to be effective in delivering health promotion initiatives and interventions. Therefore, we aimed to assess the available mobile “apps” for smoking and obesity by conducting a systematic review of current mobile “app” controlled interventions. Research articles published between 2006 and 2013 were considered, seven research papers were included within the review. An introduction and overview of the current research available in understanding the efficacy and development of mobile health ‘apps’ was outlined. In conclusion this review proposes the need for more comprehensive research within this area. Publishing accurate findings will provide good basis for understanding if smoking or obesity can be altered and supported through smartphone mobile application. Mobile technology has the potential to reach millions, with the on-going development of new innovative phones, offering health promotion and intervention through this portal is the future.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact on stress and work‐related outcomes of an app‐delivered mindfulness‐based program (MBP; Headspace®) offered to employees in a UK higher education (HE) institution. Design/methodology/approach: Using a randomized waitlist control trial design, participants were randomly allocated to be offered a mindfulness‐based program (MBP) immediately for 2 months or after a waiting list period of 2 months (WLC). Data were analyzed using Intention to Treat (ITT; MBP n = 62; WLC n = 63); with supplementary analysis restricting to those who completed all measures; (MBP n = 45; WLC n = 56) and then further restricting the MBP group to those who completed at least foundation level 1 of the app; (MBP n = 31; WLC n = 56). Findings: The ITT analysis showed significant increases in several aspects of mindfulness and a significant reduction in perceived stress but no significant effects for work‐related outcomes. Analysis restricted to MBP participants who completed the app foundation course showed a similar pattern but in addition showed significant increases in work‐life balance and the emotional aspect of job engagement. Practical implications: The offer of the Headspace® app in the HE sector may result in reduced perceived stress. If improvements in work‐related outcomes are also to be seen, then users need to be encouraged to complete a minimum level of practice. Originality/value: Effect size estimates for stress and work‐related outcomes of an app‐delivered MBP contribute to the evolving picture of MBPs in the workplace.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phone health apps are increasingly gaining attention in oncological care as potential tools for supporting cancer patients. Although the number of publications and health apps focusing on cancer is increasing, there are still few specifically designed for the most prevalent cancers diagnosed: breast and prostate cancers. There is a need to review the effect of these apps on breast and prostate cancer patients' quality of life (QoL) and well-being. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to review the scientific literature on mobile phone apps targeting breast or prostate cancer patients and involving QoL and well-being (anxiety and depression symptoms) and analyze the clinical and technological characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of these apps, as well as patients' user experience with them. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from The Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica Database, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE to identify studies involving apps focused on breast and/or prostate cancer patients and QoL and/or well-being published between January 1, 2000, and July 12, 2017. Only trial studies which met the inclusion criteria were selected. The systematic review was completed with a critical analysis of the apps previously identified in the health literature research that were available from the official app stores. RESULTS: The systematic review of the literature yielded 3862 articles. After removal of duplicates, 3229 remained and were evaluated on the basis of title and abstract. Of these, 3211 were discarded as not meeting the inclusion criteria, and 18 records were selected for full text screening. Finally, 5 citations were included in this review, with a total of 644 patients, mean age 52.16 years. Four studies targeted breast cancer patients and 1 focused on prostate cancer patients. Four studies referred to apps that assessed QoL. Only 1 among the 5 analyzed apps was available from the official app store. In 3 studies, an app-related intervention was carried out, and 2 of them reported an improvement on QoL. The lengths of the app-related interventions varied from 4 to 12 weeks. Because 2 of the studies only tracked use of the app, no effect on QoL or well-being was found. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the existence of hundreds of studies involving cancer-focused mobile phone apps, there is a lack of rigorous trials regarding the QoL and/or well-being assessment in breast and/or prostate cancer patients. A strong and collective effort should be made by all health care providers to determine those cancer-focused apps that effectively represent useful, accurate, and reliable tools for cancer patients' disease management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive and behavioral symptoms are the clinical hallmarks of neurocognitive disorders. Cognitive training may be offered to reduce the risks of cognitive decline and dementia and to reduce behavioral symptoms, such as apathy. Information and communication technology approaches, including serious games, can be useful in improving the playful aspect of computerized cognitive training and providing motivating solutions in elderly patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of employing the MeMo (Memory Motivation) Web app with regard to cognitive and behavioral symptoms in patients with neurocognitive disorders. METHODS: MeMo is a Web app that can be used on any Web browser (computer or tablet). The training activities proposed in MeMo are divided into the following two parts: memory and mental flexibility/attention. The study included 46 individuals (mean age 79.4 years) with a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders at the Institut Claude Pompidou Memory Center in Nice. This randomized controlled study compared the evolution of cognition and behavior between patients not using MeMo (control group) and patients using MeMo (MeMo group) for 12 weeks (four sessions per week). Patients underwent memory and attention tests, as well as an apathy assessment at baseline, week 12 (end of the training period), and week 24 (12 weeks after the end of the training sessions). In addition, to assess the impact of high and low game uses, the MeMo group was divided into patients who used MeMo according to the instructions (about once every 2 days; active MeMo group) and those who used it less (nonactive MeMo group). RESULTS: When comparing cognitive and behavioral scores among baseline, week 12, and week 24, mixed model analysis for each cognitive and behavioral score indicated no significant interaction between testing time and group. On comparing the active MeMo group (n=9) and nonactive MeMo group (n=13), there were significant differences in two attention tests (Trial Making Test A [P=.045] and correct Digit Symbol Substitution Test items [P=.045]) and in the Apathy Inventory (AI) (P=.02). Mixed analysis (time: baseline, week 12, and week 24 Ã— number of active days) indicated only one significant interaction for the AI score (P=.01), with a significant increase in apathy in the nonactive MeMo group. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the cognitive and behavioral efficacies of MeMo, a Web‐based training app, can be observed only with regular use of the app. Improvements were observed in attention and motivation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perception of skin cancer risk, belief that sun protection prevents skin cancer, and having sun protection choices enhance sun protection behaviors by kidney transplant recipients, who are at greater risk of developing skin cancer than the general population. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial used stratified recruitment of non‐Hispanic White, non‐Hispanic Black, and Hispanic/Latino kidney transplant recipients, who received a transplant 2‐24 months prior to the study. The same culturally sensitive SunProtectTM program was delivered to all recipients with tablet personal computers in two urban ambulatory offices. Text messages reminders were provided at two week intervals. Self‐reported surveys and skin pigmentation measured prior to the intervention and six weeks later were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 552 eligible participants, 170 participated (62 non‐Hispanic Whites, 60Blacks, and 48 Hispanics). Among participants receiving the intervention with skin that burns after sun exposure and becomes tan or becomes irritated and gets darker, there was a statistically significant increase in self‐reported knowledge, recognition of personal skin cancer risk, confidence in sun protection preventing skin cancer, and sun protection behaviors in participants compared to those receiving usual education (p<0.05). At the six week follow‐up, participants in the intervention group with skin that burns or becomes irritated, had significantly less darkening of the sun‐exposed forearm than control participants (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Providing sun protection education with SunProtectTM in the springwith reminders during the summer facilitated adoption of sun protection behaviors among kidney transplant recipients with skin that burns or becomes irritated

AB  - The present study was aim to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of a mobile‐health application, CALMA, based on dialectical behavioral therapy skills. CALMA was proposed as an adjunct to therapy for the reduction of non‐suicidal and suicidal self‐injury behaviors. A parallel design was used to compare the intervention group (DBT + CALMA) and the comparison group (DBT). Patients were randomized based on their groups following a randomized cluster design. After treatment, patients completed a follow‐up assessment four weeks later. Each cluster was represented by a different DBT Skills Training Group offered weekly at FORO Foundation for Mental Health. Six DBT Skills Training groups were randomized to the intervention or comparison group. Twenty‐one individuals met inclusion criteria and eighteen were included in the analysis. Acceptability was measured with the User Experience Questionnaire short version (UEQ‐s) and preliminary efficacy with the Self‐injurious thoughts and behaviors interview (SITBI). CALMA shows good acceptability to be used as an adjunct to therapy specific to the reduction of suicidal and non‐suicidal self‐directed violence. Evidence for preliminary efficacy included a high probability of decreased in more behaviors evaluated with the SITBI pre‐ and post‐intervention for the group that received CALMA as compared to the comparison group. Our study provides initial evidence for the effectiveness and acceptability of CALMA. Future studies scaling up this intervention in a larger number of participants are necessary. CALMA may be especially useful in low and middle‐income Latin American countries to improve access to evidence‐based interventions openly available in Spanish and free to download. Highlights CALMA is a DBT‐based app aimed to reduce non‐suicidal and suicidal self‐directed violence. The app showed good acceptability by users A high probability of decrease in suicidal ideation, suicidal plan, suicidal gesture, thoughts about NSSI and NSSI pre‐ and post‐intervention was observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Syrian refugees residing in Germany often develop posttraumatic stress as a result of the Syrian civil war, their escape, and postmigration stressors. At the same time, there is a lack of adequate treatment options. The smartphone‐based app Sanadak was developed to provide cognitive behavioral therapy‐based self‐help in the Arabic language for Syrian refugees with posttraumatic stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of the app. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, eligible individuals were randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG; app use) or control group (CG; psychoeducational reading material). Data were collected during structured face‐to‐face interviews at 3 assessments (preintervention/baseline, postintervention/after 4 weeks, follow‐up/after 4 months). Using adjusted mixed‐effects linear regression models, changes in posttraumatic stress and secondary outcomes were investigated as intention‐to‐treat (ITT) and per‐protocol (PP) analysis. Cost‐effectiveness was evaluated based on adjusted mean total costs, quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost‐effectiveness acceptability curves using the net benefit approach. RESULTS: Of 170 screened individuals (aged 18 to 65 years), 133 were eligible and randomized to the IG (n=65) and CG (n=68). Although there was a pre‐post reduction in posttraumatic stress, ITT showed no significant differences between the IG and CG after 4 weeks (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM‐5, Diff ‐0.90, 95% CI ‐0.24 to 0.47; P=.52) and after 4 months (Diff ‐0.39, 95% CI ‐3.24 to 2.46; P=.79). The same was true for PP. Regarding secondary outcomes, ITT indicated a treatment effect for self‐stigma: after 4 weeks (Self‐Stigma of Mental Illness Scale/SSMIS‐stereotype agreement: d=0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; stereotype application: d=0.60, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99) and after 4 months (d=0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.92; d=0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.90), the IG showed significantly lower values in self‐stigma than the CG. ITT showed no significant group differences in total costs and QALYs. The probability of cost‐effectiveness was 81% for a willingness‐to‐pay of €0 per additional QALY but decreased with increasing willingness‐to‐pay. CONCLUSIONS: Sanadak was not more effective in reducing mild to moderate posttraumatic stress in Syrian refugees than the control condition nor was it likely to be cost‐effective. Therefore, Sanadak is not suitable as a standalone treatment. However, as the app usability was very good, no harms detected, and stigma significantly reduced, Sanadak has potential as a bridging aid within a stepped and collaborative care approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smartphone apps are a promising tool for delivering accessible and appealing physical activity interventions. Given the large growth of research in this field, there are now enough studies using the "gold standard" of experimental design-the randomized controlled trial design-and employing objective measurements of physical activity, to support a meta-analysis of these scientifically rigorous studies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of smartphone apps for increasing objectively measured physical activity in adults. METHODS: A total of 7 electronic databases (EMBASE, EmCare, MEDLINE, Scopus, Sport Discus, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched from 2007 to January 2018. Following the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and Study Design format, studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled trials involving adults, used a smartphone app as the primary or sole component of the physical activity intervention, used a no- or minimal-intervention control condition, and measured objective physical activity either in the form of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes or steps. Study quality was assessed using a 25-item tool based on the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials checklist. A meta-analysis of study effects was conducted using a random effects model approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine whether intervention effectiveness differed on the basis of intervention length, target behavior (physical activity alone vs physical activity in combination with other health behaviors), or target population (general adult population vs specific health populations). RESULTS: Following removal of duplicates, a total of 6170 studies were identified from the original database searches. Of these, 9 studies, involving a total of 1740 participants, met eligibility criteria. Of these, 6 studies could be included in a meta-analysis of the effects of physical activity apps on steps per day. In comparison with the control conditions, smartphone apps produced a nonsignificant (P=.19) increase in participants' average steps per day, with a mean difference of 476.75 steps per day (95% CI -229.57 to 1183.07) between groups. Sensitivity analyses suggested that physical activity programs with a duration of less than 3 months were more effective than apps evaluated across more than 3 months (P=.01), and that physical activity apps that targeted physical activity in isolation were more effective than apps that targeted physical activity in combination with diet (P=.04). Physical activity app effectiveness did not appear to differ on the basis of target population. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides modest evidence supporting the effectiveness of smartphone apps to increase physical activity. To date, apps have been most effective in the short term (eg, up to 3 months). Future research is needed to understand the time course of intervention effects and to investigate strategies to sustain intervention effects over time.

AB  - Objectives: Mindfulness training for smoking cessation may work by lessening the association between craving and smoking. However, no studies have tested whether baseline craving may be an indicator of individual smokers who might benefit more from receiving mindfulness training. Methods: This study evaluated baseline craving strength and frequency as treatment moderators in a randomized controlled trial for smoking cessation comparing mobile (smartphone-based) mindfulness training plus ecological momentary assessment (MMT-EMA) to ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Participants included 325 adult smokers (71.7% female; 81.4% White; mean age = 41.27). Craving strength and frequency were assessed with the Craving Experiences Questionnaire. Smoking was measured as cigarettes per day (CPD) at baseline and six-month follow-up. Moderated regression models were conducted. Results: There was a significant interaction between treatment group and craving strength, but not craving frequency, in the prediction of smoking. Follow-up analyses indicated that baseline craving strength predicted benefit from receiving MMT-EMA, such that higher craving strength at baseline was significantly associated with greater reductions in CPD from baseline to six months in the MMT-EMA group, but not in the EMA group. Conclusions: Findings suggest that baseline craving strength may be a prognostic marker of benefit from smartphone app-delivered mindfulness training for smoking cessation. Future work is warranted for understanding baseline craving as a moderator of mindfulness training for smoking cessation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Health apps are widely used and accepted by consumers. However, the clinical benefit of many commercially available health apps is unknown. The current project evaluated a commercially available mindfulness training app, HeadspaceRTM, with regard to quality of life (QOL), among women with breast cancer. App-based mindfulness training (AMT) intervention uptake, with respect to participants' health literacy, eHealth literacy, and perception of the app's usability, were also evaluated. Using a randomized controlled trial study design, QOL was evaluated among ( N = 95) women with a recent (< 5 years) breast cancer diagnosis. Participants were randomly assigned to 1) AMT or 2) waitlist control (WC). Participants assigned to AMT piloted the HeadspaceRTM app for 8-weeks and participants assigned to WC received the app at completion of 4-week follow-up. Participants completed web-based assessments at 4 observation points: baseline, week 5, week 9, and 4-week follow-up. Overall findings reveal higher QOL over time among participants assigned to AMT, compared to WC. Although the degree of change in mindfulness did not appear to be statistically significant, a post hoc analysis using a subset of the sample revealed detectable improvement in mindfulness among AMT compared to WC. Overall, participants' eHealth literacy, and perceived app usability were not associated with app utilization. Further, app usability did not appear to be associated with mindfulness at 4-week follow-up. Delivering mindfulness training using an app-based approach may be feasible for women with breast cancer. However, these findings may not extend to other mindfulness training apps. Additional research is needed to evaluate AMT in other settings, with a larger sample. Findings from this exploratory study may have implications for the delivery of future app-based interventions targeted toward this clinical population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of commercially available mobile app‐delivered mindfulness training (AMT), compared with waitlist control (WC), on quality of life (QOL) among women diagnosed with breast cancer. The secondary outcome was dispositional mindfulness. Enrollment, app utilization, and study completion are reported as feasibility objectives. METHODS: Women diagnosed with breast cancer ≤5 years (n = 112) were randomized to AMT (n = 57) or WC (n = 55), over 8 weeks, with 4 weeks of follow‐up. We conducted linear mixed effects models to examine group by observation interactions on QOL and dispositional mindfulness at baseline, during intervention (5‐weeks), post‐intervention (9‐weeks), and follow‐up (12‐weeks post‐baseline). RESULTS: Participants assigned to AMT reported higher QOL, compared with those assigned to WC, from baseline through follow‐up t(258.40) = 3.09, P < 0.01, 95% CI [2.71, 11.90]. Participants assigned to AMT also reported higher dispositional mindfulness, compared with those assigned to WC, from baseline through follow‐up t(268.44) = 2.04, P = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.57]. App utilization data was obtained from 34 participants. Fewer participants assigned to AMT completed all study assessments, compared with participants assigned to WC, (χ21 = 7.07, P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest commercially available AMT may proffer some benefit to women seeking to enhance their QOL following breast cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Background: Mindfulness training may improve quality of life (QoL) among women diagnosed with breast cancer, yet barriers associated with instructor-facilitated training (eg, cost, location, time) may limit uptake. Self-directed mindfulness training using smartphone apps may overcome these barriers. However, little is known about who may be most likely to engage in app-based mindfulness training (AMT) interventions. Objective: We examined baseline predictors of app engagement among women diagnosed with breast cancer (≤5 years) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a commercially available AMT intervention (Headspace). Methods: Participants (n=57) received AMT as part of a 12-week RCT. Headspace was available for download from iTunes or Google Play. Participants were asked to complete app registration using a unique activation code and complete ≥ 1 mindfulness session; this was defined as “minimum dose.” Overall, AMT engagement was self-guided. Participants completed baseline measures of QoL (FACT-B), dispositional mindfulness (MAAS), pain severity and interference (BPI-sf), and demographics. Log data was obtained from the app developers at the end of the study. AMT engagement was characterized by: attaining minimum dose, number of mindfulness sessions completed, and duration (minutes) of overall mindfulness practice. Results: Overall, 34 participants completed app registration and ≥1 mindfulness session (minimum dose). Over the 12-week trial, the median number of mindfulness sessions completed was 11.50 with a range of 1-87 sessions completed. Median duration of overall mindfulness practice was 115 minutes, with a range of 10-1411 minutes. Participants who attained minimum dose had greater baseline physical well-being (mean 20.74 [SD 5.67]) compared to those who did not have any recorded engagement with AMT (mean 16.43 [SD 8.15]; t[36.2]=-2.20, P=.04). Pain severity was lower for participants who attained minimum dose (mean 3.12 (SD 1.69]) compared to those who did not (mean 4.61 [SD 2.05]; t[29]=2.20, P=.04). Other domains of QoL, dispositional mindfulness, pain-related interference, and demographics did not differ between groups. Among those who attained minimum dose, only pain-related interference was associated with fewer mindfulness sessions completed (P=.05). Conclusions: App engagement was not recorded for slightly fewer than half of participants (ie, did not complete registration and ≥1 mindfulness session). Although reasons for non-adherence are unclear, findings suggest physical well-being and pain-related factors may be associated with participant AMT engagement. Given mindfulness practice time is associated with mindfulness skills uptake, future studies should explore approaches to optimize AMT engagement among participants with greater physical well-being and pain-related concerns.

AB  - Mobile health interventions may help transplant recipients follow their complex medical regimens. Pocket Personal Assistant for Tracking Health (Pocket PATH) is one such intervention tailored for lung transplant recipients. A randomized controlled trial showed Pocket PATH's superiority to usual care for promoting the self‐management behaviors of adherence, self‐monitoring and communication with clinicians during posttransplant year 1. Its long‐term impact was unknown. In this study, we examined associations between Pocket PATH exposure during year 1 and longer term clinical outcomes‐mortality and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS)‐among 182 recipients who survived the original trial. Cox regression assessed whether (a) original group assignment and (b) performance of self‐management behaviors during year 1 predicted time to outcomes. Median follow‐up was 5.7 years after transplant (range 4.2‐7.2 years). Pocket PATH exposure had no direct effect on outcomes (p‐values >0.05). Self‐monitoring was associated with reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22‐0.91; p = 0.027), and reporting abnormal health indicators to clinicians was associated with reduced risks of mortality (HR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04‐0.65; p = 0.011) and BOS (HR 0.27; 95% CI 0.08‐0.86; p = 0.026), regardless of intervention group assignment. Although Pocket PATH did not have a direct impact on long‐term outcomes, early improvements in self‐management facilitated by Pocket PATH may be associated with long‐term clinical benefit.

AB  - Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are common in military service members (SMs), but stigma can impede treatment initiation. Smartphone applications (apps) are available anywhere, anytime, with the potential to both mitigate the impact of stigma and reduce PTSD symptom severity. We provided 144 SMs or family members, with subthreshold PTSD symptoms (PTSD Checklist [PCL] scores of 28-49), with apps promoting psychoeducation, social engagement, and relaxation and randomized them to 6 weeks of resilience enhancement (brief cognitive-behavioral session, followed by daily text messages directing app use) or a control group (daily text messages of inspirational quotes). Participants (54 percent males, 87 percent SMs) in both groups reported reductions in PTSD, anxiety, and depression symptoms during the 6-week intervention, which were sustained at 3 months, but exhibited partial rebound at 6-12 months. Our preliminary results suggest that app use, with or without specific direction, feasibly and effectively reduces symptom severity. Future studies should consider a longer intervention, enhanced compliance tracking, or boosters to sustain benefits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often yield suboptimal outcomes, partly because of insufficient targeting of underlying psychological mechanisms (eg, avoidance reinforcement learning). Mindfulness training (MT) has shown efficacy for anxiety; yet, widespread adoption has been limited, partly because of the difficulty in scaling in-person-based delivery. Digital therapeutics are emerging as potentially viable treatments; however, very few have been empirically validated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the efficacy and mechanism of an app-delivered MT that was designed to target a potential mechanism of anxiety (reinforcement learning), based on which previous studies have shown concern regarding feedback and the perpetuation of anxiety through negative reinforcement. METHODS: Individuals with GAD were recruited using social media advertisements and randomized during an in-person visit to receive treatment as usual (n=33) or treatment as usual+app-delivered MT (Unwinding Anxiety; n=32). The latter was composed of 30 modules to be completed over a 2-month period. Associated changes in outcomes were assessed using self-report questionnaires 1 and 2 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS: We randomized 65 participants in this study, and a modified intent-to-treat approach was used for analysis. The median number of modules completed by the MT group was 25.5 (IQR 17) out of 30; 46% (13/28) of the participants completed the program. In addition, the MT group demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety (GAD-7) compared with the control group at 2 months (67% vs 14%; median change in GAD-7: -8.5 [IQR 6.5] vs -1.0 [IQR 5.0]; P<.001; 95% CI 6-10). Increases in mindfulness at 1 month (nonreactivity subscale) mediated decreases in worry at 2 months (Penn State Worry Questionnaire; P=.02) and decreases in worry at 1 month mediated reductions in anxiety at 2 months (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficacy and mechanism of an app-delivered MT for GAD. These findings demonstrate the clinical efficacy of MT as a digital therapeutic for individuals with anxiety (number needed to treat=1.6). These results also link recent advances in our mechanistic understanding of anxiety with treatment development, showing that app-delivered MT targets key reinforcement learning pathways, resulting in tangible, clinically meaningful reductions in worry and anxiety. Evidence-based, mechanistically targeted digital therapeutics have the potential to improve health at a population level at a low cost.

AB  - Abstract : Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Despite the availability of efficacious pharmacological and behavioral treatments, 85% of quit attempts end in failure. Mindfulness meditation training may be useful in smoking cessation. This study was a parallel group randomized controlled trial of a brief mindfulness meditation (Brief-MM) intervention delivered to smokers on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) in the field. Adult community smokers (N = 44) were randomly assigned to a Brief-MM (n = 24) or Control (sham meditation training; n = 20) group. All participants carried a PDA for two weeks and were instructed to initiate 20 minutes of meditation (or control) training on the PDA once per day and to complete an assessment of cognitive and affective processes immediately afterwards. Additionally, they were prompted to complete assessments at random times up to four times per day. Smokers were instructed to smoke as much or as little as they liked during the study. Thirty-two participants (Brief-MM = 18; Control =14) completed the study; 37 participants provided at least one EMA data point and completed in total 1874 assessments. Brief-MM was determined to be feasible and acceptable with 82.87% (95% CI [71.19%, 94.55%]) adherence to home meditation practice. Linear mixed model (LMM) analyses revealed that Brief-MM increased state, but not trait, mindfulness over time. LMMs also indicated that Brief-MM reduced cigarettes smoked per day over time more than the Control group (Group xDay interaction, F [1, 436] = 6.02, PE = -0.30, SE = 0.12, p = .01); reduced craving post-meditation, Group x Assessment Type interaction (F [2, 1728] = 5.78, PE =0.80, SE = 0.26, p = .003); and reduced negative affect (F [1, 1728] = 15.7, PE = -2.93, SE = 0.74, p .001). Hypothesized changes to positive affect, a decentered perspective, and attentional bias were not supported.

AB  - A central component of many psychological interventions is breathing training. Breathing training protocols based on a mindfulness or a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) have demonstrated value in the management of psychological and medical ailments. Yet, despite the wealth of literature examining each approach, little direct comparison exists. An additional concern is the proliferation of smart phone health (mHealth) applications (apps) providing breathing training with little empirical evidence to support their clinical use. A possible explanation for the interest in breathing and mHealth apps is the growing body of literature indicating breathing training provides wide ranging health benefits through improved stasis of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). As ANS dysregulation underlies many chronic health conditions such as persistent temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), there is a need for empirical research to identify the most effective modality of breathing training and validate the clinical efficacy of breathing based mHealth apps. Study One compared the effectiveness of a mindfulness breathing meditation (MB) and a CBT based protocol teaching diaphragmatic breathing (DB) to improve biomarkers of ANS stasis. An attention control approach based on the Nolen-Hoeksema task (C) was included as a comparison group. Ninety participants were randomly assigned to either the MB, DB, or C condition. Within each condition, 30 participants were provided skills training with practice time and completed a behavioral self-regulation task. Participants in the DB condition approach had significantly lower breathing rates than those in the MB and C conditions (p < .001). DB condition participants experienced improvements on high-frequency heart rate variability (p < .05) and the standard deviation in NN intervals (p < .001), which served as indicators for ANS stasis. No differences were found between conditions on the behavioral self-regulation task (p's > .05). Given these results, the DB training protocol was converted into a mHealth app to facilitate a clinical trial with patients suffering persistent TMDs. Study Two examined the additive benefits of including the mHealth app with standard dental care (SDC+) versus standard dental care alone (SDC). Nineteen patients seeking care for persistent TMDs were recruited. All participants were asked to track daily ratings of pain (VAS), relaxation (RR), and complete weekly assessments on several comorbid psycho-social factors. Within the SDC+ condition participants were asked to track the proximate effects of each breathing practice on VAS and RR ratings. Given a high drop-out rate (nine participants) and low overall sample size (N = 10), results are exploratory at best. Within the SDC+ condition, results indicated reliable improvements in average VAS and RR ratings from before and after SDC+ participants used the mHealth app (p's < .05). Within a one session training paradigm, results supported the use of a DB based intervention above the use of a MB or C intervention. Future research should consider the effects of having multiple training sessions. Study Two results were complicated by a limited sample size and failed to provide a clear picture of whether the conjunctive treatment in the SDC+ condition provided additional symptom relief above traditional dental care alone. Although exploratory results indicated the mHealth app provided temporary improvements in pain and feelings of relaxation, a well powered trial is needed to clarify whether the finding represents an enduring treatment effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Striving to be Strong (StbS) study tested the efficacy of a multifaceted, theory based, complex osteoporosis prevention smartphone application (app). We hypothesized use of the app would improve bone mineral density and trabecular bone scores. METHODS: The study was a three‐group, prospective, repeated measure, longitudinal randomized trial. Baseline sample consisted of 290 healthy women between 40 and 60 years of age. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: "Striving," a dynamically tailored, person‐centered app; "Boning Up," standardized osteoporosis‐education e‐book; and "Wait List," participant choice of intervention in the final three months of the 12 month study. Participants had or were provided a smart phone. Bone mineral density and trabecular bone scores were measured using dual energy X‐ray absorptiometry at baseline and 12 months. To assess engagement in health behavior change processes, ecological momentary assessments were administered via text messaging during the 12‐months participants actively used the app. RESULTS: The final sample reflects an 89.6% retention rate. There were decreases in bone mineral density over time but not among the three groups. The percent of bone density lost over 12 months was lower than expected. Trabecular bone scores were not different over time or by group, but improved across all three groups. DISCUSSION: Small but positive results were observed across all groups, suggesting one or more aspects of participation might have affected outcomes including dissemination of the intervention across groups, retention without participation, ecological momentary assessments functioning as both an intervention and measure, and selective engagement in research based recommendations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of Web‐based apps to promote a healthy lifestyle is increasing, although most of these programs were not assessed using suitable epidemiological methods. We evaluated the effectiveness of a newly developed Web‐based app in promoting a healthy lifestyle and educating adults on such lifestyles. We also analyzed predictors for success in acquiring and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to compare people receiving a new Web‐based app with people who got an introductory lecture alone on healthy lifestyle, weight change, nutritional knowledge, and physical activity, and to identify predictors of success for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. METHODS: Subjects were recruited from the community and were randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention subjects received access to the app without any face‐to‐face support; the control subjects continued their standard lifestyle. Measurements were taken by the researcher at baseline and after 14 weeks and included weight and waist circumference. Nutritional knowledge, diet quality, and physical activity duration were obtained using online questionnaires. The new Web‐based app was developed based on current US Department of Agriculture and Israel Ministry of Health recommendations for healthy lifestyle. The app provides tools for monitoring diet and physical activity while instructing and encouraging healthy diet and physical activity. RESULTS: Out of 99 subjects who were randomized into app and control groups, 85 participants (86%) completed the study, 56 in the intervention and 29 in the control group. The mean age was 47.9 (SD 12.3) years, and mean Body Mass Index was 26.2 (SD 3.9). Among the intervention group only, frequency of app use was 2.7 (SD 1.9) days/week. The mean change in physical activity was 63 (SD 20.8) minutes in the app group and ‐30 (SD 27.5) minutes in the control group (P=.02). The mean weight change was ‐1.44 (SD 0.4) kg in the app group and ‐0.128 (SD 0.36) kg in the control group (P=.03). Knowledge score increased significantly in the app group, 76 (SD 7.5) to 79 (SD 8.7) at the end of the study (P=.04) compared with the control group. Diet quality score also increased significantly at the end of the study, from 67 (SD 9.8) to 71 (SD 7.6; P<.001) in contrast to the control group. Success score (represents the success in maintaining healthy lifestyle) was higher among the app group (68%) compared with 36% in the control group (P<.001). The app frequency of use was significantly related to a higher success score (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We showed a positive impact of a newly developed Web‐based app on lifestyle indicators during an intervention of 14 weeks. These results are promising in the app's potential to promote a healthy lifestyle, although larger and longer duration studies are needed to achieve more definitive conclusions.

AB  - Importance: Lower back pain (LBP) is a prevalent and challenging condition in primary care. The effectiveness of an individually tailored self‐management support tool delivered via a smartphone app has not been rigorously tested. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of selfBACK, an evidence‐based, individually tailored self‐management support system delivered through an app as an adjunct to usual care for adults with LBP‐related disability. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial with an intention‐to‐treat data analysis enrolled eligible individuals who sought care for LBP in a primary care or an outpatient spine clinic in Denmark and Norway from March 8 to December 14, 2019. Participants were 18 years or older, had nonspecific LBP, scored 6 points or higher on the Roland‐Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), and had a smartphone and access to email. Interventions: The selfBACK app provided weekly recommendations for physical activity, strength and flexibility exercises, and daily educational messages. Self‐management recommendations were tailored to participant characteristics and symptoms. Usual care included advice or treatment offered to participants by their clinician. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was the mean difference in RMDQ scores between the intervention group and control group at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included average and worst LBP intensity levels in the preceding week as measured on the numerical rating scale, ability to cope as assessed with the Pain Self‐Efficacy Questionnaire, fear‐avoidance belief as assessed by the Fear‐Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, cognitive and emotional representations of illness as assessed by the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, health‐related quality of life as assessed by the EuroQol‐5 Dimension questionnaire, physical activity level as assessed by the Saltin‐Grimby Physical Activity Level Scale, and overall improvement as assessed by the Global Perceived Effect scale. Outcomes were measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months. Results: A total of 461 participants were included in the analysis; the population had a mean [SD] age of 47.5 [14.7] years and included 255 women (55%). Of these participants, 232 were randomized to the intervention group and 229 to the control group. By the 3‐month follow‐up, 399 participants (87%) had completed the trial. The adjusted mean difference in RMDQ score between the 2 groups at 3 months was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.06‐1.51; P =.03), favoring the selfBACK intervention. The percentage of participants who reported a score improvement of at least 4 points on the RMDQ was 52% in the intervention group vs 39% in the control group (adjusted odds ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.15‐2.70; P =.01). Conclusions and Relevance: Among adults who sought care for LBP in a primary care or an outpatient spine clinic, those who used the selfBACK system as an adjunct to usual care had reduced pain‐related disability at 3 months. The improvement in pain‐related disability was small and of uncertain clinical significance. Process evaluation may provide insights into refining the selfBACK app to increase its effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) during pregnancy is a major public health concern associated with negative health outcomes for both mother and child. Scalable interventions are needed, and digital interventions have the potential to reach many women and promote healthy GWG. Most previous studies of digital interventions have been small pilot studies or have not included women from all BMI categories. We therefore examined the effectiveness of a smartphone app in a large sample (n=305) covering all BMI categories. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a 6‐month intervention (the HealthyMoms app) on GWG, body fatness, dietary habits, moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA), glycemia, and insulin resistance in comparison to standard maternity care. METHODS: A 2‐arm parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted. Women in early pregnancy at maternity clinics in Östergötland, Sweden, were recruited. Eligible women who provided written informed consent completed baseline measures, before being randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either an intervention (n=152) or control group (n=153). The control group received standard maternity care while the intervention group received the HealthyMoms smartphone app for 6 months (which includes multiple features, eg, information; push notifications; self‐monitoring; and feedback features for GWG, diet, and physical activity) in addition to standard care. Outcome measures were assessed at Linköping University Hospital at baseline (mean 13.9 [SD 0.7] gestational weeks) and follow‐up (mean 36.4 [SD 0.4] gestational weeks). The primary outcome was GWG and secondary outcomes were body fatness (Bod Pod), dietary habits (Swedish Healthy Eating Index) using the web‐based 3‐day dietary record Riksmaten FLEX, MVPA using the ActiGraph wGT3x‐BT accelerometer, glycemia, and insulin resistance. RESULTS: Overall, we found no statistically significant effect on GWG (P=.62); however, the data indicate that the effect of the intervention differed by pre‐pregnancy BMI, as women with overweight and obesity before pregnancy gained less weight in the intervention group as compared with the control group in the imputed analyses (‐1.33 kg; 95% CI ‐2.92 to 0.26; P=.10) and completers‐only analyses (‐1.67 kg; 95% CI ‐3.26 to ‐0.09; P=.031]). Bayesian analyses showed that there was a 99% probability of any intervention effect on GWG among women with overweight and obesity, and an 81% probability that this effect was over 1 kg. The intervention group had higher scores for the Swedish Healthy Eating Index at follow‐up than the control group (0.27; 95% CI 0.05‐0.50; P=.017). We observed no statistically significant differences in body fatness, MVPA, glycemia, and insulin resistance between the intervention and control group at follow up (P≥.21). CONCLUSIONS: Although we found no overall effect on GWG, our results demonstrate the potential of a smartphone app (HealthyMoms) to promote healthy dietary behaviors as well as to decrease weight gain during pregnancy in women with overweight and obesity.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is tremendous need for efficacious and accessible interventions for smoking cessation among American Indians and Alaska Natives. We tested the efficacy of an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based smartphone application (iCanQuit) vs. US Clinical Practice Guidelines based smartphone application (QuitGuide) for smoking cessation among American Indians and Alaska Natives. METHODS: We compared cessation, changes in ACT-based processes, engagement and satisfaction between American Indians and Alaska Natives iCanQuit (n=89) and QuitGuide (n=80) trial participants enrolled in the iCanQuit trial. The primary outcome was self-reported, complete-case, 30-day point-prevalence abstinence (PPA). Follow-up timepoints were 12, 6, and 3-months. RESULTS: Randomized American Indians and Alaska Natives from 31 US states (70% urban, 30% rural, with 25% of participants residing on tribal land). The outcome data retention rates were 93%, 92%, and 90% at the 12, 6, and 3-month follow-ups, respectively, with no differential retention between arms. The 30-day PPA for iCanQuit vs. QuitGuide was 30% vs. 18% at 12-months (OR=1.96; 95% CI: 0.90, 4.26) 25% vs. 11% at 6-months (OR=2.62; 95% CI: 1.06, 6.45), and 15% vs. 6% at 3-months (OR=2.93; 95% CI: 0.90, 9.59). Increases in acceptance of internal cues to smoke mediated the effect of treatment on smoking cessation at 12-months. iCanQuit arm participants were also significantly more engaged and satisfied with their assigned application. CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide sample with high data retention and participant engagement, this is the first study to show that a digital intervention may be efficacious for helping American Indians and Alaska Natives quit smoking. IMPLICATONS: This is the first study to provide evidence of an efficacious, accessible, and engaging treatment for helping American Indians and Alaska Natives quit smoking. Compared to a USCPG-based smartphone application (QuitGuide), an ACT-based smartphone application (iCanQuit) was more efficacious, engaging, and satisfactory among American Indians and Alaska Natives nationwide. Our results will inform the tailoring of the iCanQuit smartphone application for American Indian and Alaska Native tribal communities and organizations with potential for broad dissemination and high impact.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the MEDication reminder APPs to improve medication adherence in Coronary Heart Disease Study was to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using publicly available high‐quality medication reminder applications (apps) to improve medication adherence compared with usual care in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). An additional aim was to examine whether an app with additional features improved adherence further. METHODS: Patients with CHD (n=163) were randomised to one of three groups: (1) usual care, (2) a basic app or (3) an advanced app with interactive/customisable features. The primary analysis compared usual care versus app use on the primary outcome of the 8‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS‐8) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure and cholesterol levels. RESULTS: The mean age was 57.9 years and 87.7% were male. At 3 months, patients using an app had higher adherence (mean MMAS‐8 score 7.11) compared with the usual care group (mean MMAS‐8 score 6.63) with a mean difference between groups of 0.47 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.82, p=0.008). There was no significant difference in patients using the basic app versus the advanced app (mean difference ‐0.16, 95% CI ‐0.56 to 0.24, p=0.428). There were no significant differences in secondary clinical outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Patients with CHD who used medication reminder apps had better medication adherence compared with usual care, and using apps with additional features did not improve this outcome further. These data suggest medication apps are likely to help patients with chronic health conditions adhere to medicines, but further examination of whether such benefits are sustained is warranted.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder is a chronic and debilitating psychiatric condition. Mobile‐based psychoeducation is a very impor‐tant tool for the treatment of this disorder. Objectives: The study aimed to provide scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of these tools for patients with bipolar dis‐order. Methods: In a randomized control trial (RCT) with a sample size of 41, the participants were randomly assigned to one of the intervention or the control arms based on the random number table. The study was performed in a psychiatric teaching hospital in Mashhad, Iran. The primary targets of the study was to measure the depression, manic, and anxiety symptoms that were measured at baseline and 3 months follow‐up for the intervention and the control group. A mobile application was developed and provided to the intervention group after discharge from the case hospital. The control group did not receive the application and received rou‐tine health care services during the study. A baseline comparison was performed between the groups, comparisons of the primary outcomes between the groups and within each group were carried out. Results: The results showed that the score of anxiety, depression, and mania at baseline and after the follow‐up did not have a significant decrease within the groups. In addition, a slight reduction in the depression and anxiety scores within the groups was found. The mean of anxiety (P‐value: 0.035), depression (P‐value: 0.024), and mania (P‐value: 0.007) after 3 month follow‐up had a significant decrease between the groups. A baseline comparison was performed between the groups, and comparisons of the primary outcomes between the groups and within each group were carried out. Conclusions: Given the low effectiveness of using mobile‐based psychoeducation on anxiety, depression, and mania in bipolar patients. It is recommended to use mobile applications as a complementary treatment along with other types of treatment for bipolar patients in future studies to obtain more evidence about the effectiveness of mobile‐based psychoeducation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postnatal depression and caregiving difficulties adversely affect mothers, infants, and later childhood development. In many countries, resources to help mothers and infants are limited. Online group‐based nurse‐led interventions have the potential to help address this problem by providing large numbers of mothers with access to professional and peer support during the postnatal period. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the effectiveness of a 4‐month online group‐based nurse‐led intervention delivered when infants were aged 2 to 6 months as compared with standard care outcomes. METHODS: The study was a block randomized control trial. Mothers were recruited at the time they were contacted for the postnatal health check offered to all mothers in South Australia. Those who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to the intervention or standard care. The overall response rate was 63.3% (133/210). Primary outcomes were the level of maternal depressive symptoms assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and quality of maternal caregiving assessed using the Parenting Stress Index (PSI; competence and attachment subscales), the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSCS), and the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Scale. Assessments were completed at baseline (mean child age 4.9 weeks [SD 1.4]) and again when infants were aged 8 and 12 months. RESULTS: Outcomes were evaluated using linear generalized estimating equations adjusting for postrandomization group differences in demographic characteristics and the outcome score at baseline. There were no significant differences in the intervention and standard care groups in scores on the PSI competence subscale (P=.69) nor in the PSCS (P=.11). Although the group by time interaction suggested there were differences over time between the EPDS and PSI attachment subscale scores in the intervention and standard care groups (P=.001 and P=.04, respectively), these arose largely because the intervention group had stable scores over time whereas the standard care group showed some improvements between baseline and 12 months. Mothers engaged well with the intervention with at least 60% (43/72) of mothers logging‐in once per week during the first 11 weeks of the intervention. The majority of mothers also rated the intervention as helpful and user‐friendly. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers reported that the intervention was helpful, and the app was described as easy to use. As such, it appears that support for mothers during the postnatal period, provided using mobile phone technology, has the potential to be an important addition to existing services. Possible explanations for the lack of differences in outcomes for the 2 groups in this study are the failure of many mothers to use key components of the intervention and residual differences between the intervention and standard care groups post randomization.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examine if the Gray Matters intervention (education and behavioral self‐monitoring app targeting lifestyle risks for Alzheimer's disease [AD]) affected participants' motivation for change and whether high motivation predicts improved diet and physical activity over 6 months. DESIGN: In this 6‐month randomized controlled trial (treatment n=104; control n=42; assessed pre/post intervention) amotivation, external regulation, identified regulation, and intrinsic motivation were assessed via the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS). Diet quality was assessed via adherence to the DASH diet, and physical activity was assessed in minutes. PARTICIPANTS: Eligibility criteria included not having significant cognitive impairment. Participants were aged 39‐64 (M = 54.17, SD = 6.9), 66% female, 81% married, 90% White, and 80% had a college degree. INTERVENTION: Treatment included an activity tracker, Gray Matters app, access to booster sessions, contact with a student health coach, and study website. SETTING: Participants were in the general community. RESULTS: Independent samples t‐tests determined that intrinsic motivation (IM) increased significantly for the treatment group (M = 2.09 SD = 4.82), compared to the control group (M = 1.00 SD = 5.52; t (130) = ‐3.04, p = .003). Comparing subgroups of people with High vs Low IM we found that High IM males increased vigorous physical activity more than Lower IM males (F(1,42)=5.053, p=.030). Comparing persons aged 58‐64 years with High vs Lower IM, High IM persons had less improvement in diet quality F(1,48)=4.538; p=0.038). CONCLUSION: RCT results support that the Gray Matters AD‐focused intervention increased IM, and IM was associated with improved physical activity and diet quality for some subgroups.

AB  - Objective: Strong cravings to smoke are an obstacle to cessation success. Unfortunately, cessation medication and counseling only modestly quell craving. This pilot study was designed to examine the feasibility of mobile games as a response strategy to craving and whether a fully powered trial is warranted. Materials and Methods: Smokers interested in quitting (Nâ€‰=â€‰30) were offered 4 weeks of nicotine patch plus counseling and randomized to quit with (games‐on) versus without (games‐off) access to 11 commercial mobile games. Outcomes included post‐target quit day (TQD) game play, craving, smoking, and quitting. Almost all P's were >0.05; outcomes should be interpreted with caution due to the small N. Results: Of games‐on participants (nâ€‰=â€‰16), one played games â‰¥80% of days post‐TQD (22/28 days); 38% played >1/3 of days; 25% did not play. Games‐on participants reported games moderately helped them cope with cravings; Mâ€‰=â€‰3.22 on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Also, games‐on participants showed a slight decrease in craving from baseline to 1‐week post‐TQD (2.35‐2.25 on a 0‐5 point‐scale), whereas games‐off participants showed an increase (2.01‐2.53). Games‐on participants showed greater decreases in craving after playing a game than after the passage of time (when an app imposed a 2‐minute wait period following their game request), but there was little evidence games‐on versus games‐off participants differed in mean post‐TQD cigarettes/day. Games‐on participants reported modestly but not significantly higher continuous abstinence through day 28 (31.3% vs. 21.4%). Conclusion: Feasibility results encourage a fully powered trial of this easily disseminable intervention. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02164383.

AB  - The onset of schizophrenia occurs during a period critical for development of social relationships and functional independence. As such, interventions that target the early course of illness have the potential to stave off functional decline and restore functioning to pre‐illness levels. In this entirely remote study, people with recent‐onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) participated in a 12‐week randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of PRIME (personalized real‐time intervention for motivational enhancement), a mobile‐based digital health intervention designed to improve motivation and quality of life. Participants were randomized into the PRIME (n = 22) or treatment‐as‐usual/waitlist (TAU/WL) condition (n = 21) and completed assessments at baseline, post‐trial (12 wk), and for people in the PRIME condition, 3 months after the end of the trial. After 12‐weeks, WL participants received PRIME, resulting in a total sample of 38 participants completing PRIME. In PRIME, participants worked towards self‐identified goals with the support of a virtual community of age‐matched peers with schizophrenia‐spectrum disorders as well as motivation coaches. Compared to the WL condition, people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in self‐reported depression, defeatist beliefs, self‐efficacy, and a trend towards motivation/pleasure negative symptoms post‐trial, and these improvements were maintained 3 months after the end of trial. We also found that people in the PRIME condition had significantly greater improvements in components of social motivation post‐trial (anticipated pleasure and effort expenditure). Our results suggest that PRIME has the potential to be an effective mobile‐based intervention for improving aspects of mood and motivation in young people with SSDs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a multifaceted syndrome that requires self‐management for adherence to treatment to control symptoms. Symptoms need to be monitored to prevent impending HF exacerbations. Few HF study authors have assessed efficacy of mobile health (mHealth) interventions particularly with virtual visits to evaluate outcomes such as symptoms and healthcare utilization. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential effect of mHealth self‐management interventions on symptom status and health‐related quality of life and describe health care utilization in patients with HF. METHODS: This 3‐month pilot study included 74 patients with HF and used a randomized 3‐group repeated‐measures design (enhanced usual care, mHealth, and mHealth plus [+] virtual visits). Surveys included the Heart Failure Symptom Survey, EuroQol, and a specialized phone application for patients to report weights and medications. RESULTS: The mHealth groups had an overall decrease in most symptom severity and frequency, particularly shortness of breath. Compared to enhanced usual care, both the mHealth+ and mHealth groups showed promise with medium effect sizes (range .55‐.60) in relation to shortness of breath and a medium effect (.51) for lower extremity edema for the mHealth+ group. There was a trend toward improvement in health‐related quality of life in both intervention groups at month 3. The mHealth+ group had fewer rehospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: In general, both mHealth groups fared better on symptoms and health care utilization. Small to medium effect sizes on selected symptom outcomes warrant this study to be conducted in a fully powered study. Virtual visits may assist in symptom recognition and self‐management.

AB  - Background: Body dissatisfaction is a symptom of a variety of mental disorders. Implicit processes, such as attention biases, contribute to the maintenance of body dissatisfaction. These are expressed among others in a focus on socially threatening stimuli. Such implicit processes could be positively influenced by attention-based cognitive bias modification (CBM-A) to improve body satisfaction. Aim of the study: The present pilot study aimed at evaluating whether a 1-week CBM-A intervention via a smartphone app can improve the body and appearance satisfaction in young women. Material and methods: In a randomized controlled trial 40 female participants (average age 24.5 years) were either allocated to an intervention group (IG) using a CBM-A app with socially threatening facial stimuli or to a waiting group (CG). Before and after the 1-week intervention period the body and appearance satisfaction as well as self-esteem and well-being of the participants were collated and evaluated by variance analysis. Results: In the IG the body and appearance satisfaction improved significantly over the period of the CBM-A intervention (ps< 0.019), whereas no comparable effect was observed in the CG. There were no significant effects on self-esteem and well-being in either group. Overall, the mobile CBM-A-intervention was well accepted. Conclusion: The preliminary results indicate a potential for the application of smartphone-based CBM-A interventions to improve body satisfaction in young women as a supplement, for example to psychotherapy; however, mediating processes and a possible application in clinical samples should be evaluated in future studies with larger numbers of participants. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (German) Hintergrund: Korperunzufriedenheit ist ein Symptom verschiedener psychischer Storungen. Implizite Prozesse, wie Aufmerksamkeitsverzerrungen, spielen eine Rolle bei der Aufrechterhaltung der Korperunzufriedenheit. Diese ausern sich u. a. in einer Fokussierung auf sozial bedrohliche Reize. Solche impliziten Prozesse konnten durch eine implizite aufmerksamkeitsbasierte cognitive-bias-modification" (CBM-A) positiv beeinflusst werden, um Korperunzufriedenheit zu reduzieren. Ziel der Arbeit: In dieser Pilotstudie wurde untersucht, ob eine mobile, einwochige CBM-A-Intervention in einer Smartphone-App die Korper- und Aussehenszufriedenheit von jungen Frauen erhohen kann. Material und Methoden: In einer randomisierten kontrollierten Studie wurden 40 Probandinnen (Alter: M = 24,5 Jahre) der CBM-A-Intervention mit sozial bedrohlichen Gesichterstimuli (IG) oder einer Wartegruppe (KG) zugeteilt. Vor und nach einer einwochigen Interventionsphase (10 min/Tag) der IG wurden die Korper- und Aussehenszufriedenheit sowie der Selbstwert und das Wohlbefinden erfasst und varianzanalytisch ausgewertet. Ergebnisse: In der IG verbesserten sich die Korper- und Aussehenszufriedenheit uber den Zeitraum der CBM-A-Intervention signifikant (ps < 0,019), wahrend die KG keine Veranderungen aufwies. Selbstwert und Wohlbefinden zeigten keine signifikanten Veranderungen. Die CBM-A-Intervention wurde insgesamt gut akzeptiert. Schlussfolgerung: Die ersten Ergebnisse zeigen ein Potenzial fur den Einsatz Smartphone-basierter CBM-A-Interventionen zur Verbesserung der Korperzufriedenheit bei jungen Frauen als Erganzung beispielsweise zu psychotherapeutischen Interventionen. Jedoch sind vermittelnde Prozesse und die Einsatzmoglichkeiten in klinischen Stichproben in zukunftigen, groseren Studien zu uberprufen. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Persons living with HIV (PLWH) are living longer but experiencing more adverse symptoms associated with the disease and its treatment. This study aimed to examine the impact of a mHealth application (app) comprised of evidence‐based self‐care strategies on the symptom experience of PLWH. We conducted a 12‐week feasibility study with 80 PLWH who were randomized (1:1) to a mHealth app, mobile Video Information Provider (mVIP), with self‐care strategies for improving 13 commonly experienced symptoms in PLWH or to a control app. Intervention group participants showed a significantly greater improvement than the control group in 5 symptoms: anxiety (p = 0.001), depression (p = 0.001), neuropathy (p = 0.002), fever/chills/sweat (p = 0.037), and weight loss/wasting (p = 0.020). Participants in the intervention group showed greater improvement in adherence to their antiretroviral medications (p = 0.017) as compared to those in the control group. In this 12‐week trial, mVIP was associated with improved symptom burden and increased medication adherence in PLWH.

AB  - Our study team developed the MyPEEPS Mobile App for improving HIV prevention behaviors in diverse young men. We conducted a randomized controlled trial and evaluated the preliminary outcomes in the first half (N=350) of our intended study sample. Higher self‐efficacy for HIV prevention behaviors (p=0.0042) and more recent HIV tests in the past 3 months (p=0.0156) were reported by the intervention group compared to control. Numbers of condomless anal sex acts were lower among the intervention group for both insertive anal sex acts (p=0.0283) and receptive anal sex acts (p=0.0001). Preliminary results indicate that some sexual risk behaviors were reduced among the intervention group in the preliminary analytic sample.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the VIP‐HANA application (app) for improving symptom burden in a randomized control trial of 100 people living with HIV (PLWH) who have non‐AIDS conditions associated with HIV. The intervention group received the VIP‐HANA app which allowed them to report their symptoms every week and receive self‐management strategies tailored to their symptoms. The control arm received an app to report their symptoms every week but did not receive any strategies. The results of our study suggest that symptom burden improved in the participants of both study arms. Although these findings do not support the efficacy of VIP‐HANA in improving symptom burden in PLWH who have HIV‐associated non‐AIDS (HANA) conditions, this could be a function of the study design. Findings suggest that PLWH are interested in monitoring their symptoms, which could have implications for the wider use of digital health for patient surveillance.

AB  - The worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the resulting lockdown has affected the whole world and the maintenance of healthy eating behavior might be an additional challenge. Self-compassion (SC) interventions emphasize not only treating oneself in a caring way regarding personal weaknesses, e.g., diet lapses, but also the recognition of shared human suffering. Thus, self-compassion might be particularly valuable during the current worldwide crisis due to COVID-19. In this study, N = 65 participants that wanted to lose weight or develop a healthier eating behavior were randomized to either a 14-day self-compassion intervention arm or a waitlist control arm. The intervention consisted of daily journaling exercises and meditations via smartphone with a focus on improving eating behavior. Before and after the intervention phase, questionnaires on self-compassion, eating, dieting, health behavior, stress, and emotion regulation were completed and body weight was determined. Participants in the treatment arm (n = 28) showed an increase in self-compassion, a decrease in perceived stress, eating in response to feeling anxious, and, on trend level, body mass index (BMI). Changes in self-compassion fully mediated changes in stress. No such effects were found in the waitlist control group (n = 29). Thus, self-compassion might help to maintain well-being and healthy eating habits in times of increased stress and isolation. Future studies should replicate these findings outside of the COVID-19 crisis and test the effect of self-compassion in samples with eating disorders or weight problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has underscored the need to develop socioculturally tailored interventions to improve adherence behaviors in minority patients with hypertension (HTN) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Novel mobile health (mHealth) approaches are potential methods for delivering tailored interventions to minority patients with increased cardiovascular risk. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a tailored mHealth adherence intervention versus attention control (AC) on medication adherence, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 3 months in 42 Black patients with uncontrolled HTN and/or T2D who were initially nonadherent to their medications. METHODS: This was a two‐phase pilot study consisting of a formative phase and a clinical efficacy phase. The formative phase consisted of qualitative interviews with 10 members of the target patient population (7/10, 70% female; mean age 65.8 years, SD 5.6) to tailor the intervention based on the Information‐Motivation‐Behavioral skills model of adherence. The clinical efficacy phase consisted of a 3‐month pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the tailored mHealth intervention versus an AC. The tablet‐delivered intervention included a tailoring survey, an individualized adherence profile, and a personalized list of interactive adherence‐promoting modules, whereas AC included the tailoring survey and health education videos delivered on the tablet. Acceptability was assessed through semistructured exit interviews. Medication adherence was assessed using the 8‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, whereas blood pressure and HbA1c were assessed using automated devices. RESULTS: In phase 1, thematic analysis of the semistructured interviews revealed the following 5 major barriers to adherence: disruptions in daily routine, forgetfulness, concerns about adverse effects, preference for natural remedies, and burdens of medication taking. Patients recommended the inclusion of modules that address improving patient‐provider communication, peer vignettes, and stress reduction strategies to facilitate adherence. A total of 42 Black patients (23/42, 55% male; mean age 57.6 years, SD 11.1) participated in the clinical efficacy pilot trial. At 3 months, both groups showed significant improvements in adherence (mean 1.35, SD 1.60; P<.001) and SBP (‐4.76 mm Hg; P=.04) with no between‐group differences (P=.50 and P=.10). The decreases in DBP and HbA1c over time were nonsignificant (‐1.97 mm Hg; P=.20; and ‐0.2%; P=.45, respectively). Patients reported high acceptability of the intervention for improving their adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrated preliminary evidence on the acceptability of a tailored mHealth adherence intervention among a sample of Black patients with uncontrolled HTN and T2D who were initially nonadherent to their medications. Future research should explore whether repeated opportunities to use the mHealth intervention would result in improvements in behavioral and clinical outcomes over time. Modifications to the intervention as a result of the pilot study should guide future efforts. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01643473; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT01643473.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health and fitness applications (apps) have gained popularity in interventions to improve diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviours but their efficacy is unclear. This systematic review examined the efficacy of interventions that use apps to improve diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children and adults. METHODS: Systematic literature searches were conducted in five databases to identify papers published between 2006 and 2016. Studies were included if they used a smartphone app in an intervention to improve diet, physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour for prevention. Interventions could be stand-alone interventions using an app only, or multi-component interventions including an app as one of several intervention components. Outcomes measured were changes in the health behaviours and related health outcomes (i.e., fitness, body weight, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, quality of life). Study inclusion and methodological quality were independently assessed by two reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included, most were randomised controlled trials (n = 19; 70%). Twenty-three studies targeted adults (17 showed significant health improvements) and four studies targeted children (two demonstrated significant health improvements). Twenty-one studies targeted physical activity (14 showed significant health improvements), 13 studies targeted diet (seven showed significant health improvements) and five studies targeted sedentary behaviour (two showed significant health improvements). More studies (n = 12; 63%) of those reporting significant effects detected between-group improvements in the health behaviour or related health outcomes, whilst fewer studies (n = 8; 42%) reported significant within-group improvements. A larger proportion of multi-component interventions (8 out of 13; 62%) showed significant between-group improvements compared to stand-alone app interventions (5 out of 14; 36%). Eleven studies reported app usage statistics, and three of them demonstrated that higher app usage was associated with improved health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This review provided modest evidence that app-based interventions to improve diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviours can be effective. Multi-component interventions appear to be more effective than stand-alone app interventions, however, this remains to be confirmed in controlled trials. Future research is needed on the optimal number and combination of app features, behaviour change techniques, and level of participant contact needed to maximise user engagement and intervention efficacy.

AB  - Smoking is a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality. Almost no evidence‐based intervention programs are available to help youth quit smoking. We argue that ineffective targeting of peer influence and engagement difficulties are significant barriers to successful youth smoking cessation. To address these barriers, we developed the mobile game intervention HitnRun. A two‐armed randomized controlled trial (RCT; n = 144) was conducted and young smokers (Mage = 19.39; SDage = 2.52) were randomly assigned to either play HitnRun or read a psychoeducational brochure. Prior to, directly following the intervention period, and after three‐month follow‐up, weekly smoking behavior, abstinence rates, intervention dose, and peer‐ and engagement‐related factors were assessed. Results indicated similar reductions in weekly smoking levels and similar abstinence rates for both groups. Yet, we found a dose effect with HitnRun only: The longer participants played HitnRun, the lower their weekly smoking levels were. In the brochure group, a higher dose was related to higher weekly smoking levels at all measurement moments. Exploratory analyses showed the most powerful effects of HitnRun for participants who connected with and were engaged by the intervention. Future work should build on the promising potential of HitnRun by increasing personalization efforts and strengthening peer influence components.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is one of the biggest public health threats. Smartphone apps offer new promising opportunities for supporting smoking cessation in real time. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effectiveness of an app that encourages individuals to quit smoking with the help of a social network member (buddy) in daily life. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of the SmokeFree buddy app compared with a control group with self‐reported smoking abstinence and carbon monoxide (CO)‐verified smoking abstinence as primary outcomes and self‐reports of smoked cigarettes per day (CPD) as a secondary outcome. METHODS: A total of 162 adults who smoked participated in this single‐blind, two‐arm, parallel‐group, intensive longitudinal randomized controlled trial. Around a self‐set quit date (ie, 7 days before the self‐set quit date and 20 days after) and 6 months later, participants of the intervention and control groups reported on daily smoking abstinence and CPD in end‐of‐day diaries. Daily smoking abstinence was verified via daily exhaled CO assessments. This assessment was administered via an app displaying results of exhaled CO, thus addressing self‐monitoring in both groups. In addition, participants in the intervention group used the SmokeFree buddy app, a multicomponent app that facilitates social support from a buddy of choice. RESULTS: A significant reduction in CPD from baseline to the 6‐month follow‐up was observed among participants in both groups. Multilevel analyses revealed no significant intervention effect on self‐reported and CO‐verified daily smoking abstinence at the quit date and 3 weeks later. However, CPD was lower at the quit date and 3 weeks later in the intervention group than in the control group. No significant differences between groups were found for any outcome measures 6 months after the quit date. Overall, low app engagement and low perceived usefulness were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some encouraging short‐term findings on the amount of smoking, the SmokeFree buddy app did not have beneficial effects on smoking abstinence over and above the self‐monitoring control condition. Future studies should examine whether and what support processes can be effectively stimulated and how app use can be improved to better achieve this goal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most smokers attempt to stop using cigarettes numerous times before successfully quitting. Cigarette cravings may undermine perceived competence to quit and thus constitute psychological threats to the individual's self‐concept. Self‐affirmation may promote smoking cessation by offsetting these threats. OBJECTIVE: This study examines whether self‐affirmation is associated with smoking cessation in the context of a cessation app. Two types of self‐affirmation are examined: tendency to spontaneously self‐affirm, and self‐affirmation inductions added to a publicly available smoking cessation app (Smoke‐Free Quit Smoking Now). In addition, this study explores whether optimism and emotional states (happiness, anger, anxiousness, hopefulness, sadness) predict smoking cessation. METHODS: All users who met the inclusion criteria, provided consent to participate, and completed a baseline assessment, including all individual difference measures, were randomized to 1 of 4 conditions. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to complete a self‐affirmation induction upon study entry. Orthogonally, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive self‐affirming text notifications during their quit attempt or to receive conventional notifications. The induction and the text notifications were fully automated, and all data were collected through self‐assessments in the app. Self‐reported smoking cessation was assessed 1 month and 3 months following study entry. RESULTS: The study enrolled 7899 participants; 647 completed the 1‐month follow‐up. Using an intent‐to‐treat analysis at the 1‐month follow‐up, 7.2% (569/7899) of participants self‐reported not smoking in the previous week and 6.4% (503/7899) self‐reported not smoking in the previous month. Greater tendency to spontaneously self‐affirm predicted a greater likelihood of cessation (P<.001) at 1 month after controlling for smoking‐related variables. Neither self‐affirmation induction influenced cessation. In addition, spontaneous self‐affirmation did not moderate the relationship between self‐affirmation inductions and cessation. Greater baseline sadness was associated with a lower likelihood of reporting successful cessation. Optimism predicted past‐week cessation at the 1‐month follow‐up, and both happiness and anger predicted past‐month cessation at the 1‐month follow‐up; however, none of these potential predictors moderated the relationship between self‐affirmation conditions and successful cessation. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous self‐affirmation may be an important psychological resource for managing threats to self‐concept during the smoking cessation process. Sadness may hinder quit attempts. Future research can explicate how spontaneous versus induced self‐affirmation can promote smoking cessation and examine boundary conditions for the effectiveness of disseminated self‐affirmation interventions.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and impact of using MyFitnessPal, a free, popular smartphone application ("app"), for weight loss. Study design: 2‐arm randomized controlled trial. Setting and participants: Participants were recruited from 2 primary care clinics in the University of California, Los Angeles heath system. The inclusion criteria for the study were ≥ 18 years of age, body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2, an interest in losing weight, and ownership of a smart‐phone. The exclusion criteria included pregnancy, hemodi‐alysis, life expectancy less than 6 months, lack of interest in weight loss, and current use of a smartphone app for weight loss. Out of 633 individuals assessed, 212 were eligible for the study. Participants were block randomized by BMI 25‐30 kg/m2 and BMI > 30 kg/m2 to either usual primary care (n = 107) or usual primary care plus the app (n = 10 5). Intervention: MyFitnessPal (MFP) was selected for this study based on previous focus groups with overweight primary care patients. MFP is a calorie‐counting app that incorporates evidence‐based and theory‐based approaches to weight loss. Users can enter their current weight, goal weight, and goal rate of weight loss, which allows the app to generate the user's daily, individualized calorie goal. MFP users also input daily weight, food intake, and physical activity, which produce certain outputs, including calorie counts, weight trends, and nutritional summaries based on food consumed. Participants in the intervention arm received help from research assistants in downloading MFP onto their smartphones and received a phone call 1 week after enrollment to assist with any technical issues with the app. Those in the control group were told to choose any preferred activity for weight loss. Both groups received usual care from their primary care provider, with an additional two follow‐up visits at 3 and 6 months. At the 3‐month follow‐up visit, all participants received a nutrition educational handout from www.myplate.gov. Main outcomes measures: The main outcome measure was weight change at 6 months. Blood pressure, weight, systolic blood pressure (SPB), and 3 self‐reported behavioral mediators of weight loss (exercise, diet, and self‐efficacy in weight loss) were measured and collected for all participants at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. This study also gathered data from the MyFitnessPal company to measure frequency of app usage. At the 6‐month follow‐up visit, research assistants asked participants in the intervention arm about their experience using MFP, while those in the control group were asked if they had used MFP in the past 6 months to assess contamination. The authors used a linear mixed effects model (PROC MIXED) in SAS data processing software to investigate the differences in weight change, SBP change, and change in behavioral survey items between the 2 groups while controlling for clinic site. In addition, they performed 2 sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of possible informative dropout (income, education, diet experience, treatment group, and baseline value), and the effect of excluding one control group outlier. Results: The majority of participants were female (73%) with a mean age of 43.4 years (SD = 14.3). The mean BMI was 33.4 kg/m2 (SD = 7.09), and 48% of the participants identified themselves as non‐Hispanic white. At the 3‐month visit, 26% and 21% of the participants from the intervention and control arms were lost to follow‐up. Additionally, at 6 months, 32% and 19% of intervention and control group participants were lost to follow‐up. There was no significant difference in weight change between the two groups at 3 months (control, + 0.54 lb; intervention, ‐0.06 lb; P = 0.53) or at 6 months (control, +0.6 lb; intervention, ‐0.07 lb; P = 0.63); between group difference at 3 months was ‐0.6 lb (95% confidence interval [CI], ‐2.5 to 1.3 lb; P = 0.53) and at 6 months was ‐0.67 lb (CI, ‐3.3 to 2.1 lb; P = 0.63). The sensitivity analysis based on possible missin data also suggested the same outcome with between group difference at 6 months at 0.08 lb (CI, ‐3.04 to 3.20 lb; P = 0.96). The difference in systolic blood pressure was not significant between the groups. Participants in the intervention arm used a personal calorie goal more often than those in the control group, with a mean between group difference at 3 months of 1.9 days per week (CI, 1.0 to 2.8; P < 0.001) and a mean between group difference at 6 months of 2.0 days per week (CI, 1.1 to 2.9; P < 0.001). The results also showed that the use of calorie goal feature was significant at 3 months (P < 0.001) and at 6 months (P < 0.001). At the 3‐month visit, the authors found that individuals in the intervention group reported decreased self‐efficacy in achieving their weight loss goals when compared to their counterparts (‐0.85 on a 10‐point scale; CI, ‐1.6 to ‐0.1; P = 0.026), but self‐efficacy was insignificant at the 6‐month follow‐up. Additionally, the results suggested no difference in self‐reported behaviors regarding diet, exercise, and self‐efficacy in weight loss between the groups. The mean number of logins was 61 during the course of the study, and the median total logins was 19. Interestingly, the data showed that there was a rapid decline of logins after enrollment for most participants in the intervention arm. There were 94 users who logged in to the app during the first month and 34 who logged in during the last month of the study. Out of 107 participants from the control group, 14 used MFP during the trial. Despite a sharp decline in usage, MFP users in the intervention group were satisfied with the app: 79% were somewhat to completely satisfied, 92% would recommend it to a friend, and 80% planned to continue using MFP after the study. The study indicated that there were several aspects that the users liked about MFP including ease of use (100%), feedback on progress (88%), and 48% indicated that it was fun to use. Fewer participants appreciated features such as the reminder feature (42%) and social networking feature (13%). A common theme the authors found in MFP users was increased awareness of food choices, and more caution about food choices. Of those that stopped using MFP, some comments regarding MFP included that it was tedious (84%) and not easy to use (24%). Conclusion: While most participants were satisfied with MFP, encouraging use of the app did not lead to more weight loss in primary care patients compared to usual care. There was decreased engagement with MFP over time.

AB  - Importance: Patients with residual depressive symptoms face a gap in care because few resources, to date, are available to manage the lingering effects of their illness. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness for treating residual depressive symptoms with Mindful Mood Balance (MMB), a web‐based application that delivers mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy, plus usual depression care compared with usual depression care only. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in primary care and behavioral health clinics at Kaiser Permanente Colorado, Denver. Adults identified with residual depressive symptoms were recruited between March 2, 2015, and November 30, 2018. Outcomes were assessed for a 15‐month period, comprising a 3‐month intervention interval and a 12‐month follow‐up period. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive usual depression care (UDC; n = 230) or MMB plus UDC (n = 230), which included 8 sessions delivered online for a 3‐month interval plus minimal phone or email coaching support. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were reduction in residual depressive symptom severity, assessed using the Patient Health Questionaire‐9 (PHQ‐9); rates of depressive relapse (PHQ‐9 scores â‰¥15); and rates of remission (PHQ‐9 scores <5). Secondary outcomes included depression‐free days, anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorder‐7 Item Scale), and functional status (12‐Item Short Form Survey). Results: Among 460 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 48.30 [14.89] years; 346 women [75.6%]), data were analyzed for the intent‐to‐treat sample, which included 362 participants (78.7%) at 3 months and 330 (71.7%) at 15 months. Participants who received MMB plus UDC had significantly greater reductions in residual depressive symptoms than did those receiving UDC only (mean [SE] PHQ‐9 score, 0.95 [0.39], P <.02). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved remission in the MMB plus UDC group compared with the UDC only group (PHQ‐9 score, <5: Î² [SE], 0.38 [0.14], P =.008), and rates of depressive relapse were significantly lower in the MMB plus UDC group compared with the UDC only group (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39‐0.95; P <.03). Compared with the UDC only group, the MMB plus UDC group had decreased depression‐free days (mean [SD], 281.14 [164.99] days vs 247.54 [158.32] days; difference,‐33.60 [154.14] days; t =‐2.33; P =.02), decreased anxiety (mean [SE] General Anxiety Disorder‐7 Item Scale score, 1.21 [0.42], P =.004), and improved mental functioning (mean [SE] 12‐Item Short Form Survey score,‐5.10 [1.37], P <.001), but there was no statistically significant difference in physical functioning. Conclusions and Relevance: Use of MMB plus UDC resulted in significant improvement in depression and functional outcomes compared with UDC only. The MMB web‐based treatment may offer a scalable approach for the management of residual depressive symptoms. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02190968.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies for the effectiveness of digital interventions designed to enhance adherence to physical activity (PA) for people with inflammatory arthritis and describe the intervention content using established coding criteria. Methods: Six electronic databases were searched for published and unpublished studies. Independent data extraction and quality assessment (Cochrane risk of bias II or ROBINS‐I) were conducted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was self‐reported adherence to PA post‐intervention. Secondary outcomes included self‐reported adherence to PA at other time points, level of PA or engagement with intervention at any follow‐up time point. Intervention content was assessed using the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template and the Behaviour Change Techniques Taxonomy version 1. Results: From 11 136 citations, four moderate risk of bias studies (three RCTs and one cohort study) including 1160 participants with RA or JIA were identified. Owing to heterogeneity of outcomes, a narrative synthesis was conducted. Only one RCT reported a small between‐group difference in adherence to PA [mean difference (95% CI)‐0.46 (‐0.82,‐0.09)] in favour of the intervention. There were no between‐group differences in any secondary outcomes. Interventions included between 3 and 11 behaviour change techniques but provided minimal information on exercise prescription. Conclusion: There is currently limited moderate‐quality evidence available to provide confident evaluation of the effect of web‐based and mobile health interventions on adherence to PA or level of PA post‐intervention in people with inflammatory arthritis.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to systematically review the evidence to explore whether smartphone applications that use self-regulatory strategies are beneficial for weight loss in overweight and obese adults over the age of 18 years. Sixteen electronic databases were searched for articles published up to April 2015 including MEDLINE, OVID, Ingenta, PSYCARTICLES and PSYCINFO, CINAHL, Sportdiscus, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, Cochrane Library, JSTOR, EBSCO, Proquest, Wiley and Google Scholar. Twenty nine eligible studies were retrieved of which six studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies that recruited participants under the age of 18 years, adults with a chronic condition or did not report weight loss outcomes were excluded. Study findings were combined using a narrative synthesis. Overall, evidence suggests that smartphone applications may be a useful tool for self-regulating diet for weight loss as participants in the smartphone application group in all studies lost at least some bodyweight. However, when compared to other self-monitoring methods, there was no significant difference in the amount of weight lost. Findings should be interpreted with caution based on the design of the studies and the comparator groups used. Future research needs to be more methodologically rigorous and incorporate measures of whether eating habits become healthier in addition to measuring weight and BMI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps represent a promising approach for improving health outcomes in patients with chronic illness, but surprisingly few mHealth interventions have investigated the association between user engagement and health outcomes. We aimed to examine the efficacy of a recommended, commercially available gout self‐management app for improving self‐care behaviors and to assess self‐reported user engagement of the app in a sample of adults with gout. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine differences in self‐reported user engagement between a recommended gout app (treatment group) and a dietary app (active control group) over 2 weeks as well as to examine any differences in self‐care behaviors and illness perceptions. METHODS: Seventy‐two adults with gout were recruited from the community and three primary and secondary clinics. Participants were randomized to use either Gout Central (n=36), a self‐management app, or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet Plan (n=36), an app based on a diet developed for hypertension, for 2 weeks. The user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (uMARS, scale: 1 to 5) was used after the 2 weeks to assess self‐reported user engagement, which included an open‐ended question. Participants also completed a self‐report questionnaire on self‐care behaviors (scale: 1‐5 for medication adherence and diet and 0‐7 for exercise) and illness perceptions (scale: 0‐10) at baseline and after the 2‐week trial. Independent samples t tests and analysis of covariance were used to examine differences between groups at baseline and postintervention. RESULTS: Participants rated the gout app as more engaging (mean difference ‐0.58, 95% CI ‐0.96 to ‐0.21) and more informative (mean difference ‐0.34, 95% CI ‐0.67 to ‐0.01) than the dietary app at the 2‐week follow‐up. The gout app group also reported a higher awareness of the importance of gout (mean difference ‐0.64, 95% CI ‐1.27 to ‐0.003) and higher knowledge/understanding of gout (mean difference ‐0.70, 95% CI ‐1.30 to ‐0.09) than the diet app group at follow‐up. There were no significant differences in self‐care behaviors between the two groups postintervention. The gout app group also demonstrated stronger negative beliefs regarding the impact of gout (mean difference ‐2.43, 95% CI ‐3.68 to ‐1.18), stronger beliefs regarding the severity of symptoms (mean difference ‐1.97, 95% CI ‐3.12 to ‐0.82), and a stronger emotional response to gout (mean difference ‐2.38, 95% CI ‐3.85 to ‐0.90) at follow‐up. Participant feedback highlighted the importance of tracking health‐related information, customizing to the target group/individual, providing more interactive features, and simplifying information. CONCLUSIONS: Participants found the commercially available gout app more engaging. However, these findings did not translate into differences in self‐care behaviors. The gout app group also demonstrated stronger negative illness perceptions at the follow‐up. Overall, these findings suggest that the development of gout apps would benefit from a user‐centered approach with a focus on daily, long‐term self‐care behaviors as well as modifying illness beliefs.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study's objective was to evaluate a patient-centered educational electronic tablet application, "My Interventional Drug-Eluting Stent Educational App" (MyIDEA) to see if there was an increase in patient knowledge about dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and medication possession ratio (MPR) compared to treatment as usual. METHODS: In a pilot project, 24 elderly (>=50 years old) research participants were recruited after a drug-eluting stent. Eleven were randomized to the control arm and 13 to the interventional arm. All the participants completed psychological and knowledge questionnaires. Adherence was assessed through MPR, which was calculated at 3 months for all participants who were scheduled for second and third follow-up visits. RESULTS: Relative to control, the interventional group had a 10% average increase in MPR. As compared to the interventional group, more patients in the control group had poor adherence (<80% MPR). The psychological data revealed a single imbalance in anxiety between the control and interventional groups. On average, interventional participants spent 21 min using MyIDEA. DISCUSSION: Consumer health informatics has enabled us to engage patients with their health data using novel methods. Consumer health technology needs to focus more on patient knowledge and engagement to improve long-term health. MyIDEA takes a unique approach in targeting DAPT from the onset. CONCLUSION: MyIDEA leverages patient-centered information with clinical care and the electronic health record highlighting the patients' role as a team member in their own health care. The patients think critically about adverse events and how to solve issues before leaving the hospital.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A significant barrier to improving the health and well‐being of older adults is that they often do not adhere to health‐promoting programs. The present study examined whether Bingocize®, a game‐centered mobile app that can combine bingo with healthy activities such as exercise and/or health topic education, could (1) engender high rates of adherence among sedentary community‐dwelling older adults, and (2) potentially improve aspects of physical and cognitive performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants used the app for ∼1 hour, twice per week, for 10 weeks. Each using a tablet, they played the game in small social groups and were randomly assigned to either an Experimental (Bingo + Health Education + Exercise) or Control (Bingo + Health Education) group. Pre‐ and Postintervention assessments of (1) functional performance, (2) fluid cognition, and (3) knowledge of two health topics (osteoarthritis and fall risks) were administered. RESULTS: Adherence was high in both groups (>93% attendance), suggesting the app was popular and engaging. Two (Experimental/Control) × Two (Pre/Post) interactions were found for two domains of functional performance (Arm Curls, a measure of upper body strength; and Chair Stands, a measure of lower body strength) and one domain of cognition (updating, a component of executive functioning), such that the Experimental group improved more relative to the Control group. Both groups improved their knowledge of the health topics covered (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the fun and interactive nature of Bingocize® engenders high levels of adherence to a health‐promoting program in a difficult to serve population, serving as a conduit to potentially improve multiple aspects of quality of life for older adults.

AB  - Addressing the stigma of mental illness and its effect in the workplace is a contemporary issue in occupational health. The role of leaders is a vital but relatively unexplored dimension of this phenomenon. This study examined the effectiveness and application of an online intervention to reduce depression‐related stigma in organizational leaders. A randomized controlled, "in the field" study was conducted with 196 leaders. Participants completed an online survey and were randomly assigned to either the experimental or wait‐list control group. One week later, participants in the experimental group were given access to a brief online workplace mental health intervention and asked to complete a postsurvey, whereas the control group had to only complete the online postsurvey. Six months later, participants completed a follow‐up online survey. Results revealed significant reductions in behavioral and affective depression‐related stigma scores among leaders who completed the intervention, compared with the control group. These reductions were similar at 6 months. The factors that enabled or hindered training transfer from the intervention were examined through semistructured interviews with 16 of the participating leaders. Results showed that positive attitudes and high levels of knowledge are not sufficient to ensure leaders apply intervention learning in their work environments. Factors including the nature of the work environment, the collective readiness and capability of the organization to address these issues, the attitudes of others at work, and the broader political context affected the application of learning from the intervention.

AB  - Objectives:Adherence with diet and prescribed purgative is essential for proper cleansing with low‐volume bowel preparations. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of a customized mobile application (App) on adherence and quality of bowel preparation.Methods:One hundred and sixty (160) eligible patients scheduled for elective colonoscopy were randomly assigned to paper (control) or App‐based instructions. The preparation consisted of low‐fiber diet for 2 days, clear fluids for one day and split‐dose sodium picosulfate/magnesium citrate (SPS). Before colonoscopy, information was collected regarding adherence with, and utility of the provided instructions. The colonoscopists, blinded to assignment, graded bowel preparation using the Aronchick, Ottawa, and Chicago preparation scales. The primary endpoint was adherence with instructions. Quality of preparation was a secondary endpoint.Results:No difference in overall adherence or bowel cleanliness was observed between the study arms. Adherence was reported in 82.4% of App vs. 73.4% of controls (P=0.40). An adequate bowel preparation on the Aronchick scale was noted in 77.2 vs. 82.5%, respectively (P=0.68). Mean scores on the Ottawa and Chicago scales were also similar. Gender, age, time of colonoscopy, and BMI did not influence preparation or adherence. Compliance with the clear fluid diet component was noted in 94% of patients with BMI<30 vs. 77% with BMI>30 (P<0.01). SPS was well tolerated by 81.9% of patients. The App was user‐friendly and received higher overall rating in this respect than paper instructions (P<0.01).Conclusions:SPS is well tolerated and effective for bowel cleansing regardless of instruction method. Customized smartphone applications are effective, well‐accepted and could replace standard paper instructions for bowel preparation.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02410720.

AB  - The burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to patients and health services is steadily increasing. Self-management supported by mobile device applications could improve outcomes for people with COPD. Our aim was to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of mobile health applications compared with usual care. A systematic review was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials. Outcomes of interest included exacerbations, physical function, and Quality of Life (QoL). Where possible, outcome data were pooled for meta-analyses. Of 1709 citations returned, 13 were eligible trials. Number of exacerbations, quality of life, physical function, dyspnea, physical activity, and self-efficacy were reported. Evidence for effectiveness was inconsistent between studies, and the pooled effect size for physical function and QoL was not significant. There was notable variation in outcome measures used across trials. Developing a standardized outcome-reporting framework for digital health interventions in COPD self-management may help standardize future research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although mobile health technologies have been developed for interventions to improve sleep disorders and sleep quality, evidence of their effectiveness remains limited. OBJECTIVE: A systematic literature review was performed to determine the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions for improving sleep disorders and sleep quality. METHODS: Four electronic databases (EBSCOhost, PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for articles on mobile technology and sleep interventions published between January 1983 and December 2016. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (1) written in English, (2) adequate details on study design, (3) focus on sleep intervention research, (4) sleep index measurement outcome provided, and (5) publication in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: An initial sample of 2679 English-language papers were retrieved from five electronic databases. After screening and review, 16 eligible studies were evaluated to examine the impact of mobile phone interventions on sleep disorders and sleep quality. These included one case study, three pre-post studies, and 12 randomized controlled trials. The studies were categorized as (1) conventional mobile phone support and (2) utilizing mobile phone apps. Based on the results of sleep outcome measurements, 88% (14/16) studies showed that mobile phone interventions have the capability to attenuate sleep disorders and to enhance sleep quality, regardless of intervention type. In addition, mobile phone intervention methods (either alternatively or as an auxiliary) provide better sleep solutions in comparison with other recognized treatments (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia). CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence to support the use of mobile phone interventions to address sleep disorders and to improve sleep quality. Our findings suggest that mobile phone technologies can be effective for future sleep intervention research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients is often suboptimal resulting in complications. There has been a growing interest in using mobile apps for improving medication adherence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to systematically review the clinical trials that have used mobile app-based interventions in T2DM patients for improving medication adherence. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was performed to identify published clinical trials between January 2008 and December 2020 in databases-PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. All studies were assessed for risk of bias using quality rating tool from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. RESULTS: Seven clinical studies having 649 participants were studied. The median sample size was 58 (range = 41-247) and the median age of participants was 53.2 (range = 48-69.4) years. All studies showed improvements in adherence; however, only three studies reported statically significant improvements in adherence measures. Selected studies were deemed as unclear in their risk of bias and the most common source of risk of bias among the studies was the absence of objective outcome assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile apps appear to be effective interventions to help improve medication adherence in T2DM patients compared with conventional care strategies. The features of the App to improvise medical adherence cannot be defined based on the meta-analysis because of heterogeneity of study designs and less number of sample size. Systematically planned studies would set up applicability of mobile apps in the clinical management of T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is common among persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the United States. It is the leading cause of mortality in this group, and efforts to promote cessation have been largely unsuccessful. METHODS: From 2015 to 2017, we performed a randomized controlled trial of Positively Smoke Free‐Mobile (PSF‐M) versus standard care. PSF‐M is a mobile Web site that offers a 42‐day text message‐based quit‐smoking program with smartphone features including quit‐day selection/calendar, educational/motivational videos, and HELP button for cravings. RESULTS: One hundred individuals enrolled, 48 were randomized to PSF‐M (mean age = 45 years, 54% male, 81% black, 31% Latino) and 52 to the standard care condition. All participants were offered a 3‐month supply of nicotine patches. Participants randomized to the mobile intervention visited the PSF‐M home page a mean of 83 times, viewed 5.6/8 videos, logged in on 13 of 42 possible days, and received 131 texts. Among them, 77% tapped HELP for cravings, and craving response options were used by the following proportions: phone‐a‐friend, 58%; play‐a‐game, 29%; play‐a‐song, 4%. Older age and nonblack race were both associated with higher levels of engagement with the site. Of participants, 61% rated PSF‐M very or extremely helpful, and 98% would recommend PSF‐M to PLWH family or friends. Abstinence at 3 months, quit attempts, and daily cigarette intake all favored PSF‐M over standard care but did not achieve statistical significance in our pilot sample. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone‐based tobacco treatment for PLWH was feasible and achieved moderate‐high rates of engagement and satisfaction in a middle‐aged, ethnic or racial minority group in the poorest urban community in the United States. IMPLICATIONS: Cigarette smoking has emerged as the leading killer of PLWH. Behavioral interventions have achieved only limited success in promoting cessation in this population. In this study, we explore the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a multimodal, Web‐based, quit‐smoking intervention delivered to PLWH smokers via their smartphones.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether a practical intervention based upon a smartphone application (app) would improve self‐management and seizure control in adults with epilepsy. Design, setting: Randomised, controlled trial in western China, December 2017 to August 2018. Participants: 380 eligible people with epilepsy were recruited; 327 completed the 6‐month follow‐up (176 in the app group, 151 in the control group). Main outcome measures: Self‐management of epilepsy (measured with the validated Chinese Epilepsy Self‐Management Scale, C‐ESMS) and self‐reported seizure frequency. Results: In the intention‐to‐treat analysis, the mean C‐ESMS score increased significantly in the app group between baseline and the 6‐month evaluation (from 121.7 [SD, 12.1] to 144.4 [SD, 10.0]; PÂ <Â 0.001); improvements on the information management, medication management, and safety management subscales were also statistically significant. At 6 months, the mean overall C‐ESMS score for the app group was significantly higher than that for the control group (125.4 [SD, 1.5]; P < 0.001). The proportion of patients who were seizure‐free at the 6‐month follow‐up was larger for the app than the control group (54 of 190, 28% v 22 of 190, 12%), as was the proportion with reductions in frequency of between 75 and 100% (22 of 190, 12% v 8 of 190, 4%). Changes in C‐ESMS score were not statistically associated with seizure frequency. Conclusions: Using a smartphone app improved epilepsy self‐management scores in people in western China. It should be further tested in larger populations in other areas. Our preliminary investigation of building digital communities for people with epilepsy should encourage similar approaches to managing other chronic diseases.

AB  - The goal of this pilot study was to test the effectiveness of a 4-week self-help protocol using a mindfulness training application delivered via smartphone for managing stress in a university student population. The study sample included 21 university undergraduate and graduate students (11 in the intervention group; 10 in the control group) whose ages ranged from 18-25 years of age (M=20.89, SD=2.18). Participants were assessed on pre- and post-intervention measures of mindfulness, using the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale--Revised (CAMS-R; Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson, & Laurenceau, 2007); psychological stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS-10; Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983); physiological stress measured by Heart Rate Variability; stereotype threat (gender stigma consciousness and ethnicity stigma consciousness) measured by the Social Identities and Attitudes Scale (SIAS; Picho & Brown, 2011); and coping style, measured by the Brief COPE (Brief COPE; Carver, 1997). Results of the study indicated that there was a significant difference in physiological stress scores [F(1,18)=5.597, p=.029] between the two groups, with a large effect size (partial eta squared was .237). The students who utilized the mindfulness training app had a larger overall decrease in physiological stress scores (i.e., increase in HRV), than did the control group, with the intervention group's post-test HRV scores increasing 2.91%, while the control group's post-test HRV scores decreased 6.01% from their pre-test HRV scores. Although not statistically significant, the intervention group exhibited a higher overall increase in mindfulness, decrease in psychological stress, decrease in stereotype threat (gender stigma consciousness and ethnicity stigma consciousness), and lower levels of maladaptive coping (denial and behavioral disengagement) than the control group. Finally, the mindfulness training app appeared to be relatively easy to use and effective for managing stress, as 90.9% of the students using the mindfulness training app rated the tasks required by the intervention as being either easy or very easy; 90.9% endorsed either agreeing or strongly agreeing that they found the intervention useful; and 81.8% endorsed either agreeing or strongly agreeing that they would suggest this type of practice for stress management.

AB  - Mobile applications reach a high number of individuals at low costs. This systematic review investigated the effectiveness of mobile application-based interventions to increase physical activity (PA) and self-efficacy and to decrease sedentarism. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs investigating the effect of PA interventions using an app compared to no intervention or traditional interventions were included. Pooled effects using the standardized mean difference (SMD) or the weighted mean difference (WMD) were calculated and the overall quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE. Eleven studies were included. In the short term, pooled estimates showed a small and positive effect in the number of steps favoring interventions using a mobile app when compared with no interventions (WMD = 1579.04, 95%CI 454.04 to 2703.38) and with traditional interventions (WMD = 665.96, 95%CI 167.92 to 1164.00). For self-efficacy and at follow-up, results favoured traditional interventions (WMD = -8.20, 95%CI -14.25 to -2.15). Non-significant results were found for the remaining comparisons. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to low. There is very low to low quality evidence that interventions using mobile apps running on smartphones, when combined with traditional interventions, are superior to traditional interventions in the short term. Further high-quality studies are required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile technologies have great potential to promote an active lifestyle in lower educated working young adults, an underresearched target group at a high risk of low activity levels. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to examine the effect and process evaluation of the newly developed evidence- and theory-based smartphone app "Active Coach" on the objectively measured total daily physical activity; self-reported, context-specific physical activity; and self-reported psychosocial variables among lower educated working young adults. METHODS: We recruited 130 lower educated working young adults in this 2-group cluster randomized controlled trial and assessed outcomes at baseline, posttest (baseline+9 weeks), and follow-up (posttest+3 months). Intervention participants (n=60) used the Active Coach app (for 9 weeks) combined with a Fitbit activity tracker. Personal goals, practical tips, and educational facts were provided to encourage physical activity. The control group received print-based generic physical activity information. Both groups wore accelerometers for objective measurement of physical activity, and individual interviews were conducted to assess the psychosocial variables and context-specific physical activity. Furthermore, intervention participants were asked process evaluation questions and generalized linear mixed models and descriptive statistics were applied. RESULTS: No significant intervention effects were found for objectively measured physical activity, self-reported physical activity, and self-reported psychosocial variables (all P>.05). Intervention participants evaluated the Active Coach app and the combined use with the Fitbit wearable as self-explanatory (36/51, 70.6%), user friendly (40/51, 78.4%), and interesting (34/51, 66.7%). Throughout the intervention, we observed a decrease in the frequency of viewing graphical displays in the app (P<.001); reading the tips, facts, and goals (P<.05); and wearing the Fitbit wearable (P<.001). Few intervention participants found the tips and facts motivating (10/41, 24.4%), used them to be physically active (8/41, 19.6%), and thought they were tailored to their lifestyle (7/41, 17.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of significant intervention effects might be due to low continuous user engagement. Advice or feedback that was not perceived as adequately tailored and the difficulty to compete with many popular commercial apps on young people's smartphones may be responsible for a decrease in the engagement. A stand-alone app does not seem sufficient to promote an active lifestyle among lower educated working young adults; therefore, multicomponent interventions (using both technological and human support), as well as context-specific sensing to provide tailored advice, might be needed in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Finding solutions to rising levels of obesity continues to be a major public health focus. Social support has an important role in successful weight loss, and digital interventions can reach a large proportion of the population at low cost. OBJECTIVE: To develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of an application (app), web- and social support-based intervention in supporting adults with obesity to achieve weight loss goals. DESIGN: Stage 1 - intervention development phase involved three focus groups (n = 10) with users, and think-aloud interviews and field testing with another group (n = 28). Stage 2 - the intervention and evaluation methods were explored in a feasibility randomised controlled trial with economic and process evaluation. SETTING: Greater Glasgow and Clyde, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with a body mass index of >= 30kg/m<sup>2</sup> who owned a smartphone and were interested in losing weight were randomised 2 : 1 (intervention : control) and followed up at 12 months. Recruitment took place in April-October 2016. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group had access to HelpMeDoIt! for 12 months. This encouraged them to (1) set goals, (2) monitor progress and (3) harness social support by inviting 'helpers' from their existing social network. The control group received a healthy lifestyle leaflet. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data from stage 1 informed the intervention design. Key measures in stage 2 assessed the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methods against prespecified progression criteria. Three primary outcomes were explored: body mass index, diet and physical activity. Secondary outcomes included weight, waist and hip circumference, social support, self-efficacy, motivation, mental health, health-related quality of life, NHS resource use, participant-borne costs and intervention costs. Qualitative interviews with participants (n = 26) and helpers (n = 9) explored the feasibility and acceptability of the trial methods and intervention. RESULTS: Stage 1 produced (1) a website that provided evidence-based information for lifestyle change and harnessing social support, and (2) an app that facilitated goal-setting, self-monitoring and supportive interaction between participants and their helper(s). Progression criteria were met, demonstrating that the intervention and trial methods were feasible and acceptable. A total of 109 participants (intervention, n = 73; control, n = 36) were recruited, with 84 participants (77%: intervention, 71%; control, 89%) followed up at 12 months. Data were successfully collected for most outcome measures (>= 82% completion). Participants and helpers were generally positive, although helper engagement with the app was low. Of the 54 (74%) participants who downloaded the app, 48 (89%) used it twice or more, 28 helpers enrolled via the app, and 19 (36%) participants interacted with their helper(s) via the app. Interview data indicated that HelpMeDoIt! prompted support from helpers that often occurred without the helpers using the app. LIMITATIONS: Early technical problems meant that some participants and helpers had difficulty accessing the app. Ethical constraints meant that we were unable to contact helpers directly for interview. CONCLUSIONS: The HelpMeDoIt! study demonstrated that a weight loss intervention delivered via an app and a website is feasible and acceptable. Progression criteria were met, supporting further evaluation of the intervention. FUTURE WORK: To further explore (1) the motivation and engagement of helpers, (2) the programme theory and (3) the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

AB  - Background: Social support has an important role in successful weight loss. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an app-, web- and social support-based intervention in supporting adults with obesity to achieve weight loss. Methods: The intervention and evaluation methods were tested in a feasibility randomised controlled trial. Adults in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area of Scotland with a body mass index >= 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited and randomised 2:1 (intervention to control). The feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and trial methods were assessed against pre-specified progression criteria, via process, economic and outcome evaluation. Three primary outcomes were explored: BMI, diet and physical activity, as well as a number of secondary outcomes. The intervention group had access to the HelpMeDoIt! intervention for 12 months. This encouraged them to (i) set goals, (ii) monitor progress and (iii) harness social support by inviting 'helpers' from their existing social network. The control group received a healthy lifestyle leaflet. Results: One hundred and nine participants were recruited, with 84 participants (77%) followed-up at 12 months. The intervention and trial methods were feasible and acceptable. Participants and helpers were generally positive. Of the 54 (74%) participants who downloaded the app, 48 (89%) used it. Interview data indicated that HelpMeDoIt! promoted social support from existing social networks to support weight loss. This support was often given outside of the app.Outcomes were compared using linear regression models, with randomised group, the baseline measurement of the outcome, age and gender as predictor variables. These analyses were exploratory and underpowered to detect effects. However, all pre-specified primary outcome effects (BMI, diet and physical activity) had wide confidence intervals and were therefore consistent with clinically relevant benefits. Objective physical activity measures perhaps showed most potential (daily step count (p = 0.098; 1187 steps [- 180, 2555])) and sedentary time (p = 0.022; - 60.8 min [- 110.5, - 11.0]). However, these outcomes were poorly completed. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that a novel social support intervention involving support from participants' close social networks, delivered via app and website, has potential to promote weight loss and is feasible and acceptable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research showed that computerized cognitive behavioral therapy can effectively reduce depressive symptoms. Some mental health apps incorporate gamification into their app design, yet it is unclear whether features differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms over and above mental health apps without gamification. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether mental health apps with gamification elements differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms when compared to those that lack these elements. METHODS: A meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of app-based therapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness, on depressive symptoms was performed. A total of 5597 articles were identified via five databases. After screening, 38 studies (n=8110 participants) remained for data extraction. From these studies, 50 total comparisons between postintervention mental health app intervention groups and control groups were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A random effects model was performed to examine the effect of mental health apps on depressive symptoms compared to controls. The number of gamification elements within the apps was included as a moderator. Results indicated a small to moderate effect size across all mental health apps in which the mental health app intervention effectively reduced depressive symptoms compared to controls (Hedges g=-0.27, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.17; P<.001). The gamification moderator was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms (β=-0.03, SE=0.03; P=.38), demonstrating no significant difference in effectiveness between mental health apps with and without gamification features. A separate meta-regression also did not show an effect of gamification elements on intervention adherence (β=-1.93, SE=2.28; P=.40). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that both mental health apps with and without gamification elements were effective in reducing depressive symptoms. There was no significant difference in the effectiveness of mental health apps with gamification elements on depressive symptoms or adherence. This research has important clinical implications for understanding how gamification elements influence the effectiveness of mental health apps on depressive symptoms.

AB  - Objective
The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with controlling their blood glucose values and receiving health and nutrition information using a smartphone app (the Pregnant+ app).

Design and participants
The study utilised the interpretative phenomenological analysis method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 participants among those participating to the randomised controlled trial. Results: The women experienced sorrow and disappointment when they were diagnosed with GDM, but they all went through a process of learning to self-manage their condition that was strongly motivated by theirdesire to care for their unborn babies. The women found that the app increased their confidence in their self management of GDM and their motivation for behavioural change. For some women, the app contributed to feelings offrustration or obsession. In addition, some technological problems and a lack of support from health-care professionals limited several women from using the app.

Key conclusions and implications for practise
The findings suggest that asmartphone app may have potential for supporting women with GDM, particularly in their blood glucose management. However, it also highlights some of the potential challenges of using mHealth technologies. The findings indicate that a closer collaboration between health-care professionals and patients is of great importance in the implementation of apps for women with GDM.

AB  - Background:Cancer treatment-induced bone loss in female breast cancer survivors affects not onlyquality of life, but also imposes a significant financial burden on national health care.Aerobic physical activity and resistance exercises can prevent bone health decline, andcan ameliorate side effects including fatigue, anxiety, depression, and muscle loss.Unfortunately, fewer than 25% of breast cancer survivors engage in and adhere toappropriate exercise routines, owing to poor awareness of the benefits of exercise, lackof motivation, and lack of access to tailored exercise programs. Web- and mobile app-based programs that encourage physical activity and exercises can address this gapand can be scaled for broader dissemination.Thrivors+Bone Health (Thrivors+BH™), is a cloud-based digital health product offeringclinically validated bone health exercises that can be customized to a survivor9s painand energy levels. The platform provides interactive feedback and supportive modulesfor social connectivity, mindfulness training, nutritional advice, survivorship resourcesand bone health-relevant educational material. The platform9s back-end measuresexercise sessions completed, utilization of supportive modules and user-reportedhealth outcomes.Methods:We conducted a single-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT03651037) with Stage 0 -Stage III exercise-naive breast cancer survivors, to evaluate adherence to a 20-weekprogram of strength training and impact exercises, delivered through Thrivors+BH™.Control arm participants accessed Thrivors Basic, a platform version lacking pain andenergy customization, interactive feedback or bone health resources. All participantswere required to engage in at least two sessions per week, comprising 14-16 differentexercises progressing from foundational to resistance and impact exercises over 20weeks. The primary endpoint, exercise adherence, was defined as the mean number ofcompleted exercise sessions per cohort. Secondary endpoints were user engagement,assessed by the Patient Activation Measure (PAM), Short Form 36v (SF-36v) and user-satisfaction surveys.Results:Demographics (n = 134) were similar between cohorts. The adherence populationanalysis (participants logging in and recording exercises for >1 week) showed that60.0% of Thrivors+BH™ participants (n = 42) completed the 20-week program,compared to 47.8% of Thrivors Basic participants (n = 48). Also, a larger percentageof Thrivors+BH™ arm participants completed between 41-60 exercise sessions,compared to Thrivors Basic participants (17.5% vs. 8.7%) Participants in both armsreported discomfort and low energy as an obstacle to exercising and emphasized theneed for more frequent updates on progress and reminders to exercise.Conclusions:The feasibility study demonstrates breast cancer survivors9 willingness to utilize adigital platform to help engage in prescribed exercise routines. Feedback fromparticipants suggest that incorporation of more personalized and interactive featuresmay encourage a higher frequency of engagement in bone-health specific exerciseand/or physical activity. A follow-up study will examine the impact of the exerciseprogram on bone health and the role of coaching to impact sustainable behaviorchange.  Citation Format: Cathy Skinner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in the United States. Although no disease-modifying therapies exist, patients with knee OA who increase walking may reduce risk of functional limitations. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a mobile app (OA GO) plus wearable activity monitor/pedometer (Jawbone UP 24) used for 90 days on the mobility of patients with knee OA treated with hylan G-F 20. METHODS: Patients with knee OA aged 30 to 80 years who were eligible to receive hylan G-F 20 and were familiar with smartphone technology were enrolled in this randomized, multicenter, open-label study. Patients who had a body mass index above 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded. All patients received a single 6-mL injection of hylan G-F 20 and wore the Jawbone monitor. The patients were then randomized 1:1 to Jawbone and OA GO (Group A; n=107) with visible feedback (unblinded) or Jawbone only (Group B; n=104) with no visible feedback (blinded). The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline in steps per day at day 90 between Groups A and B. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. There were significant differences between the increases in least squares (LS) mean number of steps per day (1199 vs 467, P=.03) and the mean percentage change (35.8% vs 11.5%, P=.02) from baseline in favor of Group A over Group B. There was a greater reduction in pain from baseline during the 6-minute walk test in Group A versus Group B. (LS mean change: -55.3 vs -33.8, P=.007). Most patients (65.4%) and surveys of physicians (67.3%) reported they would be likely or very likely to use/recommend the devices. Patient Activity Measure-13 scores improved from baseline (LS mean change for Groups A and B: 5.0 vs 6.9), with no significant differences between groups. The occurrence of adverse events was similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a novel smartphone app in conjunction with a wearable activity monitor provided additional improvement on mobility parameters such as steps per day and pain with walking in the 6-minute walk test in patients with knee OA who were treated with hylan G-F 20. Results also highlight the amenability of patients and physicians to using mobile health technology in the treatment of OA and suggest further study is warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A mobile phone‐based application can be useful for patients with type 1 diabetes in managing their disease. This results in large datasets accumulated on the patient's devices, which can be used for individualized feedback. The effect of such feedback is investigated in this article. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed an application that included a data‐driven feedback module known as Diastat for patients on self‐measured blood glucose regimens. Using a stepped‐wedge design, both groups initially received an application without Diastat. Group 1 activated Diastat after 4 weeks, whereas Group 2 activated Diastat 12 weeks after startup (T1). End points were glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level and number of out‐of‐range (OOR) measurements (i.e., outside the range 72‐270 mg/dL). RESULTS: Thirty patients were recruited to the study, and 15 were assigned to each group after the initial meeting. There were no significant differences between groups at T1 in HbA1c or OOR events. Overall, all patients had a decrease of 0.6 percentage points in mean HbA1c (P < 0.001) and 14.5 in median OOR events over 2 weeks (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The study does not provide evidence that data‐driven feedback improves glycemic control. The decrease in HbA1c was sizeable and significant, even though the study was not powered to detect this. The overall improvement in glycemic control suggests that, in general, mobile phone‐based interventions can be useful in diabetes self‐management.

AB  - Objectives: Previous research indicates that mindfulness meditation reduces anxiety and depression and enhances well-being. We examined the impact of app-delivered mindfulness meditation on resting state functional MRI (fMRI) connectivity among physician assistant (PA) students and surgery residents. Methods: PA students and residents were randomized to receive a popular meditation app or to wait-list control group. Before and after the 8-week meditation period, we acquired fMRI scans of participants' resting state, and participants completed a self-report measure of mindfulness. We used a 2 x 2, within- and between-group factorial design and leveraged a whole-brain connectome approach to examine changes in within- and between-network connectivity across the entire brain, and to examine whether changes in connectivity were associated with app use or to changes in self-reported mindfulness. Results: Meditation practitioners exhibited significantly stronger connectivity between the frontoparietal network and the left and right nucleus accumbens and between the default mode (DMN) and salience networks, among other regions. Mindfulness practice time was correlated with increased connectivity between the lateral parietal cortex and the supramarginal gyrus, which were also positively correlated with increased scores on the "Describing" subscale of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire between baseline and post-meditation. These findings are consistent with previous research indicating that mindfulness-based interventions alter functional connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and other networks both during meditation and at rest, as well as increased connectivity in systems important for emotion and reward. Conclusions: Recent commentaries call for healthcare provider and trainee wellness programs that are sustainable and preventive in nature rather than reactive; these data indicate that even brief sessions of app-delivered mindfulness practice are associated with functional connectivity changes in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care provider and trainee burnout results in substantial national and institutional costs and profound social effects. Identifying effective solutions and interventions to cultivate resilience among health care trainees is critical. Although less is known about the mental health needs of physician assistants (PAs) or PA students, accumulating research indicates that they experience similarly alarming rates of burnout, depression, and emotional exhaustion. Mobile app-delivered mindfulness meditation may be an effective part of salubrious programming to bolster long-term resilience and health among PA students. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the impact of app-delivered mindfulness meditation on self-reported mental health symptoms among PA students. A secondary aim is to investigate changes in brain connectivity to identify neurobiological changes related to changes in mental health symptoms. METHODS: We recruited PA students enrolled in their third semester of PA school and used a longitudinal, randomized, wait-list-controlled design. Participants randomized to the mindfulness group were provided 1-year subscriptions to the 10% Happier app, a consumer-based meditation app, and asked to practice every day for 8 weeks. Before randomization and again after completion of the 8-week program, all participants completed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging as well as self-report assessments of burnout, depression, anxiety, and sleep impairment. App use was acquired as a measure of mindfulness practice time. RESULTS: PA students randomized to the mindfulness group reported improvements in sleep impairment compared with those randomized to the wait-list control group (eta<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.42; P=.01). Sleep impairment decreased significantly in the mindfulness group (19% reduction; P=.006) but not in the control group (1% reduction; P=.71). There were no other significant changes in mental health for those randomized to app-delivered mindfulness. Across all students, changes in sleep impairment were associated with increased resting-state functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (a component of the default mode network) and the superior temporal gyrus, as well as between areas important for working memory. Changes in connectivity predicted categorical conversion from impaired to nonimpaired sleep in the mindfulness group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study is the first to examine app-based mindfulness for PA students' mental health and investigate the impact of mindfulness on PA students' brain function. These findings suggest that app-delivered mindfulness may be an effective tool to improve sleep dysfunction and that it may be an important part of the programming necessary to reduce the epidemic of suffering among health profession trainees.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a consumer‐based mobile meditation application (app) on wellness in outpatient obstetric and gynecology patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at a university outpatient clinic of obstetric and gynecology patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention group, who was prescribed a mobile meditation app for 30 days, or the control group, which received standard care. The primary outcome was self‐reported perceived stress. Secondary outcomes included self‐reported depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and satisfaction with the meditation app. A sample size of 80 participants (40 per group) was calculated to achieve 84% power to detect a 3‐point difference in the primary outcome. RESULTS: From April to May 2020, 101 women were randomized in the study‐50 in the meditation app group and 51 in the control group. Analysis was by intention‐to‐treat. Most characteristics were similar between groups. Perceived stress was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (mean difference 4.27, 95% CI 1.30‐7.24, P=.005, d=0.69 and mean difference 4.28, 95% CI 1.68‐6.88, P=.002, d=0.69, respectively). Self‐reported depression and anxiety were significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (depression: P=.002 and P=.04; anxiety: P=.01, and P=.04, respectively). Sleep disturbance was significantly less in the intervention group at days 14 and 30 (P=.001 and P=.02, respectively). More than 80% of those in the intervention group reported high satisfaction with the meditation app, and 93% reported that mindfulness meditation improved their stress. CONCLUSION: Outpatient obstetric and gynecology patients who used the prescribed consumer‐based mobile meditation app during the COVID‐19 pandemic had significant reductions in perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance compared with standard care.

AB  - Background/aims: Many cancer survivors who received intensive treatment such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) experience posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. PTSD is associated with lower quality of life and other symptoms that require clinical treatment. The iterative treatment decisions that happen in clinical practice are not adequately represented in traditional randomized controlled trials (RCT) of PTSD treatments. The proposed stepped‐care SMART design allows for evaluation of initial response to the Cancer Distress Coach mobile app; adaptive stepped‐care interventions; and precision treatment strategies that tailor treatment selection to patient characteristics. Methods/design: HCT survivors (N = 400) reporting PTSD symptoms are being recruited at two cancer centers and randomly assigned to: 1) Cancer Distress Coach app or 2) Usual Care. The app includes educational and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)‐based activities. Four weeks post‐randomization, participants re‐rate their PTSD symptoms and, based on intervention response, non‐responders are re‐randomized to receive video‐conferenced sessions with a therapist: 3) coaching sessions in using the mobile app; or 4) CBT specific to HCT survivors. Participants complete outcome measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety after Months 1, 3, and 6. Participant characteristics moderating intervention responses will be examined. Conclusions: This novel adaptive trial design will afford evidence that furthers knowledge about optimizing PTSD interventions for HCT survivors. To our knowledge, this study is the first SMART design evaluating PTSD symptom management in cancer survivors. If successful, it could be used to optimize treatment among a range of cancer and other trauma survivors.

AB  - Background: Interval walking training has demonstrated more pronounced positive effects on physical fitness and metabolism in type 2 diabetes (T2D), compared to continuous walking. One of the pathogenic mechanisms of T2D is associated with derangements in leptin/adiponectin axis, which might predispose affected individuals to vascular inflammation and albuminuria. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of interval walking training delivered through smart mobile devices upon albuminuria and leptin/adiponectin ratio in patients with T2D. Methods: Patients with T2D aged 35–75 were randomized into control (n = 26) and interval training (IT, n = 14) groups. Patients in IT group had to perform three 60‐min interval walking sessions (3 min intervals of slow and fast walking with the intensity of 40% and 70% of the peak energy expenditure) per week delivered by smartphone application for four months. The adherence to training was monitored remotely. Outcome measures were albuminuria, leptin/adiponectin ratio, obesity indicators, and glycaemic control. Leptin and adiponectin concentration was measured in serum samples by Luminex technology. Results: In the IT group compared to control group, we observed a statistically significant decrease in albuminuria (p =.002) and leptin/adiponectin ratio (p =.01), as well as a decrease in HbA1c close to statistical significance (p =.09). In IT group, changes in leptin/adiponectin ratio correlated significantly with changes in hip circumference (p =.024). Conclusion: Interval walking training is beneficial for vascular health in T2D via impact on albuminuria and leptin/adiponectin ratio.

AB  - Objective: This waiting‐list randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of a self‐management mHealth app in improving fatigue and quality of life (QoL) in cancer patients and survivors. Methods: Persons with cancer‐related fatigue (CRF) were recruited across four English speaking countries, via social media, and randomized into intervention (n = 519) and control (n = 280) groups. Whereas the intervention group received immediate access to the Untire app, the control group received access only after 12‐weeks. Primary outcomes fatigue severity and interference, and secondary outcome QoL were assessed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12‐weeks. We ran generalized linear mixed models for all outcomes to determine the effects of app access (yes/no), over 12‐weeks, following the intention‐to‐treat principle. Results: Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed significantly larger improvements in fatigue severity (d = 0.40), fatigue interference (d = 0.35), and overall QoL on average (d = 0.32) (P's <.01), but not for overall QoL in the past week (P =.07). Sensitivity analyses indicated that participants with medium or high app use benefited most when compared with nonusers and control participants (P's ≤.02). The intervention effect on fatigue interference was slightly stronger in younger participants (≤56 vs. >56). Effects did not depend on education and cancer status. Reliable change analyses indicated that significantly more people showed full recovery for fatigue in the intervention vs the control group (P's =.02). Conclusions: The Untire app can be an effective mHealth solution for cancer patients and survivors with moderate to severe CRF.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects on weight loss of three abbreviated behavioral weight loss interventions with and without coaching and mobile technology. METHODS: A randomized controlled efficacy study of three 6‐month weight loss treatments was conducted in 96 adults with obesity: 1) self‐guided (SELF), 2) standard (STND), or 3) technology‐supported (TECH). STND and TECH received eight in‐person group treatment sessions. SELF and STND used paper diaries to self‐monitor diet, activity, and weight; TECH used a smartphone application with social networking features and wireless accelerometer. RESULTS: Weight loss was greater for TECH and STND than SELF at 6 months (‐5.7 kg [95% confidence interval: ‐7.2 to ‐4.1] vs. ‐2.7 kg [95% confidence interval: ‐5.1 to ‐0.3], P < 0.05) but not 12 months. TECH and STND did not differ except that more STND (59%) than TECH (34%) achieved ≥ 5% weight loss at 6 months (P < 0.05). Self‐monitoring adherence was greater in TECH than STND (P < 0.001), greater in both interventions than SELF (P < 0.001), and covaried with weight loss (r(84) = 0.36‐0.51, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Abbreviated behavioral counseling can produce clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of whether self‐monitoring is performed on paper or smartphone, but long‐term superiority over standard of care self‐guided treatment is challenging to maintain.

AB  - Lay theories about the malleability of human attributes, also known as fixed and growth mindsets, have been shown to impact behavior in many domains. The goal of this work was to measure and test the role of mindsets in nicotine addiction. In Study 1, data (N = 600) from both current smokers and non-smokers led to the development of a single-factor 6-item measure of mindset called the Addiction Mindset Scale (AMS). In Study 2, a survey of daily smokers (N = 200) showed that higher scores on the AMS, indicative of growth mindset, were positively and significantly associated with greater motivation to quit, greater commitment to quitting, greater self-efficacy to abstain, greater attribution of failure to lack of effort as opposed to ability, and fewer self-reported barriers to cessation (all p's < .05). In Study 3, participants (N = 398) were randomly assigned to receive a growth mindset intervention or to a control group that did not receive anything. All participants were provided a smartphone application (app) that taught them skills to quit smoking and their cessation and engagement with the app were assessed after two months (92% outcome data retention). The groups did not differ on engagement with the quit-smoking app, but the intervention group showed descriptively higher quit rates. A per protocol analysis showed that participants who used the programs as intended showed greater engagement with the app and higher odds of cessation. Taken together, the studies illustrate the relationship between addiction mindset and smoking cessation and underscore the promise of a growth mindset intervention to change addictive behaviors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although smartphone apps have shown promise for smoking cessation, there is a need to enhance their low engagement rates. This study evaluated the application of the growth mindset theory, which has demonstrated the potential to improve persistence in behavior change in other domains, as a means to improve engagement and cessation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the feasibility, utility, and efficacy of a Web‐based growth mindset intervention for addiction when used alongside a smoking cessation app. METHODS: Daily smokers (N=398) were all recruited on the Web and randomly assigned to receive either a cessation app alone or the app plus a Web‐delivered growth mindset intervention. The primary outcome was engagement, that is, the number of log‐ins to the smoking cessation app. The secondary outcome was 30‐day point prevalence abstinence at 2‐month follow‐up collected through a Web‐based survey. RESULTS: The 2‐month outcome data retention rate was 91.5% (364/398). In addition, 77.9% (310/398) of the participants in the experimental arm viewed at least 1 page of their growth mindset intervention, and 21.1% (84/398) of the group viewed all the growth mindset intervention. The intention‐to‐treat analysis did not show statistically significant differences between the experimental and comparison arms on log‐ins to the app (19.46 vs 21.61; P=.38). The experimental arm had cessation rates, which trended higher than the comparison arm (17% vs 13%; P=.10). The modified intent‐to‐treat analysis, including only participants who used their assigned intervention at least once (n=115 in experimental group and n=151 in the control group), showed that the experimental arm had a similar number of log‐ins (32.31 vs 28.48; P=.55) but significantly higher cessation rates (21% vs 13%; P=.03) than the comparison arm. CONCLUSIONS: A growth mindset intervention for addiction did not increase engagement rates, although it may increase cessation rates when used alongside a smartphone app for smoking cessation. Future research is required to refine the intervention and assess efficacy with long‐term follow‐up to evaluate the efficacy of the mindset intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile apps for problematic substance use have the potential to bypass common barriers to treatment seeking. Ten years following the release of the first app targeting problematic tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, their effectiveness, use, and acceptability remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a systematic literature review of trials evaluating mobile app interventions for problematic tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use. METHODS: The review was conducted according to recommended guidelines. Relevant databases were searched, and articles were included if the mobile app study was a controlled intervention trial and reported alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug consumption as outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies met eligibility criteria across a range of substances: alcohol (n=11), tobacco (n=6), alcohol and tobacco (n=1), illicit drugs (n=1), and illicit drugs and alcohol (n=1). Samples included the general community, university students, and clinical patients. The analyzed intervention sample sizes ranged from 22 to 14,228, and content was considerably diverse, from simple stand-alone apps delivering self-monitoring or psychoeducation to multicomponent apps with interactive features and audio content, or used as adjuncts alongside face-to-face treatment. Intervention duration ranged from 1 to 35 weeks, with notifications ranging from none to multiple times per day. A total of 6 of the 20 app interventions reported significant reductions in substance use at post or follow-up compared with a comparison condition, with small to moderate effect sizes. Furthermore, two other app interventions reported significant reductions during the intervention but not at post treatment, and a third reported a significant interaction of two app intervention components. CONCLUSIONS: Although most app interventions were associated with reductions in problematic substance use, less than one-third were significantly better than the comparison conditions at post treatment. A total of 5 out of the 6 apps that reported intervention effects targeted alcohol (of those, one targeted alcohol and illicit drugs and another alcohol and tobacco) and 1 targeted tobacco. Moreover, 3 out of 6 apps included feedback (eg, personalized) and 2 had high risk of bias, 1 some risk, and 3 low risk. All 6 apps included interventions of 6 weeks or longer. Common study limitations were small sample sizes; risk of bias; lack of relevant details; and, in some cases, poorly balanced comparison conditions. Appropriately powered trials are required to understand which app interventions are most effective, length of engagement required, and subgroups most likely to benefit. In sum, evidence to date for the effectiveness of apps targeting problematic substance use is not compelling, although the heterogeneous comparison conditions and trial designs across studies limit the ability to compare efficacy between apps. We discuss potential approaches that can help ascertain whether the promise of mobile app interventions for problematic substance use can be fulfilled.

AB  - Background
Mental health apps have the potential to decrease the burden of disease associated with mental illness. However, few apps have been evaluated for effectiveness.

Objective
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the strengths‐focused My Coping Plan app in improving mental health and coping.

Methods
Participants were 56 Australian University students with self‐reported elevated levels of distress (K10 total ≥ 16). Participants were randomly allocated to the intervention (My Coping Plan) or waitlist control condition.

Results
At 1‐month follow‐up, participants in the intervention condition reported significantly lower psychological distress (d = 0.31), improved wellbeing (d = −0.42) and improved healthy coping strategies (d = 0.39) compared with the control condition. There was no significant difference between groups in reported unhealthy coping strategies. The majority of participants downloaded the app and made a coping plan. Just over half used their plan when they were distressed.

Conclusions
The My Coping Plan app can improve mental health and wellbeing in the short‐term, likely through increased self‐efficacy. Professional support may be necessary to support long‐term use of healthy coping strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over 100 million individuals have high blood pressure, and more than half of them are women. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is a proven lifestyle approach to lower blood pressure, yet population‐level adherence is poor. Innovative strategies that promote DASH are needed. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to improve adherence to the DASH diet among women with hypertension or prehypertension. METHODS: We conducted a 3‐month randomized controlled feasibility trial comparing app‐based diet tracking (active comparator) to app‐based diet tracking plus feedback on DASH adherence via text message (intervention). The intervention platform extracted nutrient data from the app, compared it to DASH recommendations, and sent tailored feedback text messages. Outcomes included the number of days participants tracked their diet, changes in their DASH adherence score, and blood pressure. RESULTS: The women (N=59) had a mean age of 49.9 (SD 11.9) years and were primarily non‐Hispanic White (41/59, 69%) and college educated (49/59, 83%). The mean baseline DASH score was 2.3 (SD 1.3). At 3 months, the intervention and active comparator participants had similar mean days tracked per week (4.2, SD 2.1 days vs 4.6, SD 2.7 days; P=.54) and mean changes in their DASH score (0.8, 95% CI 0.2‐1.5 vs 0.8, 95% CI 0.4‐1.2; P=.75). Intervention participants had lower systolic (mean difference: ‐2.8 mmHg, 95% CI ‐1.8 to 7.4; P=.23) and diastolic (mean difference: ‐3.6 mmHg, 95% CI ‐0.2 to 7.3; P=.07) blood pressure compared with active comparator participants. Most intervention participants (23/29, 79%) said they would recommend the DASH Cloud intervention to a friend or family member. However, only 34% (10/59) indicated that the feedback text messages helped them reach their diet goals. CONCLUSIONS: A digital health intervention to improve DASH adherence is feasible and produces moderately high engagement among women with elevated blood pressure. The intervention did not enhance DASH adherence over diet tracking alone but resulted in greater reductions in blood pressure. Larger studies are needed to determine how digital health interventions can improve population‐level adherence to DASH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Office work generally consists of high amounts of sedentary behaviour (SB) which has been associated with negative health consequences. We developed the "WorktivIty" mobile app to help office workers reduce their SB through self‐monitoring and feedback on sedentary time, prompts to break sedentary time, and educational facts. The aim of this paper is to report the feasibility of delivering the Worktivity intervention to desk‐based office workers in the workplace setting and describe methodological considerations for a future trial. METHODS: We conducted a three‐arm feasibility cluster randomised controlled pilot study over an 8‐week period with full time‐desk based employees. Clustered randomisation was to one of three groups: Worktivity mobile app (MA; n = 20), Worktivity mobile app plus SSWD (MA+SSWD; n = 20), or Control (C; n = 16). Feasibility was assessed using measures of recruitment and retention, intervention engagement, intervention delivery, completion rates and usable data, adverse events, and acceptability. RESULTS: Recruitment of companies to participate in this study was challenging (8% of those contacted), but retention of individual participants within the recruited groups was high (81% C, 90% MA + SSWD, 95% MA). Office workers' engagement with the app was moderate (on average 59%). Intervention delivery was partially compromised due to diminishing user engagement and technical issues related to educational fact delivery. Sufficient amounts of useable data were collected, however either missing or unusable data were observed with activPAL™, with data loss increasing at each follow up time point. No serious adverse events were identified during the study. The majority of participants agreed that the intervention could be implemented within the workplace setting (65% MA; 72% MA + SSWD) but overall satisfaction with the intervention was modest (58% MA; 39% MA + SSWD). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that, in principle, it is feasible to implement a mobile app‐based intervention in the workplace setting however the Worktivity intervention requires further technical refinements before moving to effectiveness trials. Challenges relating to the initial recruitment of workplaces and maintaining user engagement with the mHealth intervention over time need to be addressed prior to future large‐scale implementation. Further research is needed to identify how best to overcome these challenges.

AB  - Personality traits predict important life outcomes, such as success in love and work life, well‐being, health, and longevity. Given these positive relations to important outcomes, economists, policy makers, and scientists have proposed intervening to change personality traits to promote positive life outcomes. However, nonclinical interventions to change personality traits are lacking so far in large‐scale naturalistic populations. This study (n = 1,523) examined the effects of a 3‐mo digital personality change intervention using a randomized controlled trial and the smartphone application PEACH (PErsonality coACH). Participants who received the intervention showed greater self‐reported changes compared to participants in the waitlist control group who had to wait 1 mo before receiving the intervention. Self‐reported changes aligned with intended goals for change and were significant for those desiring to increase on a trait (d = 0.52) and for those desiring to decrease on a trait (d = −0.58). Observers such as friends, family members, or intimate partners also detected significant personality changes in the desired direction for those desiring to increase on a trait (d = 0.35). Observer‐reported changes for those desiring to decrease on a trait were not significant (d = −0.22). Moreover, self‐ and observer‐reported changes persisted until 3 mo after the end of the intervention. This work provides the strongest evidence to date that normal personality traits can be changed through intervention in nonclinical samples.

AB  - Depression is common in primary care settings, but barriers prevent many primary care patients from initiating treatment. Smartphone apps stand as a possible means to overcome such barriers. However, there is limited evidence to understand the use and efficacy of these apps. The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait‐list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait‐list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4‐week follow‐up period; wait‐list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks. A repeated‐measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine depression over time and across treatment groups; t tests compared app usage across groups. Depression scores changed significantly over time (p < .001), with group differences occurring between Thought Challenger and wait‐list control participants (p = .03). Boost Me was used significantly more than was Thought Challenger (p = .02); however, there was no evidence to suggest correlations between usage and changes in depression (ps > .05). The present study provides initial support that intervention strategies for depression delivered via apps with human support can impact symptoms and may promote continued use over 6 weeks. This pilot also demonstrates the feasibility of future research regarding the delivery of behavioral and cognitive intervention strategies via apps.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Internet‐based cognitive‐behavioral treatments (ICBT) have shown promise for various mental disorders, including social anxiety disorder (SAD). Most of these treatments have been delivered on desktop computers. However, the use of smartphones is becoming ubiquitous and could extend the reach of ICBT into users' everyday life. Only a few studies have empirically examined the efficacy of ICBT delivered through a smartphone app and there is no published study on mobile app delivered ICBT for SAD. This three‐arm randomized‐controlled trial (RCT) is the first to compare the efficacy of guided ICBT for smartphones (app) and conventional computers (PC) with a wait list control group (WL). METHOD: A total of 150 individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria for SAD were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. Primary endpoints were self‐report measures and diagnostic status of SAD. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, both active conditions showed superior outcome on the composite of all SAD measures (PC vs. WL: d = 0.74; App vs. WL: d = 0.89) and promising diagnostic response rates (NNTPC = 3.33; NNTApp = 6.00) compared to the WL. No significant between‐groups effects were found between the two active conditions on the composite score (Cohen's d = 0.07). Treatment gains were maintained at 3‐month follow‐up. Program use was more evenly spread throughout the day in the mobile condition, indicating an integration of the program into daily routines. CONCLUSIONS: ICBT can be delivered effectively using smartphones. (PsycINFO Database Record

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous mobile apps available for download are geared toward health and fitness; however, limited research has evaluated the real‐world effectiveness of such apps. The movr app is a mobile health app designed to enhance physical functioning by prescribing functional movement training based on individualized movement assessments. The influence of the movr app on functional movement and physical fitness (flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness) has not yet been established empirically. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the real‐world impact of the movr app on functional movement, flexibility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness. METHODS: A total of 48 healthy adults (24 women and 24 men; mean age 24, SD 5 years) completed an 8‐week pilot pragmatic randomized controlled trial in which they were randomly assigned to either 8‐week use of the movr app (n=24) or 8‐week waitlist control (n=24). Measures of functional movement (Functional Movement Screen [FMS]), strength (push‐ups, handgrip strength, and countermovement jump), flexibility (shoulder flexibility, sit and reach, active straight leg raise [ASLR], and half‐kneeling dorsiflexion), and cardiovascular fitness (maximal oxygen uptake []) were collected at baseline and the 8‐week follow‐up. RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses of variance revealed significant group‐by‐time interactions for the 100‐point FMS (P<.001), shoulder flexibility (P=.01), ASLR (P=.001), half‐kneeling dorsiflexion (P<.001), and push‐up tests (P=.03). Pairwise comparisons showed that FMS scores increased from pre‐ to postintervention for those in the movr group (P<.001) and significantly decreased for those in the control group (P=.04). For shoulder flexibility, ASLR, half‐kneeling dorsiflexion, and push‐up tests, improvements from pre‐ to postintervention were found in the movr group (all values of P<.05) but not in the control group (all values of P>.05). There were no changes in the sit and reach or handgrip strength test scores for either group (all values of P>.05). A significant main effect of time was found for the countermovement jump (P=.02), such that scores decreased from pre‐ to postintervention in the control group (P=.02) but not in the movr group (P=.38). Finally, a significant group‐by‐time interaction was found for (P=.001), revealing that scores decreased pre‐ to postintervention in the control group (P<.001), but not in the movr group (P=.54). CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed that movr improved indices of functional movement (FMS), flexibility (shoulder, ASLR, and dorsiflexion), and muscular endurance (push‐ups) over an 8‐week period compared with the control group while maintaining handgrip strength, lower body power (countermovement jump), and cardiovascular fitness (). Thus, this study provides initial evidence of the effectiveness of the movr app for enhancing functional movement and physical fitness among healthy adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is a common global health problem and increases the risk of many chronic illnesses. Given the adverse effects of antiobesity agents and bariatric surgeries, the exploration of noninvasive and nonpharmacological complementary methods for weight reduction is warranted. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine whether self-administered auricular acupressure (AA) integrated with a smartphone app was more effective than using AA alone or the controls for weight reduction. METHODS: This study is a 3-arm randomized waitlist-controlled feasibility trial. A total of 59 eligible participants were randomly divided into either group 1 (AA group, n=19), group 2 (AA plus smartphone app, n=19), or group 3 (waitlist control, n=21). A total of 6 reflective zones or acupoints for weight reduction were chosen. The smartphone app could send out daily messages to the subjects to remind them to perform self-pressing on the 6 ear acupoints. A "date picker" of the 8-week treatment course was used to enable the users to input the compliance of pressing and the number of bowel movement daily instead of using the booklet for recordings. The app also served as a reminder for the subjects regarding the dates for returning to the center for acupoint changing and assessments. Treatment was delivered 2 times a week, for 8 weeks. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine the interactions among the groups before and after intervention. RESULTS: Subjects in group 2 expressed that the smartphone app was useful (7.41 out of 10). The most popular features were the daily reminders for performing self-pressing (88%), the ear diagram indicating the locations and functions of the 6 ear points (71%), and ear pressing method demonstrated in the video scripts (47%). Nearly 90% of the participants completed the 8-week intervention, with a high satisfaction toward the overall arrangement (8.37 out of 10). The subjects in group 1 and 2 achieved better therapeutic effects in terms of body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and hip circumference and perceived more fullness before meals than the waitlist controls. Although no significant differences in the pairwise comparisons between the 2 groups were detected (P>.05), the decrease in body weight, BMI, body fat, visceral fat rating and leptin level, and increase in adiponectin level were notable in group 2 before and after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The high compliance rate and high satisfaction toward the trial arrangement indicate that AA can be used to achieve weight reduction and applied in future large-scale studies. AA integrated with the smartphone app has a more notable effect than using AA alone for weight reduction. Larger sample size should be considered in future trials to determine the causal relationship between treatment and effect.

AB  - Alcohol‐specific attentional biases (AttB) and approach biases (AppB) are postulated to play a role in alcohol use disorders but their association with drinking in young adults remains unknown. A subsample of young adults with risky alcohol use (N = 296) enrolled in a randomized trial, testing different text message interventions completed weekly tasks via a mobile app for up to 14 weeks: Alcohol Stroop was used to measure AttB and Approach‐Avoidance Task was used to measure AppB. Participants also provided reports of their alcohol consumption up to twice per week. We analyzed feasibility of measuring alcohol biases on mobile phones, whether repeated testing and conditions of testing affected mean reaction times (RTs), and whether mean AttB and AppB scores were associated with baseline alcohol use severity and same‐day binge drinking (4+/5+ drinks per occasion for women/men). Task completion decreased from 93% on Week 1% to 39% by Week 14 with a mean of 8.2 weeks completed. Mean RTs for Alcohol Stroop decreased over weeks assessed. RTs to Stroop and Approach‐Avoid tasks were longer when participants reported distractions or after alcohol and/or drug use. Mean AttB and AppB scores were not associated with baseline drinking, and within‐day fluctuations of AttB and AppB scores did not predict same day binge drinking. Barriers to measuring alcohol biases in the natural environment include learning effects, contextual influences of distractions and prior alcohol/drug use, and absence of robust associations of RTs to alcohol cues with either baseline or same‐day alcohol consumption.

AB  - This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of a mindfulness‐based mobile health (mHealth) intervention, tailored to the pandemic context, among young adult students (N = 114) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms during quarantine in China, compared to a time‐ and attention‐matched social support‐based mHealth control. At baseline, postintervention (1 month), and 2‐month follow‐up, participants completed self‐reports of primary outcomes (anxiety and depression), secondary outcomes (mindfulness and social support), and emotional suppression as a culturally relevant mechanism of change. Feasibility and acceptability were also evaluated. Using intent‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis, linear mixed effects models showed that compared to social support mHealth, mindfulness mHealth had a superior effect on anxiety (p = .024, between‐group d = 0.72). Both conditions improved on depression (baseline‐to‐FU ds > 1.10, between‐group difference not significant, d = 0.36 favoring mindfulness). There was an interaction of Emotional suppression reduction × Condition in the improvement of anxiety and depression. Further, mindfulness mHealth was demonstrated to be more feasible and acceptable in program engagement, evaluation, skills improvement, and perceived benefit. Retention was high in both conditions (>80%). The difference in self‐reported adverse effect was nonsignificant (3.9% in mindfulness and 8.7% in social support). Results of this pilot trial suggest that both mindfulness and social support, delivered via mHealth, show promise in reducing distress among young adults in quarantine, with mindfulness being particularly effective in addressing anxiety. Successful implementation and dissemination of this mHealth intervention approach have the potential for addressing the psychological consequences of the pandemic.

AB  - Background and aims: Associated with severe complications and morbidity, Diabetes Mellitus is a significant public health burden. The need for regular monitoring and adherence to treatment and lifestyle changes have a high impact on the quality of life of the patients. This study attempts to assess the effect of smartphone‐based lifestyle modification intervention in the quality of life of patients with type 2 Diabetes through a randomized filed trial. Methods: A randomized field trial was performed among the patients attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Mysuru city. A mobile application named DIAGURU, mainly focusing on the lifestyle modification and medication management was used for a period of 6 months from April 2019 to September 2019 by 150 patients in the intervention group while another 150 participants served as controls. The quality of life was assessed using the WHO QOL BREF questionnaire at the beginning of the study and after six months. Results: The change in the quality of life in a positive direction was significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the non‐intervention group after six months. The differences in the change in scores of quality of life of participants recruited in intervention and non‐intervention groups were statistically significant in all the four domains after the intervention with a p value < 0.001. Conclusion: The evidence generated in this study suggest that such technological approaches can be used as a public health measure to improve the quality of life of patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

AB  - Introduction: Diabetes Mellitus is a major chronic disease associated with many complications and high morbidity. The need for lifestyle modification and regular adherent treatment makes the management of the disease difficult. This study examines the scope of m‐Health in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in terms of glycemic control. Methods: A randomized controlled study was performed among the patients attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital in Mysuru city. A mobile application named DIAGURU, mainly focusing on lifestyle modification and medication management was used for a period of 6 months from April 2019 to September 2019 by 150 patients in the study group while another 150 participants served as controls. The change in glycosylated haemoglobin levels was assessed after six months. Results: The mean HbA1C levels at the starting of the study was found to be 7.36% ± 1.04 in the study group and 7.84% ± 1.33% in the control group. A repeat HbA1c test after six months showed a mean level of 7.10% ± 0.96% among the participants who received the intervention and 7.97% ± 1.37% among the control group. The values were showing a trend of reduction in the intervention group, with a median reduction HbA1c of −0.2% (−0.3% to −0.2%). Among the participants who did not receive our intervention, a median increase of 0.1% (0%–0.2%) in HbA1c was noticed. Mann Whitney U test was performed, and it showed a statistically significant association with a p value less than 0.001. Conclusion: From this study, we conclude that an intervention with a mobile application aimed at lifestyle modification and medication management in addition to regular medical treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients resulted in a better glycemic control compared to a control group who did not receive the adjuvant intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Topical corticosteroid or corticosteroid/calcipotriol preparations are recommended first‐line topical treatments of psoriasis, but a main cause for the lack of efficacy of topical treatments is considered low rates of adherence to topical drugs. Patient support by the use of applications (apps) for smartphones is suggested to improve medical adherence. METHODS/DESIGN: Design: An investigator‐initiated, single‐center, single‐blind, parallel‐group, phase‐4 clinical superiority randomized controlled trial (RCT). PARTICIPANTS: 134 patients 18 to 75 years of age with mild‐to‐moderate psoriasis, who are capable of reading English language, own a smartphone, and are candidates for the study drug calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) cutaneous foam once daily prn (pro re nata). INTERVENTION: A 28‐day adherence‐supporting app providing compulsory daily treatment reminders that pop‐up on the smartphone screen with a short alert sound. The app synchronizes through Bluetooth® to an electronic monitor (EM) attached to the medication canister. The EM contains a chip registering the amount of foam, day and time the patient use the foam dispenser. The information is displayed in a diary that shows the amount of Cal/BD cutaneous foam used and the number of applied treatment sessions. The app has an optional diary with the patient's rating of symptoms. Non‐intervention: Use of Cal/BD cutaneous foam and EM without the app. All participants are prescribed Cal/BD cutaneous foam prn for the entire study period. Primary outcome obtained in week 4: rates of adherence measured by patient report, weight of medication canisters, and number of treatment sessions measured by the EM. Secondary outcomes obtained at baseline, weeks 4, 8, and 26: Lattice System Physician's Global Assessment (LS‐PGA) and Dermatology Quality of Life Index (DLQI). DISCUSSION: This trial tests of whether an app can improve rates of adherence to a topical antipsoriatic drug. If the app improves rates of adherence and reduces the burden of psoriasis in a clinically significant way, the app could easily be implemented as a standard routine of care in the clinic. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02858713 , registered on August 3, 2016. EudraCT number 2016‐002143‐42.

AB  - Background: Adherence to topical psoriasis treatments is low, which leads to unsatisfactory treatment results. Smartphone applications (apps) for patient support exist but their potential to improve adherence has not been systematically evaluated. Objectives: To evaluate whether a study‐specific app improves adherence and reduces psoriasis symptoms compared with standard treatment. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT, clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT02858713). Patients received once‐daily medication [calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) cutaneous foam] and were randomized to no app (n = 66) or app intervention (n = 68) groups. In total, 122 patients (91%) completed the 22‐week follow‐up. The primary outcome was adherence, which was defined as medication applied ≥ 80% of days during the treatment period and assessed by a chip integrated into the medication dispenser. Secondary outcomes were psoriasis severity measured by the Lattice System Physician's Global Assessment (LS‐PGA) and quality of life, measured using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) at all visits. Results: Intention‐to‐treat analyses using regression was performed. More patients in the intervention group were adherent to Cal/BD cutaneous foam than those in the nonintervention group at week 4 (65% vs. 38%, P = 0·004). The intervention group showed a greater LS‐PGA reduction than the nonintervention group at week 4 (mean 1·86 vs. 1·46, P = 0·047). A similar effect was seen at weeks 8 and 26, although it did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: This RCT demonstrates that the app improved short‐term adherence to Cal/BD cutaneous foam treatment and psoriasis severity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the effect of a smartphone application on exercise adherence, range of motion and self‐efficacy compared to standard rehabilitation after repair of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon. DESIGN: Prospective multi‐centre randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Four hand surgery departments in Sweden. SUBJECTS: A total of 101 patients (35 women) (mean age 37.5 ± 12.8) were randomised to control (n = 49) or intervention group (n = 52). INTERVENTION: A smartphone application to facilitate rehabilitation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence assessed with the Sport Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale at two and six weeks (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were self‐reported adherence in three domains assessed at two and six weeks, self‐efficacy assessed with Athlete Injury Self‐Efficacy Questionnaire at baseline, two and six weeks. Range of motion and perceived satisfaction with rehabilitation and information were assessed at 12 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty‐five patients were lost to follow‐up. There was no significant between group difference in Sport Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale at two or six weeks, mean scores (confidence interval, CI 95%) 12.5 (CI 11.8‐13.3), 11.8 (CI 11.0‐12.8) for the intervention group, and 13.3 (CI 12.6‐14.0), 12.8 (CI 12.0‐13.7) for the control group. Self‐reported adherence for exercise frequency at six weeks was significantly better for the intervention group, 93.2 (CI 86.9‐99.5) compared to the controls 82.9 (CI 76.9‐88.8) (P = 0.02). There were no differences in range of motion, self‐efficacy or satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The smartphone application used in this study did not improve adherence, self‐efficacy or range of motion compared to standard rehabilitation for flexor tendon injuries. Further research regarding smartphone applications is needed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I. Randomised controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self‐monitoring by mobile phone applications offers new opportunities to engage patients in self‐management. Self‐monitoring has not been examined thoroughly as a self‐directed intervention strategy for self‐management of multiple behaviors and states by people living with HIV (PLH). METHODS: PLH (n = 50), primarily African American and Latino, were recruited from 2 AIDS services organizations and randomly assigned to daily smartphone (n = 34) or biweekly Web‐survey only (n = 16) self‐monitoring for 6 weeks. Smartphone self‐monitoring included responding to brief surveys on medication adherence, mental health, substance use, and sexual risk behaviors, and brief text diaries on stressful events. Qualitative analyses examine biweekly open‐ended user‐experience interviews regarding perceived benefits and barriers of self‐monitoring, and to elaborate a theoretical model for potential efficacy of self‐monitoring to support self‐management for multiple domains. RESULTS: Self‐monitoring functions include reflection for self‐awareness, cues to action (reminders), reinforcements from self‐tracking, and their potential effects on risk perceptions, motivations, skills, and behavioral activation states. Participants also reported therapeutic benefits related to self‐expression for catharsis, nonjudgmental disclosure, and in‐the‐moment support. About one‐third of participants reported that surveys were too long, frequent, or tedious. Some smartphone group participants suggested that daily self‐monitoring was more beneficial than biweekly due to frequency and in‐the‐moment availability. About twice as many daily self‐monitoring group participants reported increased awareness and behavior change support from self‐monitoring compared with biweekly Web‐survey only participants. CONCLUSIONS: Self‐monitoring is a potentially efficacious disruptive innovation for supporting self‐management by PLH and for complementing other interventions, but more research is needed to confirm efficacy, adoption, and sustainability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol use is prevalent in many societies and has major adverse impacts on health, but the availability of effective interventions limits treatment options for those who want assistance in changing their patterns of alcohol use. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the new Daybreak program, which is accessible via mobile app and desktop and was developed by Hello Sunday Morning to support high‐risk drinking individuals looking to change their relationship with alcohol. In particular, we compared the effect of adding online coaching via real‐time chat messages (intervention group) to an otherwise self‐guided program (control group). METHODS: We designed the intervention as a randomized control trial, but as some people (n=48; 11.9%) in the control group were able to use the online coaching, the main analysis comprised all participants. We collected online surveys at one‐month and three‐months follow‐up. The primary outcome was change in alcohol risk (measured with the alcohol use disorders identification test‐consumption [AUDIT‐C] score), but other outcomes included the number of standard drinks per week, alcohol‐related days out of role, psychological distress (Kessler‐10), and quality of life (EUROHIS‐QOL). Markers of engagement with the program included posts to the site and comments on the posts of others. The primary analysis used Weighted Generalized Estimating Equations. RESULTS: We recruited 398 people to the intervention group (50.2%) and 395 people to the control group (49.8%). Most were female (71%) and the mean age was 40.1 years. Most participants were classified as probably dependent (550, 69%) on the AUDIT‐10, with 243 (31%) classified with hazardous or harmful consumption. We followed up with 334 (42.1%) participants at one month and 293 (36.9%) at three months. By three months there were significant improvements in AUDIT‐C scores (down from mean 9.1 [SD 1.9] to 5.8 [SD 3.1]), alcohol consumed per week (down from mean 37.1 [SD 28.3] to mean 17.5 [SD 18.9]), days out of role (down from mean 1.6 [SD 3.6] to 0.5 [SD 1.6]), quality of life (up from 3.2 [SD 0.7] to 3.6 [SD 0.7]) and reduced distress (down from 24.8 [SD 7.0] to 19.0 [SD 6.6]). Accessing online coaching was not associated with improved outcomes, but engagement with the program (eg, posts and comments on the posts of others) were significantly associated with improvements (eg, in AUDIT‐C, alcohol use and EUROHIS‐QOL). Reduced alcohol use was found for both probably dependent (estimated marginal mean of 40.8 to 20.1 drinks) and hazardous or harmful alcohol users (estimated marginal mean of 22.9 to 11.9 drinks). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant reductions in alcohol use were found, as well as reduced alcohol risk (AUDIT‐C) and days out of role. Importantly, improved alcohol‐related outcomes were found for both hazardous or harmful and probably dependent drinkers. Since October 2016, Daybreak has reached more than 50,000 participants. Therefore, there is the potential for the program to have an impact on alcohol‐related problems at a population health level, importantly including an effect on probably dependent drinkers.

AB  - PURPOSE: Insured patients with cancer face high treatment‐related, out‐of‐pocket (OOP) costs and often cannot access financial assistance. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of Bridge, a patient‐facing app designed to identify eligible financial resources for patients. We hypothesized that patients using Bridge would experience greater OOP cost reduction than controls. METHODS: We enrolled patients with cancer who had OOP expenses from January 2018 to March 2019. We randomly assigned patients 1:1 to intervention (Bridge) versus control (financial assistance educational websites). Primary and secondary outcomes were self‐reported OOP costs and subjective financial distress 3 months postenrollment. In post hoc analyses, we analyzed application for and receipt of financial assistance at 3 months postenrollment. We used chi‐square, Mann‐Whitney tests, and logistic regression to compare study arms. RESULTS: We enrolled 200 patients. The median age was 57 years (IQR, 47.0‐63.0). Most patients had private insurance (71%), and the median household income was $62,000 in US dollars (USD) (IQR, $36,000‐$100,000 [USD]). Substantial missing data precluded assessment of primary and secondary outcomes. In post hoc analyses, patients in the Bridge arm were more likely than controls to both apply for and receive financial assistance. CONCLUSION: We were unable to test our primary outcome because of excessive missing follow‐up survey data. In exploratory post hoc analyses, patients who received a financial assistance app were more likely to apply for and receive financial assistance. Ultimately, our study highlights challenges faced in identifying measurable outcomes and retaining participants in a randomized, controlled trial of a mobile app to alleviate financial toxicity.

AB  - Background: Mogg and Bradley (2016) proposed that attentional bias (to threat stimuli) among patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may be associated with the top‐down attention control process. Additionally, some scholars (e.g., Enock & McNally, 2013) have designed mobile applications to enable patients to engage in home‐delivered attentional bias modification (HD‐ABM); however, many problems related to these training systems have not yet been addressed. Method: A total of 82 participants (61 women, mean age = 21.47 y) who received GAD diagnoses were randomly assigned to an HD‐ABM (n = 30), placebo training (n = 30), or waiting list (n = 22) group. Both the HD‐ABM and placebo groups were trained with the attention training application (through Android phones three times a day for four weeks). Results: (1) All measures of participants’ self‐reported symptoms (except for trait anxiety) were significantly lower in Week 4 and in the follow‐up. (2) Attentional network test (ANT) results demonstrated that all participants’ alerting scores significantly increased by Week 4. (3) Participants in the HD‐ABM and placebo groups demonstrated significant increases in their self‐reported attention control scores, decreases in their attention bias index (ABI) scores, and progress in their executive control abilities. Limitations: Self‐report scales may have been insufficient for measuring effectiveness in the present study. Conclusions: This study helps to elucidate the mechanism underlying changes in attention processes after HD‐ABM training implemented through a mobile application in GAD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum depression is a common health problem for women following childbirth. Using effective social support to reduce postpartum depression has become an important issue. The current popularity of smartphones offers new possibilities for interventional methods. PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of mobile‐application‐based social support programs on perceived stress and postpartum depression in postpartum women. METHODS: The present study employs an experimental research design. 126 smartphone users at 36 weeks' gestation were assigned randomly to the intervention (n = 61) or the control (n = 65) group. The intervention group received a social‐support intervention via the mobile application Line twice per week for a period of 4 weeks after childbirth. The control group did not receive the intervention. The Perceived Stress Scale‐Chinese version and Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale were used to evaluate the outcome. RESULTS: Participants in the intervention group had significantly lower perceived stress (F = 27.25, p < .001) and postpartum depression (F = 35.73, p < .001) than their control group peers. CONCLUSIONS: Social‐support programs that are delivered via mobile applications such as Line may significantly reduce the perceived stress and postpartum depression of women during the early postpartum period. The results support the implementation of mobile‐application‐based social support programs in postpartum care.

AB  - Introduction: Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that needs consistent exercise and an accurate understanding of the condition for long‐term maintenance. While the accessibility of outpatient care is essential for disease management, many patients lack the resources to receive adequate healthcare. To address this challenge, we developed a not‐for‐profit interactive mobile application that provides a disease‐specific educational background and a structured exercise regimen to patients. Material and methods: ?Rak Kao? (English translation: Love‐Your‐Knee) mobile application was designed to analyze the questionnaire data to assess the stage of knee OA and generate a personalized recommendation of treatment and exercise type using rule‐based and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. A single‐blinded study was conducted with patients (n = 82) who were randomly assigned to the mobile application group (M‐group) and the handout group (H‐group). Patient groups were controlled for age, gender, BMI, onset of pain, grade of disease, education level, and occupation. Accuracy in performance of three prescribed knee exercises (catch‐bend‐down, stretch‐touch‐feet, and sit‐stretch‐hold) was evaluated. Clinical outcomes were evaluated before and after the 4‐weeks program to assess the range of motion, symptoms, pain, physical activity, and quality of life via the KOOS and KSS scores. Results: Completion of the study led to significantly more overall exercise accuracy in the M‐group (76.2%) than the H‐group (52.5%). Activities of daily life, quality of life, ability to do sports and recreational activities were significantly more improved in the M‐group than the H‐group (p <.01). No difference in the range of motion between groups. Satisfaction of patients? experience was higher in the M‐group than the H‐group (p =.001) after the 4‐week regimen. Conclusions: With the better accuracy and outcomes for rehabilitation in the M‐group than the H‐group, we strongly recommend using our mobile application as a better alternative than handouts for exercises and information for patients with knee OA.

AB  - Homeless young adults are more likely than their never‐homeless counterparts to abuse substances and engage in sexual risk behaviors. This study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of OnTrack, a smartphone application to self‐monitor substance use and sexual risk behaviors, plus a brief motivational intervention (BMI), in reducing substance use and sexual risk among homeless young adults. A randomized controlled pilot trial (N = 60) compared OnTrack + BMI to treatment as usual (TAU) at an inner‐city crisis shelter for homeless young adults (aged 18‐21 years). Participants were assessed at baseline and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after baseline to evaluate substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Kruskal‐Wallis tests determined differences between baseline and postintervention assessments. Logistic regression models examined treatment effect on change in outcomes between baseline and postintervention follow‐up assessment, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in OnTrack + BMI significantly reduced past 2‐week number of drinks (p = .023), times used marijuana (p = .046), times engaged in unprotected sex (p = .012), and times used drugs before sexual activity (p = .019). No reductions of substance use or sexual risk behaviors were found among participants in TAU (all ps > .05). After adjusting for baseline levels of substance use and sexual risk, participants in OnTrack + BMI had significantly lower odds than those in TAU for drinking alcohol (adjusted OR = 0.14; p = .01) and having unprotected sex (adjusted OR = 0.151; p = .032). OnTrack + BMI is feasible and effective in reducing past 2‐week alcohol use and unprotected sex among homeless young adults. A larger randomized trial is warranted to replicate and extend present results. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - Objectives: This study evaluated the immediate effects and acceptability of a smartphone application named NeckProtector to promote neck pain self-management through stretching incorporating deep slow breathing, among smartphone users with neck pain. Methods: One-hundred participants were recruited in the study. Participants were divided into two groups by block randomized allocation. The researchers gave the NeckProtector application to all participants for acceptability testing by navigation of the application for 20-30 minutes. Next, the treatment group (n = 50) conducted the exercise program via smartphone application for 15-20 minutes, while the control group (n = 50) rested for 20 minutes. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after intervention for pain intensity, muscle tension, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and cervical range of motion (CROM). Quantitative and qualitative feedback was then obtained by an acceptability survey and open-ended questionnaires. Results: The immediate effects showed statistically significant improvements in pain intensity, muscle tension, PPT, and CROM in the treatment group in comparison to the control group. Participants reported a high level of acceptability through ratings on a Likert scale. The qualitative questionnaires received positive responses that the application was easy to use and the exercise program was useful to cope with neck pain. Conclusions: NeckProtector can be an alternative treatment for neck pain self-management via smartphone application among smartphone users with neck pain. Further studies should examine the long-term effectiveness (Clinical trials registry: TCTR20160523001).

AB  - Background: Smartphones present a near‐ubiquitous channel through which structured lifestyle change can reduce risk or progression of the most common noncommunicable diseases. We explored whether a digital structured lifestyle program enhances weight loss. Methods: We randomized overweight and obese participants attending a four‐month lifestyle change program to either standard weekly coaching sessions (controls), or standard treatment supplemented with a digital therapeutic mobile application (intervention). Changes in body mass index after four months were the main outcome measure. Odds ratios of achieving 5% weight loss were estimated with unconditional logistic regression. Results: Of 234 eligible persons, 146 (62%) agreed to participate, were block‐randomized, showed up for the baseline measures, and constituted the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) sample (n = 95 intervention group, n = 51 control group). In the intervention group, 70 (74%) downloaded the mobile application and completed the program (intervention per‐protocol). Significant weight loss and BMI reduction were observed for both the intention‐to‐treat intervention group (P < 0.05, P = 0.01) and the per‐protocol intervention group (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001). For the intervention per‐protocol group, the odds ratio of achieving 5% weight loss, compared to not treated per‐protocol, was 3.3 (95% CI 1.3‐8.2), adjusting for age and weight at baseline.Attendance to weekly coaching sessions decreased by 18% during the program in the control group while it increased by 3% amongst the per‐protocol group (P = 0.004). Conclusions: These preliminary findings support the benefit of a digital therapeutic to enhance weight reduction and attendance in a structured lifestyle change program. Larger trials of longer duration are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is a common condition with a significant physical, psychosocial, and economic impact. Due to enormous progress in mobile device technology as well as the increase in smartphone ownership in the general population, mobile apps can be used to monitor patients with pain and support them in pain management. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of smartphone or computer tablet apps in the management of patients with pain. METHODS: In December 2017, a literature search was performed in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and PsycINFO. In addition, a bibliography search was conducted. We included studies with at least 20 participants per arm that evaluated the effects of apps on smartphones or computer tablets on improvement in pain. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies with 1962 patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 studies examined the effect of mobile apps on pain management in an in-clinic setting and 11 in an out-clinic setting. The majority of the original studies reported beneficial effects of the use of a pain app. Severity of pain decreased in most studies where patients were using an app compared with patients not using an app. Other outcomes, such as worst pain or quality of life showed improvements in patients using an app. Due to heterogeneity between the original studies-patient characteristics, app content, and study setting-a synthesis of the results by statistical methods was not performed. CONCLUSIONS: Apps for pain management may be beneficial for patients, particularly in an out-clinic setting. Studies have shown that pain apps are workable and well liked by patients and health care professionals. There is no doubt that in the near future, mobile technologies will develop further. Medicine could profit from this development as indicated by our results, but there is a need for more scientific inputs. It is desirable to know which elements of apps or additional devices and tools may improve usability and help patients in pain management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modern health care focuses on shared decision making (SDM) because of its positive effects on patient satisfaction, therapy compliance, and outcomes. Patients' knowledge about their illness and available treatment options, gained through medical education, is one of the key drivers for SDM. Current patient education relies heavily on medical consultation and is known to be ineffective. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether providing patients with information in a subdivided, categorized, and interactive manner via an educational app for smartphone or tablet might increase the knowledge of their illness. METHODS: A surgeon-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted with 213 patients who were referred to 1 of the 6 Dutch hospitals by their general practitioner owing to knee complaints that were indicative of knee osteoarthritis. An interactive app that, in addition to standard care, actively sends informative and pertinent content to patients about their illness on a daily basis by means of push notifications in the week before their consultation. The primary outcome was the level of perceived and actual knowledge that patients had about their knee complaints and the relevant treatment options after the intervention. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were enrolled in the control group and 91 in the intervention group. After the intervention, the level of actual knowledge (measured on a 0-36 scale) was 52% higher in the app group (26.4 vs 17.4, P<.001). Moreover, within the app group, the level of perceived knowledge (measured on a 0-25 scale) increased by 22% during the week within the app group (from 13.5 to 16.5, P<.001), compared with no gain in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Actively offering patients information in a subdivided (per day), categorized (per theme), and interactive (video and quiz questions) manner significantly increases the level of perceived knowledge and demonstrates a higher level of actual knowledge, compared with standard care educational practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients who undergo primary Total Knee Replacement surgery (TKR) are often discharged within 1‐3 days after surgery. With this relatively short length of hospital stay, a patient's self‐management is a crucial factor in optimizing the outcome of their treatment. In the case of TKR, self‐management primarily involves adequate pain management, followed by physiotherapy exercises and daily self‐care activities. Patients are educated on all these topics by hospital staff upon discharge from the hospital but often struggle to comprehend this information due to its quantity, complexity, and the passive mode of communication used to convey it. OBJECTIVE: This study primarily aims to determine whether actively educating TKR patients with timely, day‐to‐day postoperative care information through an app could lead to a decrease in their level of pain compared to those who only receive standard information about their recovery through the app. In addition, physical functioning, quality of life, ability to perform physiotherapy exercises and daily self‐care activities, satisfaction with information, perceived involvement by the hospital, and health care consumption were also assessed. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed in five Dutch hospitals. In total, 213 patients who had undergone elective, primary, unilateral TKR participated. All patients had access to an app for their smartphone and tablet to guide them after discharge. The intervention group could unlock day‐to‐day information by entering a personal code. The control group only received weekly, basic information. Primary (level of pain) and secondary outcomes (physical functioning, quality of life, ability to perform physiotherapy exercises and activities of daily self‐care, satisfaction with information, perceived involvement by the hospital, and health care consumption) were measured using self‐reported online questionnaires. All outcomes were measured weekly in the four weeks after discharge, except for physical functioning and quality of life, which were measured at baseline and at four weeks after discharge. Data was analyzed using Student t tests, chi‐square tests, and linear mixed models for repeated measures. RESULTS: In total, 114 patients were enrolled in the intervention group (IG) and 99 in the control group (CG). Four weeks after discharge, patients in the IG performed significantly better than patients in the CG on all dimensions of pain: pain at rest (mean 3.45 vs mean 4.59; P=.001), pain during activity (mean 3.99 vs mean 5.08; P<.001) and pain at night (mean 4.18 vs mean 5.21; P=.003). Additionally, significant differences were demonstrated in favor of the intervention group for all secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the four weeks following TKR, the active and day‐to‐day education of patients via the app significantly decreased their level of pain and improved their physical functioning, quality of life, ability to perform physiotherapy exercises and activities of daily self‐care, satisfaction with information, perceived involvement by the hospital, and health care consumption compared to standard patient education. Given the rising number of TKR patients and the increased emphasis on self‐management, we suggest using an app with timely postoperative care education as a standard part of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient education is a crucial element within health care. It is a known predictor for increased engagement in shared decision making, improved medication and treatment adherence, higher levels of satisfaction, and even better treatment outcomes. Unfortunately, often patients only remember a very limited amount of medical information. An important reason is that most patients are simply not capable of processing large amounts of new medical information in a short time. Apps for smartphones and tablets have the potential to actively educate patients by providing them with timely information through the use of push notifications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the effects of using smartphone and tablet apps to educate patients with timely education. Within this review, we focused on patients that receive their care in a hospital setting. We assessed the effects of the interventions on outcomes, such as patients' knowledge about their illness and treatment, adherence to treatment instructions and to medication usage, and satisfaction with the care they received. METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Web of Science was conducted. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2015 and November 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently searched and screened articles, assessed study quality and risk of bias, and extracted the data. Due to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and outcomes, a meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate. Instead, a narrative synthesis is presented. RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs with 4106 participants were included. Compared to usual care, overall effectiveness of the interventions was demonstrated in 69% of the outcomes. Effectiveness increased to 82% when the intervention had a duration shorter than one month and increased to 78% when the intervention provided at least one push notification per week. The interventions showed the highest effects on satisfaction with information, adherence to treatment instructions and to medication usage, clinical outcomes, and knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates that educating patients with timely medical information through their smartphones or tablets improves their levels of knowledge, medication or treatment adherence, satisfaction, and clinical outcomes, as well as having a positive effect on health care economics. These effects are most pronounced in interventions with a short duration (ie, less than a month) and with a high frequency of messages to patients (ie, once per week or more). With the knowledge that patient education is a predictor for improved outcomes and the fact that patients have obvious difficulties processing large amounts of new medical information, we suggest incorporating the delivery of timely information through smartphone and tablet apps within current medical practices.

AB  - Non‐specific low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of global disability. Multidisciplinary pain treatment (MPT) programs comprising educational, physical, and psychological interventions have shown positive treatment effects on LBP. Nonetheless, such programs are costly and treatment opportunities are often limited to specialized medical centers. mHealth and other digital interventions may be a promising method to successfully support patient self‐management in LBP. To address these issues, we investigated the clinical effects of a multidisciplinary mHealth back pain App (Kaia App) in a randomized controlled trial (registered at German Clinical Trials Register under DRKS00016329). One‐hundred one adult patients with non‐specific LBP from 6 weeks to 1 year were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group. In the intervention group, the Kaia App was provided for 3 months. Control treatment consisted of six individual physiotherapy sessions over 6 weeks and high‐quality online education. The primary outcome, pain intensity, was assessed at 12‐week follow‐up on an 11‐point numeric rating scale (NRS). Our per‐protocol analysis showed no significant differences between the groups at baseline (Kaia App group: M = 5.10 (SD = 1.07) vs. control group: M = 5.41 (SD = 1.15). At 12‐week follow‐up the Kaia App group reported significantly lower pain intensity (M = 2.70 (SD = 1.51)) compared to the control group (M = 3.40 (SD = 1.63)). Our results indicate that the Kaia App as a multidisciplinary back pain app is an effective treatment in LBP patients and is superior to physiotherapy in combination with online education.

AB  - Given that the one-size-fits-all approach to mobile health interventions have limited effects, a personalized approach might be necessary to promote healthy behaviors and prevent chronic conditions. Our systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of personalized mobile interventions on lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption), and identify the effective key features of such interventions. We included any experimental trials that tested a personalized mobile app or fitness tracker and reported any lifestyle behavior measures. We conducted a narrative synthesis for all studies, and a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Thirty-nine articles describing 31 interventions were included (n = 77,243, 64% women). All interventions personalized content and rarely personalized other features. Source of data included system-captured (12 interventions), user-reported (11 interventions) or both (8 interventions). The meta-analysis showed a moderate positive effect on lifestyle behavior outcomes (standardized difference in means [SDM] 0.663, 95% CI 0.228 to 1.10). A meta-regression model including source of data found that interventions that used system-captured data for personalization were associated with higher effectiveness than those that used user-reported data (SDM 1.48, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.19). In summary, the field is in its infancy, with preliminary evidence of the potential efficacy of personalization in improving lifestyle behaviors. Source of data for personalization might be important in determining intervention effectiveness. To fully exploit the potential of personalization, future high-quality studies should investigate the integration of multiple data from different sources and include personalized features other than content.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-management support for people with type 2 diabetes is essential in diabetes care. Thus, mobile health technology with or without low-intensity theory-based health counseling could become an important tool for promoting self-management. OBJECTIVES: The aim was to evaluate whether the introduction of technology-supported self-management using the Few Touch Application (FTA) diabetes diary with or without health counseling improved glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, self-management, behavioral change, and health-related quality of life, and to describe the sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle characteristics of the participants after 4 months. METHODS: A 3-armed randomized controlled trial was conducted in Norway during 2011-2013. In the 2 intervention groups, participants were given a mobile phone for 1 year, which provided access to the FTA diary, a self-help tool that recorded 5 elements: blood glucose, food habits, physical activity, personal goal setting, and a look-up system for diabetes information. One of the intervention groups was also offered theory-based health counseling with a specialist diabetes nurse by telephone for 4 months from baseline. Both intervention groups and the control group were provided usual care according to the national guidelines. Adults with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c >=7.1% were included (N=151). There were 3 assessment points: baseline, 4 months, and 1 year. We report the short-term findings after 4 months. HbA1c was the primary outcome and the secondary outcomes were self-management (Health Education Impact Questionnaire, heiQ), behavioral change (diet and physical activity), and health-related quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire). The data were analyzed using univariate methods (ANOVA), multivariate linear, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Data were analyzed from 124 individuals (attrition rate was 18%). The groups were well balanced at baseline. There were no differences in HbA1c between groups after 4 months, but there was a decline in all groups. There were changes in self-management measured using the health service navigation item in the heiQ, with improvements in the FTA group compared to the control group (P=.01) and in the FTA with health counseling group compared with both other groups (P=.04). This may indicate an improvement in the ability of patients to communicate health needs to their health care providers. Furthermore, the FTA group reported higher scores for skill and technique acquisition at relieving symptoms compared to the control group (P=.02). There were no significant changes in any of the domains of the SF-36. CONCLUSIONS: The primary outcome, HbA1c, did not differ between groups after 4 months. Both of the intervention groups had significantly better scores than the control group for health service navigation and the FTA group also exhibited improved skill and technique acquisition.

AB  - Context: Failure to adhere to drug therapy in patients with high blood pressure can endanger their lives.
Aims: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of smartphone-based medication reminder application on medication adherence of patients with essential hypertension.
Settings and Design: This clinical trial study was conducted in Yazd Cardiac Research Center.
Material and Methods: Seventy-eight patients with essential hypertension were assigned to intervention (39 patients) and control (39 patients) groups using a random sampling method. In the intervention group, the DaroYab 2.1.0 was installed on the patient's smartphone. The control group received routine care. Data were collected using demographic characteristics form and Morriskey's medication adherence scale (MMAS-8). The MMAS-8 completed prior to and 3 months after the intervention.
Statistical Analysis Used: Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS, American multinational technology company, Armonk, New York and nonparametric tests including the Wilcoxon test and Mann–Whitney U-test.
Results: The mean age of the 78 patients who completed the study was 46.6 ± 7.98 years. All of the participants had a history of drug forgetfulness and 92.5% of them had poor medication adherence before the intervention. Three months after the intervention, the ratio of good medication adherence and medication adherence scores was significantly improved in the DaroYab software group (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Considering the positive impact of DaroYab as a simple, practical, and inexpensive drug reminder, on medication adherence it is recommended that health-care providers introduce this application to of hypertensive patients and encourage them to use it.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital interventions that deliver psychological self-help provide the opportunity to reach individuals at risk of suicide who do not access traditional health services. Our primary objective was to test whether direct (targeting suicidality) and indirect (targeting depression) digital interventions are effective in reducing suicidal ideation and behaviours, and our secondary analyses assessed whether direct interventions were more effective than indirect interventions. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched online databases MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials published between database inception to May 21, 2019. Superiority randomised controlled trials of self-guided digital interventions (app or web based, which delivered theory-based therapeutic content) were included if they reported suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, or suicide attempts as an outcome. Non-inferiority randomised controlled trials were excluded to ensure comparability of the effect. Data were extracted from published reports, and intention-to-treat data were used if available. The primary outcome was the difference in mean scores of validated suicidal ideation measures (Hedges'g) with the associated 95% CI for the analysis of digital intervention effectiveness on suicidal ideation. We also present funnel plots of the primary outcome measure (suicidal ideation) for direct and indirect interventions to assess for publication bias. We calculated I<sup>2</sup> (with I<sup>2</sup> CI) values to test heterogeneity. We used random-effects modelling for the meta-analyses to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018102084. FINDINGS: The literature search yielded 739 articles (including manual searching) for suicidality and 8842 articles for depression. After screening, 14 papers reporting on 16 studies were included in the narrative review and meta-analysis. The 16 studies (ten on direct interventions and six on indirect interventions) provided baseline data for 4398 participants. The primary outcome of overall post-intervention effect for suicidal ideation was small but significant immediately following the active intervention phase (Hedges'g -0.18, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.10, p<0.0001; I<sup>2</sup>=0%, I<sup>2</sup> CI 0.0-47.9). The secondary objective, comparing direct and indirect interventions, showed that direct interventions (targeting suicidality) significantly reduced suicidal ideation at post-intervention (g -0.23, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.11, p<0.0001; I<sup>2</sup>=17.6%, I<sup>2</sup> CI 0.0-58.6), but indirect interventions (targeting depression) failed to reach significance (g -0.12, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.01, p=0.071; I<sup>2</sup>=0%, I<sup>2</sup> CI 0.0-30.7). INTERPRETATION: Self-guided digital interventions directly targeting suicidal ideation are effective immediately post-intervention. Indirect interventions were not significant for reducing suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest that digital interventions should be promoted and disseminated widely, especially where there is a lack of, or minimal access to, health services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) diabetes prevention program (DPP) has formed the foundation for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) prevention efforts and lifestyle change modifications in multiple care settings. To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has verified the efficacy of a fully mobile version of CDC's diabetes prevention program (DPP). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the long-term weight loss and glycemic efficacy of a mobile-delivered DPP compared with a control group receiving usual medical care. METHODS: Adults with prediabetes (N=202) were recruited from a clinic and randomized to either a mobile-delivered, coach-guided DPP (Noom) or a control group that received regular medical care including a paper-based DPP curriculum and no formal intervention. The intervention group learned how to use the Noom program, how to interact with their coach, and the importance of maintaining motivation. They had access to an interactive coach-to-participant interface and group messaging, daily challenges for behavior change, DPP-based education articles, food logging, and automated feedback. Primary outcomes included changes in weight and hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) levels at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Exploratory secondary outcomes included program engagement as a predictor of changes in weight and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. RESULTS: A total of 202 participants were recruited and randomized into the intervention (n=101) or control group (n=99). In the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, changes in the participants' weight and BMI were significantly different at 6 months between the intervention and control groups, but there was no difference in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (mean difference 0.004%, SE 0.05; P=.94). Weight and BMI were lower in the intervention group by -2.64 kg (SE 0.71; P<.001) and -0.99 kg/m2 (SE 0.29; P=.001), respectively. These differences persisted at 12 months. However, in the analyses that did not involve ITT, program completers achieved a significant weight loss of 5.6% (SE 0.81; P<.001) at 6 months, maintaining 4.7% (SE 0.88; P<.001) of their weight loss at 12 months. The control group lost -0.15% at 6 months (SE 0.64; P=.85) and gained 0.33% (SE 0.70; P=.63) at 12 months. Those randomized to the intervention group who did not start the program had no meaningful weight or HbA<sub>1c</sub> level change, similar to the control group. At 1 year, the intervention group showed a 0.23% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels; those who completed the intervention showed a 0.28% reduction. Those assigned to the control group had a 0.16% reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels. CONCLUSIONS: This novel mobile-delivered DPP achieved significant weight loss reductions for up to 1 year compared with usual care. This type of intervention reduces the risk of overt diabetes without the added barriers of in-person interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eating disorders severely impact psychological, physical, and social functioning, and yet, the majority of individuals with eating disorders do not receive treatment. Mobile health apps have the potential to decrease access barriers to care and reach individuals who have been underserved by traditional treatment modalities. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored, fully automated self-help version of Recovery Record, an app developed for eating disorders management. We examined differences in eating disorder symptom change in app users that were randomized to receive either a standard, cognitive behavioral therapy-based version of the app or a tailored version that included algorithmically determined clinical content aligned with baseline and evolving user eating disorder symptom profiles. METHODS: Participants were people with eating disorder symptoms who did not have access to traditional treatment options and were recruited via the open-access Recovery Record app to participate in this randomized controlled trial. We examined both continuous and categorical clinical improvement outcomes (measured with the self-report Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire [EDE-Q]) in both intervention groups. RESULTS: Between December 2016 and August 2018, 3294 Recovery Record app users were recruited into the study, out of which 959 were considered engaged, completed follow-up assessments, and were included in the analyses. Both study groups achieved significant overall outcome improvement, with 61.6% (180/292) of the tailored group and 55.4% (158/285) of the standard group achieving a clinically meaningful change in the EDE-Q, on average. There were no statistically significant differences between randomized groups for continuous outcomes, but a pattern of improvement being greater in the tailored group was evident. The rate of remission on the EDE-Q at 8 weeks was significantly greater in the group receiving the tailored version (d=0.22; P<=.001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to compare the relative efficacy of two versions of a mobile app for eating disorders. The data suggest that underserved individuals with eating disorder symptoms may benefit clinically from a self-help app and that personalizing app content to specific clinical presentations may be more effective in promoting symptomatic remission on the EDE-Q than content that offers a generic approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our objectives were to assess: 1) the effectiveness of existing mHealth apps for reducing symptoms of maternal depression and/or anxiety during the prenatal period and/or the first year postpartum, and 2) the app quality of commercially available apps targeting perinatal depression and/or anxiety. METHODS: To address Objective 1, we searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Embase) from their inception until May 3rd, 2021. For the second objective, we searched Google Play and Apple App Stores in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia until May 3rd, 2021. RESULTS: Our search identified 3,897 articles, seven of which were meta-analyzed. mHealth apps did not improve perinatal depression (SMD, -0.39; 95% CI, -0.80 to 0.03) or anxiety (SMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.16) within the first 3 months post-intervention or at 6 months post-intervention. Our search of app stores identified 74 commercially available apps, 37 of which were evaluated via MARS tool. Current apps for perinatal anxiety and/or depression were rated to be of moderate quality on the MARS (mean, 3.6/5). LIMITATIONS: There is a small number of overall studies in this field and the individual studies have methodological limitations. Furthermore, few apps identified in our app store search have been clinically tested. CONCLUSION: Despite their widespread availability, mHealth apps do not appear to effectively reduce perinatal depression or anxiety, and few were subjectively rated to be of high quality. There is a need to develop higher quality mHealth apps and assess their potential to improve perinatal maternal mental health.

AB  - Background: Improving adherence to direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) is challenging, and simple text messaging reminders have not been effective. Methods: SmartADHERE was a randomized trial that tested a personalized digital and human direct oral anticoagulant adherence intervention compared to usual care. Eligibility required age ≥ 18, newly‐prescribed (≤90 days) rivaroxaban for atrial fibrillation (AF), 1 of 4 at‐risk criteria for nonadherence, and a smartphone. The intervention consisted of combination of a medication management smartphone app, daily app‐based reminders, adaptive text messaging, and phone‐based counseling for severe nonadherence. The primary outcome was the proportion of days covered by rivaroxaban (PDC) at 6 months. There were 25 U.S. sites, all cardiology and electrophysiology outpatient practices, activated for a target sample size of 378, but the study was terminated by the sponsor prior to reaching target enrollment. Results: There were 139 participants (age 65±9.6 years, 30% female, median CHA2DS2‐VASc score 3 with IQR 2 to 4, mean total medication burden 7.7±4.4). DOAC adherence was high in both arms with no difference in the primary outcome (PDC 0.86±0.25 intervention vs 0.88±0.25 control, p=0.62) or in secondary outcomes including PDC ≥ 0.80 and medication persistence. Per protocol analyses had similar results. Because of the high overall PDC, the likelihood to answer the primary hypothesis was only 51% even if target enrollment were achieved. There were no study‐related adverse events. Conclusions: The use of a centralized digital and human adherence intervention was feasible across multiple sites. Overall adherence was much higher than expected despite prescreening for at‐risk individuals. SmartADHERE illustrates the challenges of trials of behavioral and technology interventions, where enrollment itself may lead to selection bias or treatment effects. Pragmatic study designs, such as cluster randomization or stepped‐wedge implementation, should be considered to improve enrollment and generalizability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a post hoc analysis of a 6‐month randomized weight loss trial among 96 overweight men and women (body mass index (BMI) 25‐45 kg/m(2)) conducted from 2010 to 2011. Participants in both randomized groups were collapsed and categorized by their chosen self‐monitoring method for diet and PA. All participants received a behavioral weight loss intervention delivered via podcast and were encouraged to self‐monitor dietary intake and PA. RESULTS: Adjusting for randomized group and demographics, PA app users self‐monitored exercise more frequently over the 6‐month study (2.6±0.5 days/week) and reported greater intentional PA (196.4±45.9 kcal/day) than non‐app users (1.2±0.5 days/week PA self‐monitoring, p<0.01; 100.9±45.1 kcal/day intentional PA, p=0.02). PA app users also had a significantly lower BMI at 6 months (31.5±0.5 kg/m(2)) than non‐users (32.5±0.5 kg/m(2); p=0.02). Frequency of self‐monitoring did not differ by diet self‐monitoring method (p=0.63); however, app users consumed less energy (1437±188 kcal/day) than paper journal users (2049±175 kcal/day; p=0.01) at 6 months. BMI did not differ among the three diet monitoring methods (p=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to potential benefits of mobile monitoring methods during behavioral weight loss trials. Future studies should examine ways to predict which self‐monitoring method works best for an individual to increase adherence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of two different mobile dietary self‐monitoring methods for weight loss. METHODS: Adults with overweight (n = 81; mean BMI 34.7 ± 5.6 kg/m2 ) were randomized to self‐monitor their diet with a mobile app (App, n = 42) or wearable Bite Counter device (Bite, n = 39). Both groups received the same behavioral weight loss information via twice‐weekly podcasts. Weight, physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), and energy intake (two dietary recalls) were assessed at 0, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: At 6 months, 75% of participants completed the trial. The App group lost significantly more weight (‐6.8 ± 0.8 kg) than the Bite group (‐3.0 ± 0.8 kg; group × time interaction: P < 0.001). Changes in energy intake (kcal/d) (‐621 ± 157 App, ‐456 ± 167 Bite; P = 0.47) or number of days diet was tracked (90.7 ± 9.1 App, 68.4 ± 9.8 Bite; P = 0.09) did not differ between groups, but the Bite group had significant increases in physical activity metabolic equivalents (+2015.4 ± 684.6 min/wk; P = 0.02) compared to little change in the App group (‐136.5 ± 630.6; P = 0.02). Total weight loss was significantly correlated with number of podcasts downloaded (r = ‐0.33, P < 0.01) and number of days diet was tracked (r = ‐0.33, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: While frequency of diet tracking was similar between the App and Bite groups, there was greater weight loss observed in the App group.

AB  - Self-efficacy (SE) and information processing (IP) may be important constructs to target when designing mHealth interventions for weight loss. The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between SE and IP with weight loss at six-months as part of the Dietary Interventions Examining Tracking with mobile study, a six-month randomized trial with content delivered remotely via twice-weekly podcasts. Participants were randomized to self-monitor their diet with either a mobile app (n = 42) or wearable Bite Counter device (n = 39). SE was assessed using the Weight Efficacy Life-Style Questionnaire and the IP variables assessed included user control, cognitive load, novelty, elaboration. Regression analysis examined the relationship between weight loss, SE change & IP at six months. Results indicate that elaboration was the strongest predictor of weight loss (s =-0.423, P = 0.011) among all SE & IP variables and that for every point increase in elaboration, participants lost 0.34 kg body weight.

AB  - Objectives: In Denmark, patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) have completed patient‐reported outcome measures (PROMs) via touchscreens in the outpatient clinic since 2006. However, current technology makes it possible for patients to use their own smartphone via an application (app) developed for the Danish Rheumatology Database (DANBIO). This study aims to evaluate the agreement of PROMs between the DANBIO app and outpatient touchscreen in patients with IA. Method: Patients with IA (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondyloarthritis) were enrolled in a randomized, crossover, agreement study. Participants answered PROMs through the two device types in a randomized order. Differences in PROM scores with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated for similarity according to prespecified equivalence margins. Results: The touchscreen invitation was accepted by 138 patients. Sixty patients (20 with each diagnosis) were included. The difference in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index between the two device types was −0.007 (95% CI −0.043 to 0.030); thus, equivalence was demonstrated. In addition, all other PROMs obtained with the two device types were equivalent, except for the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), which was within the limits of minimally clinically important difference (MCID). In total, 78.3% preferred the DANBIO app. Conclusion: In patients with IA, equivalence was demonstrated between two device types for all PROMs except BASDAI; however, BASDAI was within the limits of the MCID. Implementation of the DANBIO app is expected to optimize outpatient visits, thereby improving healthcare for the individual patient and society.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the feasibility and usability of electronic momentary assessment, goal‐setting and personalized phone‐calls on adherence to a 12‐week self‐conducted interval walking training (IWT) program, delivered by the InterWalk smartphone among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: In a two‐arm pilot randomized controlled trial (Denmark, March 2014 to February 2015), patients with T2D (18‐80 years with a Body Mass Index of 18 and 40 kg/m2) were randomly allocated to 12 weeks of IWT with (experimental) or without additional support (control). The primary outcome was the difference between groups in accumulated time of interval walking training across 12 weeks. All patients were encouraged to use the InterWalk application to perform IWT for ≥90 minute/week. Patients in the experimental group made individual goals regarding lifestyle change. Once a week inquiries about exercise adherence was made using an ecological momentary assessment (EMA). In case of consistent self‐reported non‐adherence, the patients would receive a phone‐call inquiring about the reason for non‐adherence. The control group did not receive additional support. Information about training adherence was assessed objectively. Usability of the EMA was assessed based on response rates and self‐reported satisfaction after 12‐weeks. RESULTS: Thirty‐seven patients with T2D (66 years, 65% female, hemoglobin 1Ac 50.3 mmol/mol) where included (n = 18 and n = 19 in experimental and control group, respectively). The retention rate was 83%. The experimental group accumulated [95%CI] 345 [‐7, 698] minutes of IWT more than the control group. The response rate for the text‐messages was 83% (68% for males and 90% for females). Forty‐one percent of the experimental and 25% of the control group were very satisfied with their participation. CONCLUSION: The combination inquiry about adherence using EMA, goal‐setting with the possibility of follow‐up phone calls are considered feasible interventions to attain training adherence when using the InterWalk app during a 12‐week period in patients with T2D. Some uncertainty about the effect size of adherence remains. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02089477.

AB  - Increasing the saliency of existing sources of meaning and purpose in life could be a practicalfocus area for innovative wellbeing interventions. This randomised controlled study aimed to assess the impact of a brief seven-day technology-based intervention on meaning in life, life satisfaction, and affect compared to a waitlist control group. A mobile phone application was used to deliver daily activities and momentary reflection questions. Significant improvements where observed in the presence of meaning in life (p = .02, eta2 = .05), life satisfaction (p = .00, eta2 = .08) and positive affect (p = .02, eta2 = 0.05) for the intervention versus the control group. Ecological momentary assessment data found increases in life satisfaction and meaning in life (b = 0.044, p = .041) and shed insight into activities that fostered fulfillment. These findings pave the way for future meaning and purpose interventions to build mental health and well-being. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: ImpulsePal is a theory-driven (dual-process), evidence-informed, and person-centered smartphone app intervention designed to help people manage impulsive processes that prompt unhealthy eating to facilitate dietary change and weight loss. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (1) assess the feasibility of trial procedures for evaluation of the ImpulsePal intervention, (2) estimate standard deviations of outcomes, and (3) assess usability of, and satisfaction with, ImpulsePal. METHODS: We conducted an individually randomized parallel two-arm nonblinded feasibility trial. The eligibility criteria included being aged >=16 years, having a body mass index of >=25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and having access to an Android-based device. Weight was measured (as the proposed primary outcome for a full-scale trial) at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months of follow-up. Participants were randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to the ImpulsePal intervention or a waiting list control group. A nested action-research study allowed for data-driven refinement of the intervention across 2 cycles of feedback. RESULTS: We screened 179 participants for eligibility, and 58 were randomized to the intervention group and 30 to the control group. Data were available for 74 (84%, 74/88) participants at 1 month and 67 (76%, 67/88) participants at 3 months. The intervention group (n=43) lost 1.03 kg (95% CI 0.33 to 1.74) more than controls (n=26) at 1 month and 1.01 kg (95% CI -0.45 to 2.47) more than controls (n=43 and n=24, respectively) at 3 months. Feedback suggested changes to intervention design were required to (1) improve receipt and understanding of instructions and (2) facilitate further engagement with the app and its strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation methods and delivery of the ImpulsePal app intervention are feasible, and the trial procedures, measures, and intervention are acceptable and satisfactory to the participants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Improving adherence to preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by providing automated feedback on self‐reported PrEP use via a mobile application (app). DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial among MSM participating in the Amsterdam PrEP demonstration project (AMPrEP). METHODS: Eligible participants were randomized 1 : 1 to the control or intervention app. Both allowed daily reporting of sexual behaviour and medication intake; the intervention app also provided visual feedback. Dried blood spots collected at 12 and 24 months yielded intracellular tenofovir diphosphate concentrations (TFV‐DP). We assessed proportions of participants with poor (TFV‐DP <700 fmol/punch; primary outcome), good (TFV‐DP ≥700 fmol/punch) and excellent (TFV‐DP ≥1250 fmol/punch; secondary outcome) adherence at both time‐points, and the association with the control or intervention app. RESULTS: We randomized 229 participants, 118 to the intervention and 111 to the control arm. The primary, per‐protocol, analysis included 83 participants per arm. In total, 22/166 (13%) of participants adhered poorly, 144/166 (87%) good and 66/166 (40%) excellently. App feedback did not result in a lower proportion of participants with poor adherence [control: 9 of 83 (11%); intervention: 13 of 83 (16%); P = 0.36]. App feedback did result in a larger proportion of participants with excellent adherence [control: 26/83 (31%); intervention: 40/83 (48%); P = 0.026]. CONCLUSION: In this highly adherent population, app feedback did not improve the proportion of participants with poor adherence to PrEP.Clinical Trial Number Netherlands Trial Register: NL5413.

AB  - Background: Oncokompas is a web‐based self‐management application that supports cancer survivors to monitor their health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms, and to obtain personalised feedback and tailored options for supportive care. In a large randomised controlled trial among survivors of head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer and (non‐)Hodgkin lymphoma, Oncokompas proved to improve HRQOL, and to reduce several tumour‐specific symptoms. Effect sizes were however small, and no effect was observed on the primary outcome patient activation. Therefore, this study aims to explore which subgroups of cancer survivors may especially benefit from Oncokompas. Materials and methods: Cancer survivors (n = 625) were randomly assigned to the intervention group (access to Oncokompas, n = 320) or control group (6 months waiting list, n = 305). Outcome measures were HRQOL, tumour‐specific symptoms, and patient activation. Potential moderators included socio‐demographic (sex, age, marital status, education, employment), clinical (tumour type, stage, time since diagnosis, treatment modality, comorbidities), and personal factors (self‐efficacy, personal control, health literacy, Internet use), and patient activation, mental adjustment to cancer, HRQOL, symptoms, and need for supportive care, measured at baseline. Linear mixed models were performed to investigate potential moderators. Results: The intervention effect on HRQOL was the largest among cancer survivors with low to moderate self‐efficacy, and among those with high personal control and those with high health literacy scores. Cancer survivors with higher baseline symptom scores benefitted more on head and neck (pain in the mouth, social eating, swallowing, coughing, trismus), and colorectal cancer (weight) specific symptoms. Discussion: Oncokompas seems most effective in reducing symptoms in head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer survivors who report a higher burden of tumour‐specific symptoms. Oncokompas seems most effective in improving HRQOL in cancer survivors with lower self‐efficacy, and in cancer survivors with higher personal control, and higher health literacy.

AB  - Background: Knowledge about the efficacy of behavioural intervention technologies that can be used by cancer survivors independently from a health‐care provider is scarce. We aimed to assess the efficacy, reach, and usage of Oncokompas, a web‐based eHealth application that supports survivors in self‐management by monitoring health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) and cancer‐generic and tumour‐specific symptoms and obtaining tailored feedback with a personalised overview of supportive care options. Methods: In this non‐blinded, randomised, controlled trial, we recruited patients treated at 14 hospitals in the Netherlands for head and neck cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, or non‐Hodgkin lymphoma. Adult survivors (aged â‰¥18 years) were recruited through the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) and invited by their treating physician through the Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by an independent researcher to the intervention group (access to Oncokompas) or control group (access to Oncokompas after 6 months), by use of block randomisation (block length of 68), stratified by tumour type. The primary outcome was patient activation (knowledge, skills, and confidence for self‐management), assessed at baseline, post‐intervention, and 3‐month and 6‐month follow‐up. Linear mixed models (intention‐to‐treat) were used to assess group differences over time from baseline to 6‐month follow‐up. The trial is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR5774 and is completed. Findings: Between Oct 12, 2016, and May 24, 2018, 625 (21%) of 2953 survivors assessed for eligibility were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention (320) or control group (305). Median follow‐up was 6 months (IQR 6âˆ’6). Patient activation was not significantly different between intervention and control group over time (difference at 6‐month follow‐up 1Â·7 [95% CI âˆ’0Â·8â€“4Â·1], p=0Â·41). Interpretation: Oncokompas did not improve the amount of knowledge, skills, and confidence for self‐management in cancer survivors. This study contributes to the evidence for the development of tailored strategies for development and implementation of behavioural intervention technologies among cancer survivors. Funding: Dutch Cancer Society (KWF Kankerbestrijding).

AB  - Background: Evidence‐based cognitive rehabilitation programs for brain tumor patients are not widely available, despite the high need. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a tablet‐based cognitive rehabilitation program on cognitive performance, cognitive complaints, fatigue, and psychological distress in primary brain tumor patients following neurosurgery. Also, attrition, adherence and patient satisfaction with the program were evaluated. Methods: Adults with presumed low‐grade glioma and meningioma were recruited before surgery. Three months thereafter, participants were allocated to the intervention group or waiting‐list control group using minimization. The 10‐week eHealth app ReMind, based on the effective face‐to‐face intervention, consisted of psychoeducation, strategy‐training and attention retraining. Performance‐based cognitive outcomes and patient‐reported outcomes were assessed before surgery and 3, 6 and 12 months thereafter. Mean scores, percentages of cognitively impaired individuals and reliable change indices (RCIs) were compared between groups. Results: Sixty‐two out of 183 eligible patients were randomized. Of the people who declined, 56% reported that participation would to be too burdensome. All participants found a tablet‐app suitable for delivery of cognitive rehabilitation and 90% rated the program as ?good? or ?excellent?. Performance‐based cognitive outcomes and patient‐reported outcomes did not significantly differ in group means over time nor RCIs between the intervention (final n = 20) and control group (final n = 25). Conclusions: Recruitment at this early stage was difficult, resulting in limited statistical power. No significant effects were demonstrated, while adherence and satisfaction with the eHealth program were good. In clinical practice, ReMind may be helpful, if timing would be adapted to patients? needs.

AB  - <b>Background</b>: Despite the fact that many people are affected by trauma and suffer from posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) there is a lack of easy-accessible interventions to self-manage these symptoms. Mobile apps may deliver low-intensity self-help to reduce trauma-related symptoms and empower individuals following trauma, such as high-risk professionals who are regularly exposed to potentially traumatic events. In this randomized controlled trial, we examined the efficacy, and evaluated the usability and user satisfaction of the app 'SUPPORT Coach' as a self-help tool to reduce trauma-related symptoms. <b>Methods</b>: Health care professionals (e.g. nurses, physicians, paramedics and ambulance drivers) completed an online screening on PTSS (T0). They were randomized when at least one PTSS was reported, either to the intervention (1 month unlimited access to SUPPORT Coach) or control condition (no access to SUPPORT Coach). Self-reported PTSS, negative trauma-related cognitions, psychological resilience, and social support were assessed online at baseline (T1), post-condition (T2), and 1 month follow-up (T3). <b>Results</b>: Of the 1175 participants screened, 287 (24.4%) indicated at least one posttraumatic stress symptom and were randomized. The majority of intervention condition participants (83%, n = 103) used SUPPORT Coach; they were slightly to moderately satisfied with the app. There was no significant group difference in change in PTSS and social support after one-month app usage. However, the intervention condition showed a greater decline in negative trauma-related cognitions at T2 and T3, and a larger increase in psychological resilience at T3 than the control condition. <b>Conclusions</b>: SUPPORT Coach without guidance could potentially provide easy-accessible self-help to diminish negative trauma-related cognitions, and strengthen resilience in coping with adversities. However, since the attrition rate was substantially higher in the intervention than in control condition, our findings should be interpreted with caution and warrant replication.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Major surgery is associated with negative postoperative outcomes such as complications and delayed or poor recovery. Multimodal prehabilitation can help to reduce the negative effects of major surgery. Offering prehabilitation by means of mobile health (mHealth) could be an effective new approach. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this pilot study were to (1) evaluate the usability of the Be Prepared mHealth app prototype for people undergoing major surgery, (2) explore whether the app was capable of bringing about a change in risk behaviors, and (3) estimate a preliminary effect of the app on functional recovery after major surgery. METHODS: A mixed‐methods pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in two Dutch academic hospitals. In total, 86 people undergoing major surgery participated. Participants in the intervention group received access to the Be Prepared app, a smartphone app using behavior change techniques to address risk behavior prior to surgery. Both groups received care as usual. Usability (System Usability Scale), change in risk behaviors 3 days prior to surgery, and functional recovery 30 days after discharge from hospital (Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical functioning 8‐item short form) were assessed using online questionnaires. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi‐square tests, and multivariable linear regression. Semistructured interviews about the usability of the app were conducted with 12 participants in the intervention group. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: Seventy‐nine people‐40 in the intervention group and 39 in the control group‐were available for further analysis. Participants had a median age of 61 (interquartile range 51.0‐68.0) years. The System Usability Scale showed that patients considered the Be Prepared app to have acceptable usability (mean 68.2 [SD 18.4]). Interviews supported the usability of the app. The major point of improvement identified was further personalization of the app. Compared with the control group, the intervention group showed an increase in self‐reported physical activity and muscle strengthening activities prior to surgery. Also, 2 of 2 frequent alcohol users in the intervention group versus 1 of 9 in the control group drank less alcohol in the run‐up to surgery. No difference was found in change of smoking cessation. Between‐group analysis showed no meaningful differences in functional recovery after correction for baseline values (β=‐2.4 [95% CI ‐5.9 to 1.1]). CONCLUSIONS: The Be Prepared app prototype shows potential in terms of usability and changing risk behavior prior to major surgery. No preliminary effect of the app on functional recovery was found. Points of improvement have been identified with which the app and future research can be optimized. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Registry NL8623; https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8623.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an mHealth intervention (intervention using mobile technology) consisting of tailored advice regarding exposure to daylight, sleep, physical activity, and nutrition, and aiming to improve health‐related behavior, thereby reducing sleep problems and fatigue and improving health perception of airline pilots. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted among 502 airline pilots. The intervention group was given access to both the MORE Energy mobile application (app) with tailored advice and a website with background information. The control group was directed to a website with standard information about fatigue. Health‐related behavior, fatigue, sleep, and health perception outcomes were measured through online questionnaires at baseline and at three and six months after baseline. The effectiveness of the intervention was determined using linear and Poisson mixed model analyses. RESULTS: After six months, compared to the control group, the intervention group showed a significant improvement on fatigue (β= ‐3.76, P<0.001), sleep quality (β= ‐0.59, P=0.007), strenuous physical activity (β=0.17, P=0.028), and snacking behavior (β= ‐0.81, P<0.001). No significant effects were found for other outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: The MORE Energy mHealth intervention reduced self‐reported fatigue compared to a minimal intervention. Some aspects of health‐related behavior (physical activity and snacking behavior) and sleep (sleep quality) improved as well, but most did not. The results show offering tailored advice through an mHealth intervention is an effective means to support employees who have to cope with irregular flight schedules and circadian disruption. This kind of intervention might therefore also be beneficial for other working populations with irregular working hours.

AB  - Although several hundreds of apps are available that (cl)aim to promote mindfulness, only a few methodologically sound studies have evaluated the efficacy of these apps. This randomized waiting-list controlled trial therefore tested the hypothesis that one such app (the VGZ Mindfulness Coach) can achieve immediate and long-term improvements of mindfulness, quality of life, general psychiatric symptoms, and self-actualization. One hundred ninety-one experimental participants received the VGZ Mindfulness Coach, which offers 40 mindfulness exercises and background information about mindfulness without any form of therapeutic guidance. Compared to 186 control participants, they reported large (Cohen's d = 0.77) and statistically significant increases of mindfulness after 8 weeks and small-to-medium increases of the Observing, Describing, Acting with awareness, Nonjudging, and Nonreactivity mindfulness facets as measured with the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (Cohen's d = 0.66, 0.26, 0.49, 0.34, and 0.43, respectively). Also, there were large decreases of general psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12; Cohen's d = -0.68) and moderate increases of psychological, social, and environmental quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF; Cohen's d = 0.38, 0.38, and 0.36, respectively). Except for social quality of life, these gains were maintained for at least 3 months. We conclude that it is possible to achieve durable positive effects on mindfulness, general psychiatric symptoms, and several aspects of quality of life at low costs with smartphone apps for mindfulness such as the VGZ Mindfulness Coach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: E‐health has the potential to facilitate implementation of effective measures to prevent sports injuries. AIM: We evaluated whether an interactive mobile application containing a proven effective exercise programme to prevent recurrent ankle sprains resulted in higher compliance as compared with regular written exercise materials. METHODS: 220 athletes participated in this randomised controlled trial with a follow‐up of 8 weeks; 110 athletes received a booklet explaining an 8‐week neuromuscular training programme; 110 athletes participated in the same programme in an interactive mobile App (Strengthen your ankle). The primary outcome was compliance with the exercise programme. Secondary outcome measure was the incidence density of self‐reported recurrent ankle sprains. RESULTS: The mean compliance to the exercise scheme was 73.3% (95% CI 67.7% to 78.1%) in the App group, compared with 76.7% (95% CI 71.9% to 82.3%) in the Booklet group. No significant difference in compliance was found between groups. The incidence densities of self‐reported time‐loss recurrences were not significantly different between both groups (HR 3.07; 95% CI 0.62 to 15.20). SUMMARY: This study shows that the method of implementing the exercises by using an App or a Booklet does not lead to different compliance rates. NEW FINDINGS: The use of a mobile App or a Booklet lead to similar compliance and injury rates in the short term. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: The Netherlands National Trial Register NTR 4027. The NTR is part of the WHO Primary Registries.

AB  - Objectives: Recurrent ankle sprains can be reduced by a neuromuscular training program (NMT). The way NMT is delivered may influence the incidence of long term recurrent injuries, residual pain and disability. Design: This RCT with a follow‐up of twelve months, evaluated whether the implementation method of a proven effective NMT program delivered by a mobile application or a written instruction booklet, resulted in differences in injury incidence rates, functional ankle disability/pain in the long term, assuming equal compliance ‐ as is shown in previous research ‐ with the 8‐week intervention. Methods: 220 athletes with a history of ankle sprain were recruited for this RCT. 110 athletes were offered the freely available Strengthen your ankle App and the other 110 received a printed Booklet. Primary outcome measure was incidence density of ankle sprains. Secondary outcome measures were residual pain/disability and the individual cumulative number of ankle sprains during follow‐up. Results: The incidence densities of self‐reported ankle sprain recurrences were not significantly different between both groups (HR 1.06; 95% CI 0.76‐1.49). Median FADI (Functional Ankle and Disability Index) scores increased equally over time in both groups, indicating a lower rate of limitation and pain in both groups at follow‐up. Neither FADI scores nor cumulative recurrent injuries were significantly different between groups. Conclusions: This study showed that the implementation method of a NMT program by using an App or a Booklet did neither lead to different injury incidence rates in the long term nor did it influence residual functional disability/pain. Assuming equal compliance during the 8‐week intervention, both methods show similar effectiveness in twelve‐month follow‐up. Copyright © 2016.

Cumbersome technology and lack of a human coach may have contributed to the limitations of prior interventions. In response, the current program of research created a comprehensive electronically delivered lifestyle intervention using a user‐friendly, interactive, smartphone app‐based model, and evaluated it in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Twenty‐eight adults, body mass index 25–42 kg/m2, with smartphones and sedentary jobs, were randomized to the intervention, along with conventional outpatient weight‐management visits every 3 months, or to a wait‐listed control group that received only weight‐management visits. The intervention included wearable activity trackers, smartscales, food photography logs, physician‐driven app‐based behavioral coaching, and peer support via the app. The prespecified primary outcome was a comparison of change in weight in kilograms, in the intervention versus control group at 6 months. Results: At 6 months, the intervention group experienced a statistically significant weight change of −7.16 ± 1.78 kg (mean ± SE, 95% CI −11.05 to −3.26, p < 0.01), which differed from the weight change in controls by −4.16 ± 2.01 kg (95% CI −8.29 to −0.02, p < 0.05, prespecified primary outcome). Weight change in the control group was −3.00 ± 1.05 kg (95% CI −5.27 to −0.73, p < 0.05). Waist circumference and hemoglobin A1c significantly improved (intervention vs. control: p < 0.01, p < 0.05, respectively, prespecified secondary outcomes). Weight change in the intervention group correlated with numbers of food photographs participants shared (rho = −0.86, p < 0.01), numbers of their text messages (rho = −0.80, p < 0.01), number of times and days each participant stepped on the smartscale (rho = −0.73, p < 0.01; rho = −0.608, p < 0.05, respectively), and mean daily step counts (rho = −0.55, p < 0.05). Conclusion: This app‐based electronically delivered lifestyle intervention produced statistically significant, clinically meaningful weight loss and improved metabolic health. Engagement with the intervention correlated strongly with weight loss. Given the limited sample size, larger and longer studies of this intervention are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes lack information on which commercially available applications (apps) improve diabetes-related outcomes. We conducted a rapid evidence review to examine features, clinical efficacy, and usability of apps for self-management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in adults. METHODS: Ovid/Medline and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for systematic reviews and technology assessments. Reference lists of relevant systematic reviews were examined for primary studies. Additional searches for primary studies were conducted online, through Ovid/Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov . Studies were evaluated for eligibility based on predetermined criteria, data were extracted, study quality was assessed using a risk of bias tool, information on app features was collected, and app usability was assessed. Results are summarized qualitatively. RESULTS: Fifteen articles evaluating 11 apps were identified: six apps for type 1 and five apps for type 2 diabetes. Common features of apps included setting reminders and tracking blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), medication use, physical activity, and weight. Compared with controls, use of eight apps, when paired with support from a healthcare provider or study staff, improved at least one outcome, most often HbA1c. Patients did not experience improvements in quality of life, blood pressure, or weight, regardless of app used or type of diabetes. Study quality was variable. Of the eight apps available for usability testing, two were scored "acceptable," three were "marginal," and three were "not acceptable." DISCUSSION: Limited evidence suggests that use of some commercially available apps, when combined with additional support from a healthcare provider or study staff, may improve some short-term diabetes-related outcomes. The impact of these apps on longer-term outcomes is unclear. More rigorous and longer-term studies of apps are needed. REGISTRATION: This review was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).

AB  - BACKGROUND: In HIV treatment program, gaps in the "cascade of care" where patients are lost between diagnosis, laboratory evaluation, treatment initiation, and retention in HIV care, is a well-described challenge. Growing access to internet-enabled mobile phones has led to an interest in using the technology to improve patient engagement with health care. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this trial were: (1) to assess whether a mobile phone-enabled app could provide HIV patients with laboratory test results, (2) to better understand the implementation of such an intervention, and (3) to determine app effectiveness in improving linkage to HIV care after diagnosis. METHODS: We developed and tested an app through a randomized controlled trial carried out in several primary health care facilities in Johannesburg. Newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients were screened, recruited, and randomized into the trial as they were giving a blood sample for initial CD4 staging. Trial eligibility included ownership of a phone compatible with the app and access to the internet. Trial participants were followed for a minimum of eight months to determine linkage to HIV care indicated by an HIV-related laboratory test result. RESULTS: The trial outcome results are being prepared for publication, but here we describe the significant operational and technological lessons provided by the implementation. Android was identified as the most suitable operating system for the app, due to Android functionality and communication characteristics. Android also had the most significant market share of all smartphone operating systems in South Africa. The app was successfully developed with laboratory results sent to personal smartphones. However, given the trial requirements and the app itself, only 10% of screened HIV patients successfully enrolled. We report on issues such as patient eligibility, app testing in a dynamic phone market, software installation and compatibility, safe identification of patients, linkage of laboratory results to patients lacking unique identifiers, and present lessons and potential solutions. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation challenges and lessons of this trial may assist future similar mHealth interventions to avoid some of the pitfalls. Ensuring sufficient expertise and understanding of the programmatic needs by the software developer, as well as in the implementation team, with adequate and rapid piloting within the target groups, could have led to better trial recruitment. However, the majority of screened patients were interested in the study, and the app was installed successfully in patients with suitable smartphones, suggesting that this may be a way to engage patients with their health care data in future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: South Africa provides free antiretroviral therapy for almost 5 million people living with HIV, but only 71% of the eligible people are on treatment, representing a shortfall in the care cascade, especially among men and youth. Many developing countries have expanded access to smartphones; success in health apps raises the possibility of improving this cascade. OBJECTIVE: SmartLink is a health app for Android smartphones providing HIV‐related laboratory results, information, support, and appointment reminders to engage and link patients to care. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of SmartLink to improve linkage to care for HIV‐positive smartphone owners. METHODS: This study was a multisite randomized controlled trial in Johannesburg. The intervention arm received the app (along with referral to a treatment site) and the control arm received the standard of care (referral alone). Linkage to care was confirmed by an HIV‐related blood test reported on the National Health Laboratory Service database between 2 weeks and 8 months after initiation. RESULTS: A total of 345 participants were recruited into the study; 64.9% (224/345) of the participants were female and 44.1% (152/345) were aged less than 30 years. In addition, 46.7% (161/345) were employed full time, 95.9% (331/345) had at least secondary school education, and 35.9% (124/345) were from Zimbabwe. Linkage to care between 2 weeks and 8 months was 48.6% (88/181) in the intervention arm versus 45.1% (74/164) in the control (P=.52) and increased to 64.1% (116/181) and 61.0% (100/164) (P=.55), respectively, after the initial 8‐month period. Moreover, youth aged 18 to 30‐years showed a statistically significant 20% increase in linkage to care for the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Youth aged less than 30 years have been historically difficult to reach with traditional interventions, and the SmartLink app provides a proof of concept that this population reacts to mobile health interventions that engage patients in HIV care.

AB  - AbstractObjectiveExisting meta-analyses of mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) suggest inconsistent effects, and few focus on technology-enabled MBPs. Technology-enabled MBPs are programs delivered via the Internet in web apps, which are accessed through Internet browsers, or native apps, which are applications installed directly on smart mobile devices. This meta-analysis provides an updated synthesis of technology-enabled MBPs’ effects on negative affect and mindfulness and discusses the role of moderators in these effects.MethodsA search was conducted through August 2019 of databases PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and the website MINDFULNET.org for original randomized clinical trials focused on technology-enabled MBPs. Additional inclusion criteria included English language publications and outcome measures of negative affect and/or measures of mindful awareness.ResultsA medium effect was observed of technology-enabled MBPs on stress (Hedges g = − 0.47, 95% CI − 1.02 to 0.21, p < 0.01). Small effects were observed on symptoms of anxiety (Hedges g = − 0.21, 95% CI − 0.39 to − 0.03, p = 0.02) and depression (Hedges g = − 0.25, 95% CI − 0.37 to − 0.12, p < 0.01) as well as mindful awareness (g = 0.4, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.07, p < 0.01). Multivariate regressions and general linear models revealed that intervention duration, percentage of women participants, human-supported interventions, and type of control condition contributed significantly to effect size variability.ConclusionsTechnology-enabled MBPs included in this analysis demonstrated small to medium effects on outcomes of negative affect and mindfulness. Variability in study outcomes appears to be related to experimental and intervention characteristics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - INTRODUCTION: High rates of tobacco use among people with serious mental illness (SMI), along with their unique needs, suggest the importance of developing tailored smoking cessation interventions for this group. Previous early‐phase work empirically validated the design and content of Learn to Quit, a theory‐based app designed for this population. METHODS: In a pilot randomized controlled trial, we compared the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Learn to Quit versus QuitGuide, an app designed for the general population. All participants received nicotine replacement therapy and technical assistance. Daily smokers with SMI (N = 62) participated in the trial with outcomes assessed at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16. RESULTS: Compared to QuitGuide, Learn to Quit participants had similar number of days of app use (34 vs. 32, p = .754), but larger number of app interactions (335 vs. 205; p = .001), longer durations of app use (4.24 hrs. vs. 2.14 hrs; p = .044), and higher usability scores (85 vs. 79, p = .046). At week 16, Learn to Quit led to greater reductions in cigarettes per day (12.3 vs. 5.9 for QuitGuide; p = 0.10). Thirty‐day point prevalence abstinence was verified in 12% of Learn to Quit participants versus 3% of QuitGuide participants (odds ratio = 3.86, confidence interval = 0.41 to 36, p = .239). Changes in psychiatric symptoms and adverse events were not clinically significant between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial provides strong evidence of Learn to Quit's usability, feasibility, and safety. Preliminary evidence suggests the app may be efficacious. A randomized controlled efficacy trial is needed to test the app in a larger sample of smokers with SMI. IMPLICATIONS: This study suggests that the Learn to Quit app is a feasible approach to deliver smoking cessation treatment in patients with co‐occurring tobacco use disorder and SMI. This means that, if found efficacious, this technology could be used to deploy smoking cessation treatment to larger segments of this population, hence improving public health. Therefore, a randomized controlled trial should be conducted to examine the efficacy of this digital intervention.

AB  - Mindfulness interventions have garnered significant attention as a complementary health treatment for many physical and psychological conditions. While some research has shown that mindfulness training can decrease psychological and physiological stress responses, it remains unclear whether mindfulness training impacts inflammation—a predictor of poor health outcomes. In addition, little research has examined the active components of mindfulness that may drive health-related improvements. Here, we provide data from two 3-arm randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of mindfulness training on inflammation in stressed community adults. Specifically, we examined whether training individuals to have an accepting attitude towards present moment experiences is a key emotion regulation skill that can lead to decreases in inflammation. Both studies randomly assigned participants to one of three conditions: mindfulness training that taught both attention monitoring and acceptance skills (Monitor+Accept); mindfulness training teaching monitoring without the acceptance component (Monitor Only); or a control condition. Study 1 employed a novel 2-week smartphone-based intervention and Study 2 employed a standard 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention. We hypothesized that Monitor+Accept training would lead to reductions in the inflammatory biomarker C-Reactive Protein (CRP) compared to Monitor Only training and control groups. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that Monitor+Accept mindfulness training did not lead to reductions in CRP. Exploratory analyses combining study subsamples, however, suggest that both mindfulness interventions may reduce CRP in populations at risk for systemic inflammation—midlife-to-older adults and individuals with high BMI. Overall, the present studies contribute significantly to the question of whether mindfulness interventions can reduce systemic markers of low-grade inflammation.

AB  - A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the effectiveness of app-based mobile interventions for improving nutrition behaviours and nutrition-related health outcomes, including obesity indices (eg, body mass index [BMI]) and clinical parameters (eg, blood lipids). Seven databases were searched for studies published between 2006 and 2017. Forty-one of 10 132 identified records were included, comprising 6348 participants and 373 outcomes with sample sizes ranging from 10 to 833, including 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A beneficial effect of app-based mobile interventions was identified for improving nutrition behaviours (g = 0.19; CI, 0.06-0.32, P = .004) and nutrition-related health outcomes (g = 0.23; CI, 0.11-0.36, P < .001), including positive effects on obesity indices (g = 0.30; CI, 0.15-0.45, P < .001), blood pressure (g = 0.21; CI, 0.01-0.42, P = .043), and blood lipids (g = 0.15; CI, 0.03-0.28, P = .018). Most interventions were composed of four behaviour change technique (BCT) clusters, namely, "goals/planning," "feedback/monitoring," "shaping knowledge," and "social support." Moderating effects including study design, type of app (commercial/research app), sample characteristics (clinical/non-clinical sample), and intervention characteristics were not statistically significant. The inclusion of additional treatment components besides the app or the number or type of BCTs implemented did not moderate the observed effectiveness, which underscores the potential of app-based mobile interventions for implementing effective and feasible interventions operating at scale for fighting the obesity epidemic in a broad spectrum of the population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite current guidelines recommending women with ovarian cancer receive genetic risk evaluation by a genetic counselor, utilization has historically been low. We sought to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a week‐long mobile Application for Genetic Information on Cancer (mAGIC) intervention aimed to persuade women with ovarian cancer to pursue genetic counseling. METHODS: The mobile application intervention was based on the Fogg Behavior Model, and consisted of three parts: (1) identifying barriers, (2) developing motivators, and (3) providing triggers to action. The Health Belief Model was used to guide content development. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled pilot trial among 104 untested women with a history of epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer with the primary objective of increasing uptake of cancer genetic counseling services. RESULTS: Utilization of cancer genetic counseling services improved in both study arms over historical controls, however there was no statistically significant difference between them (intervention: 54.5% versus control: 38.6%; p = 0.14). However, compared to controls, women randomized to the mAGIC intervention demonstrated greater knowledge of hereditary cancer (0‐10 scale; 9.4 ± 1.0 vs. 7.1 ± 1.5; p < 0.0001), which persisted for at least three months. Additionally, 96% of women in the intervention group reported they had talked with their family about genetic counseling compared to 77% in the control group (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The mAGIC intervention did not result in increased uptake of genetic counseling, however it provided significant secondary benefits, including increased participants' knowledge about hereditary ovarian cancer, self‐efficacy, and their reported communication with family members.

AB  - Physical inactivity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with poor health status and increased disease burden. The present study aims to test the efficacy of a previously developed mobile (m)Health intervention to improve or maintain physical activity in patients with COPD after pulmonary rehabilitation.A randomised controlled trial was performed in 32 physiotherapy practices in the Netherlands. COPD patients were randomised into intervention or usual care groups. The intervention consisted of a smartphone application for the patients and a monitoring website for the physiotherapists. Measurements were performed at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months. Physical activity, functional exercise capacity, lung function, health‐related quality of life and body mass index were assessed.157 patients started the study and 121 completed it. There were no significant positive effects of the intervention on physical activity (at 0 months: intervention 5824±3418 steps per weekday, usual care 5717±2870 steps per weekday; at 12 months: intervention 4819±2526 steps per weekday, usual care 4950±2634 steps per weekday; p=0.811) or on the secondary end‐points. There was a significant decrease over time in physical activity (p<0.001), lung function (p<0.001) and mastery (p=0.017), but not in functional exercise capacity (p=0.585).Although functional exercise capacity did not deteriorate, our mHealth intervention did not improve or maintain physical activity in patients with COPD after a period of pulmonary rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Use of mobile health (mHealth) technology is on an exponential rise. mHealth apps have the capability to reach a large number of individuals, but until now have lacked the integration of evidence-based theoretical constructs to increase exercise behavior in users. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a theory-based, self-monitoring app on exercise and self-monitoring behavior over 8 weeks. METHODS: A total of 56 adults (mean age 40 years, SD 13) were randomly assigned to either receive the mHealth app (experimental; n=28) or not to receive the app (control; n=28). All participants engaged in an exercise goal-setting session at baseline. Experimental condition participants received weekly short message service (SMS) text messages grounded in social cognitive theory and were encouraged to self-monitor exercise bouts on the app on a daily basis. Exercise behavior, frequency of self-monitoring exercise behavior, self-efficacy to self-monitor, and self-management of exercise behavior were collected at baseline and at postintervention. RESULTS: Engagement in exercise bouts was greater in the experimental condition (mean 7.24, SD 3.40) as compared to the control condition (mean 4.74, SD 3.70, P=.03, d=0.70) at week 8 postintervention. Frequency of self-monitoring increased significantly over the 8-week investigation between the experimental and control conditions (P<.001, partial eta(2)=.599), with participants in the experimental condition self-monitoring significantly more at postintervention (mean 6.00, SD 0.93) in comparison to those in the control condition (mean 1.95, SD 2.58, P<.001, d=2.10). Self-efficacy to self-monitor and perceived self-management of exercise behavior were unaffected by this intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The successful integration of social cognitive theory into an mHealth exercise self-monitoring app provides support for future research to feasibly integrate theoretical constructs into existing exercise apps. In addition, findings provide preliminary support for theory-based apps to increase self-monitoring and exercise behavior in comparison to a control, no-app condition.

mHealth smartphone apps have inundated the market. The promise of mHealth apps is
that they increase access to psychotherapeutic content while also expanding options
beyond face-to-face care. However, information on the quality and efficacy of
commercial mHealth apps is sparse. Pacifica, a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and
Mindfulness-based mHealth app, is one of the most popular and publicly endorsed apps
on the market. An initial week long pilot study was performed to assess feasibility and
acceptability of the Pacifica app and Pacifica Lite, an active control version of the app, in
a group of college students (N = 41). Participants generally used the app as intended and
rated the aesthetics and functionality positively. The subsequent efficacy study extended
the intervention period, added a waitlist control group, and enrolled a greater number of
participants. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first randomized controlled
trial designed to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a commercial mHealth app using
a smartphone active control app as a comparison. Participants (N=420) were randomly
assigned to one of three groups: 1) The Pacifica app that includes the psychotherapybased components, 2) the active control app “Pacifica Lite” without psychotherapy-based
components, and 3) waitlist control. The intervention period was 14 days over the final
weeks of a college semester. Participants completed pretest and posttest measures of
mental health symptoms and general well-being, state-based affect, perceived stress, and
mindfulness prior to and following the intervention period. Regression models with
baseline scores as moderators indicated there was an effect of the Pacifica intervention compared to the Waitlist control on negative affect and global mental health. The effect
of intervention group on negative affect, global mental health, and perceived stress were
all moderated by baseline scores, whereby participants who had higher baseline distress
levels reported greater responses to the Pacifica intervention compared to being on the
Waitlist. A measure of trait mindfulness showed significant between-group differences,
with significantly higher scores in the Pacifica group compared to the waitlist control.
There were no effects related to group at posttest for total or subscale scores for
symptoms of depression, anxiety, positive state-affect, and mindfulness practice. Overall,
the Pacifica app appeared feasible and usable over a high demand final exam period, was
significantly more effective than Waitlist on some measures, but it was not significantly
more effective than the active control on any measures. Pacifica and the majority of
mHealth apps available are not designed as alternatives to face-to-face care but college
counseling centers and healthcare systems may choose to include apps like Pacifica as
additional resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many women experience urgency (UUI) and mixed (MUI) urinary incontinence but commonly hesitate to seek care. Treatment access and self‐management for these conditions can be supported through eHealth approaches. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the mobile app Tät II for self‐management of UUI and MUI in women. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included women ≥18 years old with UUI or MUI and ≥2 leakages per week. Those with red‐flag symptoms were excluded. Participants were recruited via analog and digital advertisements and screened for initial selection through a web‐based questionnaire. Data were collected using another questionnaire and a 2‐day bladder diary. A telephone interview confirmed the symptom diagnosis. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive access to a treatment app (including pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, psychoeducation, lifestyle advice, tailored advice, exercise log, reinforcement messages, and reminders) or an information app (control group), with no external treatment guidance provided. The primary outcome was incontinence symptoms at the 15‐week follow‐up, measured using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)‐Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ‐UI SF). Urgency symptoms were assessed using the ICIQ‐Overactive Bladder Module (ICIQ‐OAB) and quality of life using the ICIQ‐Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life Module (ICIQ‐LUTSqol). Incontinence episode frequency (IEF) was calculated per bladder diary entries. Improvement was measured using the Patient's Global Impression of Improvement. All outcomes were self‐reported. Cure was defined as no leakages per the bladder diary. Intention‐to‐treat analysis was performed. RESULTS: Between April 2017 and March 2018, 123 women (mean age 58.3, SD 9.6 years) were randomized to the treatment (n=60, 2 lost to follow‐up) or information (n=63) group. Of these, 35 (28%) women had UUI, and 88 (72%) had MUI. Mean ICIQ‐UI SF score at follow‐up was lower in the treatment group than in the information group (estimated difference ‐3.1, 95% CI ‐4.8 to ‐1.3). The estimated between‐group difference was ‐1.8 (95% CI ‐2.8 to ‐0.99) for mean ICIQ‐OAB score and ‐6.3 (95% CI ‐10.5 to ‐2.1) for the mean ICIQ‐LUTSqol score at follow‐up. IEF reduction from baseline to follow‐up was greater in the treatment group (‐10.5, IQR ‐17.5 to ‐3.5) than in the information group (P<.001). Improvement was reported by 87% (52/60) of treatment group participants and by 30% (19/63) of information group participants. The cure rate was 32% in the treatment group, and 6% in the information group (odds ratio 5.4, 95% CI 1.9‐15.6; P=.002). About 67% (40/60) of the treatment group participants used the app more than thrice a week. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment app was effective for improving urgency and mixed incontinence in women. When self‐management is appropriate, this app may be a good alternative to pharmacological treatment or other conservative management, thus increasing access to care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a growing concern for society and is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the Accupedo-Pro Pedometer mobile phone app intervention, with the goal of increasing daily step counts in young adults. METHODS: Mobile phone users (n=58) between 17-26 years of age were randomized to one of two conditions (experimental and control). Both groups downloaded an app that recorded their daily step counts. Baseline data were recorded and followed-up at 5 weeks. Both groups were given a daily walking goal of 30 minutes, but the experimental group participants were told the equivalent goal in steps taken, via feedback from the app. The primary outcome was daily step count between baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: A significant time x group interaction effect was observed for daily step counts (P=.04). Both the experimental (P<.001) and control group (P=.03) demonstrated a significant increase in daily step counts, with the experimental group walking an additional 2000 steps per day. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that a mobile phone app can significantly increase physical activity in a young adult sample by setting specific goals, using self-monitoring, and feedback.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training (MT) includes a variety of contemplative practices aimed at promoting intentional awareness of experience, coupled with attitudes of nonjudgment and curiosity. Following the success of 8-week, manualized group interventions, MT has been implemented in a variety of modalities, including smartphone apps that seek to replicate the success of group interventions. However, although smartphone apps are scalable and accessible to a wider swath of population, their benefits remain largely untested. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate a newly developed MT app called Wildflowers, which was codeveloped with the laboratory for use in mindfulness research. It was hypothesized that 3 weeks of MT through this app would improve subjective well-being, attentional control, and interoceptive integration, albeit with weaker effects than those published in the 8 week, manualized group intervention literature. METHODS: Undergraduate students completed 3 weeks of MT with Wildflowers (n=45) or 3 weeks of cognitive training with a game called 2048 (n=41). State training effects were assessed through pre- and postsession ratings of current mood, stress level, and heart rate. Trait training effects were assessed through pre- and postintervention questionnaires canvassing subjective well-being and behavioral task measures of attentional control and interoceptive integration. State and trait training data were analyzed in a multilevel model using emergent latent factors (acceptance, awareness, and openness) to summarize the trait questionnaire battery. RESULTS: Analyses revealed both state and trait effects specific to MT; participants engaging in MT demonstrated improved mood (r=.14) and a reduction of stress (r=-.13) immediately after each training session compared with before the training session and decreased postsession stress over 3 weeks (r=-.08). In addition, MT relative to cognitive training resulted in greater improvements in attentional control (r=-.24). Interestingly, both groups demonstrated increased subjective ratings of awareness (r=.28) and acceptance (r=.23) from pre- to postintervention, with greater changes in acceptance for the MT group trending (r=.21). CONCLUSIONS: MT, using a smartphone app, may provide immediate effects on mood and stress while also providing long-term benefits for attentional control. Although further investigation is warranted, there is evidence that with continued usage, MT via a smartphone app may provide long-term benefits in changing how one relates to their inner and outer experiences.

AB  - Background: Cancer survivorship in Ireland is increasing in both frequency and longevity. However, a significant proportion of cancer survivors do not reach the recommended physical activity levels and have overweight. This has implications for both physical and psychological health, including an increased risk of subsequent and secondary cancers. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions demonstrate potential for positive health behavior change, but there is little evidence for the efficacy of mobile technology in improving health outcomes in cancer survivors with overweight or obesity.
Objective: This study aims to investigate whether a personalized mHealth behavior change intervention improves physical and psychological health outcomes in cancer survivors with overweight or obesity.
Methods: A sample of 123 cancer survivors (BMI≥25 kg/m2) was randomly assigned to the standard care control (n=61) or intervention (n=62) condition. Group allocation was unblinded. The intervention group attended a 4-hour tailored lifestyle education and information session with physiotherapists, a dietician, and a clinical psychologist to support self-management of health behavior. Over the following 12 weeks, participants engaged in personalized goal setting to incrementally increase physical activity (with feedback and review of goals through SMS text messaging contact with the research team). Direct measures of physical activity were collected using a Fitbit accelerometer. Data on anthropometric, functional exercise capacity, dietary behavior, and psychological measures were collected at face-to-face assessments in a single hospital site at baseline (T0), 12 weeks (T1; intervention end), and 24 weeks (T2; follow-up).
Results: The rate of attrition was 21% (13/61) for the control condition and 14% (9/62) for the intervention condition. Using intent-to-treat analysis, significant reductions in BMI (F2,242=4.149; P=.02; ηp2=0.033) and waist circumference (F2,242=3.342; P=.04; ηp2=0.027) were observed in the intervention group. Over the 24-week study, BMI was reduced by 0.52 in the intervention condition, relative to a nonsignificant reduction of 0.11 in the control arm. Waist circumference was reduced by 3.02 cm in the intervention condition relative to 1.82 cm in the control condition. Physical activity level was significantly higher in the intervention group on 8 of the 12 weeks of the intervention phase and on 5 of the 12 weeks of the follow-up period, accounting for up to 2500 additional steps per day (mean 2032, SD 270).
Conclusions: The results demonstrate that for cancer survivors with a BMI≥25 kg/m2, lifestyle education and personalized goal setting using mobile technology can yield significant changes in clinically relevant health indicators. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of behavior change and explore the capacity for mHealth interventions to improve broader health and well-being outcomes in the growing population of cancer survivors.

AB  - Importance: Melanoma is among the most lethal skin cancers; it has become the fifth most common cancer in the United Kingdom, and incidence rates are rising. Population approaches to reducing incidence have focused on mass media campaigns to promote earlier presentation and potentially improve melanoma outcomes; however, interventions using smartphone applications targeting those with the greatest risk could promote earlier presentation to health care professionals for individuals with new or changing skin lesions. Objective: To study the effect of a commercially available skin self‐monitoring (SSM) smartphone application among individuals with increased risk of melanoma on their decision to seek help for changing skin lesions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted in 12 family practices in Eastern England between 2016 and 2017. A total of 238 participants, aged 18 to 75 years and with an increased risk of melanoma, were identified using a real‐Time melanoma risk assessment tool in family practice waiting rooms. Analysis was intention to treat. Participants were observed for 12 months, and data analysis was conducted from January to August 2018. Intervention: The intervention and control groups received a consultation with standard written advice on sun protection and skin cancer detection. The intervention group had an SSM application loaded on their smartphone and received instructions for use and monthly self‐monitoring reminders. Main Outcomes and Measures: The coprimary outcomes were skin consultation rates with family practice physicians and patient intervals, measured as the time between noticing a skin change and consulting with a family practice clinician. Follow‐up questionnaires were sent at 6 and 12 months, and consultation rates were extracted from family practice records. Secondary outcomes included skin self‐examination benefits and barriers, self‐efficacy for consulting without delay, perceived melanoma risk, sun protection habits, and potential harms. Results: A total of 238 patients were randomized (median [interquartile range] age, 55 [43‐65] years, 131 [55.0%] women, 227 [95.4%] white British; 119 [50.0%] randomized to the intervention group). Overall, 51 participants (21.4%) had consultations regarding skin changes during the 12 months of follow‐up, and 157 participants (66.0%) responded to at least 1 follow‐up questionnaire. There were no significant differences in skin consultation rates (adjusted risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.56 to 1.66; P =.89), measures of SSM (adjusted mean difference, 0.08; 95% CI,‐0.83 to 1.00; P =.86), or psychological harm (eg, Melanoma Worry Scale: Adjusted mean difference,‐0.12; 95% CI,‐0.56 to 0.31; P =.58). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, recruitment, retention, and initial delivery of the intervention were feasible, and this research provided no evidence of harm from the SSM smartphone application. However, no evidence of benefit on skin self‐examination or health care consulting was found, and there is no reason at this stage to recommend its implementation in this population at increased risk of melanoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sufficient bowel preparation is crucial for successful screening and surveillance colonoscopy. However, rates of inadequate preparation are still high. We investigated the effects of reinforced patient education using a smartphone application software (APP) for colonoscopy preparation in participants in a CRC screening program. METHODS: We performed a prospective, endoscopist‐blinded study of 500 patients undergoing split‐dose bowel preparation for CRC screening or surveillance colonoscopies at multiple centers in Germany, from November 2017 through January 2019. Participants (n=500) were given oral and written instructions during their initial appointment and then randomly assigned (1:1) to groups that received reinforced education starting 3 days before the colonoscopy (APP group) or no further education (controls). The primary outcome was quality of bowel preparation according to the Boston bowel preparation scale. Secondary outcomes included polyp and adenoma detection rates, compliance with low‐fiber diet, split‐dose laxative intake, perceived discomfort from the preparation procedure. RESULTS: The mean Boston bowel preparation scale score was significantly higher in the APP‐group (7.6Â±0.1) than in the control group (6.7Â±0.1) (P<.0001). The percentage of patients with insufficient bowel preparation was significantly lower in the APP group (8%) than in the control group (17%) (P=.0023). The adenoma detection rate was significantly higher in the APP group (35% vs 27% in controls) (P =.0324). Use of the APP was accompanied by a lower level of non‐compliance with correct laxative intake (P =.0080) and diet instructions (P =.0089). The APP group reported a lower level of discomfort during preparation (P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial, reinforcing patient education with a smartphone application optimized bowel preparation in the 3 days before colonoscopy, increasing bowel cleanliness, adenoma detection, and compliance in patients undergoing CRC screening or surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Self-monitoring is a cornerstone of behavioral lifestyle interventions for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Mobile technology has the potential to improve adherence to self-monitoring and patient outcomes. However, no study has tested the use of a smartphone to facilitate self-monitoring in overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in the underserved community. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of and compare preliminary efficacy of a behavioral lifestyle intervention using smartphone- or paper-based self-monitoring of multiple behaviors on weight loss and glycemic control in a sample of overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus living in underserved communities. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a behavioral lifestyle intervention. Overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited from an underserved minority community health center in Houston, Texas. They were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: (1) behavior intervention with smartphone-based self-monitoring, (2) behavior intervention with paper diary-based self-monitoring, and (3) usual care group. Both the mobile and paper groups received a total of 11 face-to-face group sessions in a 6-month intervention. The mobile group received an Android-based smartphone with 2 apps loaded to help them record their diet, physical activity, weight, and blood glucose, along with a connected glucometer, whereas the paper group used paper diaries for these recordings. Primary outcomes of the study included percentage weight loss and glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) changes over 6 months. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients were enrolled: 11 in the mobile group, 9 in the paper group, and 6 in the control group. We had 92% (24/26) retention rate at 6 months. The sample is predominantly African Americans with an average age of 56.4 years and body mass index of 38.1. Participants lost an average of 2.73% (mobile group) and 0.13% (paper group) weight at 6 months, whereas the control group had an average 0.49% weight gain. Their HbA<sub>1c</sub> changed from 8% to 7 % in mobile group, 10% to 9% in paper group, and maintained at 9% for the control group. We found a significant difference on HbA<sub>1c</sub> at 6 months among the 3 groups (P=.01). We did not find statistical group significance on percentage weight loss (P=.20) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> changes (P=.44) overtime; however, we found a large effect size of 0.40 for weight loss and a medium effect size of 0.28 for glycemic control. CONCLUSIONS: Delivering a simplified behavioral lifestyle intervention using mobile health-based self-monitoring in an underserved community is feasible and acceptable and shows higher preliminary efficacy, as compared with paper-based self-monitoring. A full-scale randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm the findings in this pilot study.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the effects of a home care mobile app on the outcomes of stoma patients who discharged from hospital. BACKGROUND: Patients with a newly formed stoma experience many difficulties after surgery. Mobile application (app) has the potential to help patients self‐manage their diseases and adjust to the changes in their lives and is a convenient way to ensure the continuity of care. However, there is a lack of studies about the effects of a mobile app on the transitional care for improving discharged stoma‐related health outcomes. DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 203 patients with a permanent stoma in tertiary hospitals in China were randomly assigned into two groups. Patients in the control group (n = 103) received routine discharge care. Patients in the intervention group (n = 100) received home care via a mobile app besides routine care. The psychosocial adjustment level, self‐efficacy scale and stoma complications incidence were measured in the follow‐up period and compared between the two groups. Data were collected at four time points: before intervention (baseline), at 1, 3 and 6 months after discharge. RESULTS: The psychosocial adjustment level and stoma self‐efficacy score of the intervention group were significantly higher than those of the control group, respectively, at 1‐, 3‐ and 6‐month follow‐up (all p < 0.05). The incidence of stoma complications in the intervention group was tending to reduce at 1, 3 and 6 months after discharge. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that follow‐up care at home via a mobile app can effectively improve the psychosocial adjustment level, self‐efficacy scale and other related outcomes of stoma patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The home care mobile app is an effective intervention to support the psychosocial adjustment and self‐efficacy of stoma patients after discharge. It ensures the continuity of care and provides nursing guidance for the patients timely.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As an insulin-dependent disease, type 1 diabetes requires paying close attention to the glycemic control. Studies have shown that mobile health (mHealth) can improve the management of chronic diseases. However, the effectiveness of mHealth in controlling the glycemic control remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis using the available literature reporting findings on mHealth interventions, which may improve the management of type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of all studies in the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMbase databases that used mHealth (including mobile phones) in diabetes care and reported glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values as a measure of glycemic control. The fixed effects model was used for this meta-analysis. RESULTS: This study analyzed eight studies, which involved a total of 602 participants. In the meta-analysis, the fixed effects model showed a statistically significant decrease in the mean of HbA1c in the intervention group: − 0.25 (95% confidence interval: − 0.41, − 0.09; P = 0.003, I2 = 12%). Subgroup analyses indicated that the patient's age, the type of intervention, and the duration of the intervention influenced blood glucose control. Funnel plots showed no publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Mobile health interventions may be effective among patients with type 1 diabetes. A significant reduction in HbA1c levels was associated with adult age, the use of a mobile application, and the long-term duration of the intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide disorder that affects millions of people and can exert negative clinical and social effects on the patients. In some previous studies, mobile health applications have been used as a means of clinical intervention. However, the therapeutic effect of continuous care through mobile phone applications for patients with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the clinical effect of continuous care for patients with type 2 diabetes using mobile health application by comparing traditional discharge nursing. METHODS: In total, 120 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly divided into two groups: The test group received continuous care based on the mobile phone application (n = 60), and the control group received conventional care (n = 60). Primary clinical outcomes, such as Glycaemic Haemoglobin (GH) levels, blood glucose levels, self‐care abilities, disease cognition abilities, and the number of readmissions, were examined in both groups. RESULTS: The results showed significant improvements pertaining to disease awareness levels (81.28 vs 71.34, P < .05), self‐management abilities (9.14 vs 7.81, P < .05), GH (‐1.50% vs ‐0.76%, P < .05), fast blood glucose (‐3.23 vs ‐1.25 mmol/L, P < .05), postprandial blood glucose levels (‐4.34 vs ‐2.34 mmol, P < .05), and control levels in the test group. Moreover, in the test group, the frequency of rehospitalisation was reduced during the intervention period, as was the average number of rehospitalisation within 6 months after discharge (‐1.19 vs P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Continuous care based on a mobile health application has potential as a management strategy for patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress urinary incontinence is a distressing and burdensome condition affecting approximately one third of pregnant women and pelvic floor muscle training is recommended as the first‐line treatment. Convenient and cost‐effective regimen of pelvic floor muscle training is required to facilitate the treatment of stress urinary incontinence and improve the adherence to treatment in pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of app‐based audio guidance pelvic floor muscle training on the treatment of stress urinary incontinence in primiparas. DESIGN: The study was a two‐arm, parallel, randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING: The study was conducted in the obstetric clinic of a tertiary maternity hospital in Hangzhou, China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 108 eligible primiparas were enrolled from January to April 2018. METHODS: Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to the audio group or the control group. Primary outcomes included severity of stress urinary incontinence and adherence to pelvic floor muscle training assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire‐Urinary Incontinence Short Form and the Broome Pelvic Muscle Self‐Efficacy Scale, respectively. Secondary outcomes included pelvic floor muscle strength, bladder neck mobility and sexual function measured by vaginal palpation and pelvic floor muscle surface electromyography, perineal ultrasound and Female Sexual Function Index, respectively. Data analysis followed the intention‐to‐treat principle. Generalized estimation equation model, t‐test and chi‐square test were used to examine intervention effect on primary outcomes and secondary outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: Participants showed significant improvement in symptom severity across the study, which was most significant at 6 weeks postpartum (β = ‐4.245, p < 0.001). No significant difference was found in symptom severity between groups (β = ‐0.344, p = 0.168). The interaction effect between intervention and time on adherence was significant. Compared with the control group, greater self‐efficacy was shown in the audio group at 6 weeks (β = 4.425, p = 0.009), 3 months (β = 3.204, p < 0.001) and 6 months (β = 4.457, p < 0.001) postpartum. Participants in the audio group indicated less bladder neck descent (16.5 vs. 19.5, p = 0.020) at 6 weeks postpartum, better pelvic floor muscle strength (12.5% vs. 34.0%, p = 0.012; 4.2% vs. 18.0%, p = 0.030) and sexual function (22.2 vs. 17.3, p = 0.007) at 6 months postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: The app‐based audio guidance pelvic floor muscle training was more effective and much easier to comply for treatment of stress urinary incontinence in primiparas than the conventional home‐based pelvic floor muscle training.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a mobile health smartphone application to support self‐management programmes on quality of life, self‐management behaviour and exercise and smoking cessation behaviour in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). DESIGN: A randomised controlled, single‐blind trial, was carried out from November 2017 to February 2019, which included 78 participants admitted with COPD to the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University in Guizhou. The study participants were randomised into intervention (n = 39) and control groups (n = 39). METHODS: Participants in the intervention group undertook a mobile medical application‐based programme in addition to routine care, and participants in the control group received only routine care. The outcome measures were health‐related quality of life evaluated by the COPD Assessment‐Test, self‐management behaviour using the COPD Self‐Management Scale and physical activity and smoking behaviour were measured using a self‐designed questionnaire. Data collection was conducted at baseline, third month, sixth month and 12th months. RESULTS: Thirty‐five participants in the intervention group and 33 in the control group completed the study. Compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement in the COPD ‐Assessment ‐Test scores (P < 0.01) and in all domains of the COPD Self‐Management Scale scores (P < 0.01) at 12th 12 months. Improvements in the COPD ‐Assessment ‐Test scores by 4.3 and 0.3 units, and in the total scores of the COPD Self‐Management Scale total score by 23.01 and 2.28 units, respectively, were observed in the intervention and control groups, respectively over the 12‐month study period. Meanwhile, the mobile health application programme also improved participants' exercise and smoking cessation behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The mobile health smartphone application to support self‐management programmes was effective in improving health‐related quality of life and self‐management behaviour in patients with COPD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered in Chinese clinicaltrials.gov.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper reports the results of a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the delivery modality (mobile phone/tablet or fixed computer) of a cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for the treatment of depression. The aim was to establish whether a previously validated computerized program (The Sadness Program) remained efficacious when delivered via a mobile application. METHOD: 35 participants were recruited with Major Depression (80% female) and randomly allocated to access the program using a mobile app (on either a mobile phone or iPad) or a computer. Participants completed 6 lessons, weekly homework assignments, and received weekly email contact from a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist until completion of lesson 2. After lesson 2 email contact was only provided in response to participant request, or in response to a deterioration in psychological distress scores. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ‐9). Of the 35 participants recruited, 68.6% completed 6 lessons and 65.7% completed the 3‐months follow up. Attrition was handled using mixed‐model repeated‐measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Both the Mobile and Computer Groups were associated with statistically significantly benefits in the PHQ‐9 at post‐test. At 3 months follow up, the reduction seen for both groups remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence to indicate that delivering a CBT program using a mobile application, can result in clinically significant improvements in outcomes for patients with depression.

AB  - Background: Tobacco smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide. Digital interventions delivered through smartphones offer a promising alternative to traditional methods, but little is known about their effectiveness. Objective: Our objective was to test the preliminary effectiveness of Quit Genius, a novel digital therapeutic intervention for smoking cessation. Methods: A 2‐arm, single‐blinded, parallel‐group randomized controlled trial design was used. Participants were recruited via referrals from primary care practices and social media advertisements in the United Kingdom. A total of 556 adult smokers (aged 18 years or older) smoking at least 5 cigarettes a day for the past year were recruited. Of these, 530 were included for the final analysis. Participants were randomized to one of 2 interventions. Treatment consisted of a digital therapeutic intervention for smoking cessation consisting of a smartphone app delivering cognitive behavioral therapy content, one‐to‐one coaching, craving tools, and tracking capabilities. The control intervention was very brief advice along the Ask, Advise, Act model. All participants were offered nicotine replacement therapy for 3 months. Participants in a random half of each arm were pseudorandomly assigned a carbon monoxide device for biochemical verification. Outcomes were self‐reported via phone or online. The primary outcome was self‐reported 7‐day point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks post quit date. Results: A total of 556 participants were randomized (treatment: n=277; control: n=279). The intention‐to‐treat analysis included 530 participants (n=265 in each arm; 11 excluded for randomization before trial registration and 15 for protocol violations at baseline visit). By the quit date (an average of 16 days after randomization), 89.1% (236/265) of those in the treatment arm were still actively engaged. At the time of the primary outcome, 74.0% (196/265) of participants were still engaging with the app. At 4 weeks post quit date, 44.5% (118/265) of participants in the treatment arm had not smoked in the preceding 7 days compared with 28.7% (76/265) in the control group (risk ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.23‐1.96; P<.001; intention‐to‐treat, n=530). Self‐reported 7‐day abstinence agreed with carbon monoxide measurement (carbon monoxide <10 ppm) in 96% of cases (80/83) where carbon monoxide readings were available. No harmful effects of the intervention were observed. Conclusions: The Quit Genius digital therapeutic intervention is a superior treatment in achieving smoking cessation 4 weeks post quit date compared with very brief advice.

AB  - Mobile health interventions (i.e., "apps") are used to address mental health and are an increasingly popular method available to both individuals and organizations to manage workplace stress. However, at present, there is a lack of research on the effectiveness of mobile health interventions in counteracting or improving stress-related health problems, particularly in naturalistic, non-clinical settings. This project aimed at validating a mobile health intervention (which is theoretically grounded in the Job Demands-Resources Model) in preventing and managing stress at work. Within the mobile health intervention, employees make an evidence-based, personalized, psycho-educational journey to build further resources, and thus, reduce stress. A large-scale longitudinal randomized control trial, conducted with six European companies over 6 weeks using four measurement points, examined indicators of mental health via measures of stress, wellbeing, resilience, and sleep. The data were analyzed by means of hierarchical multilevel models for repeated measures, including both self-report measures and user behavior metrics from the app. The results (n = 532) suggest that using the mobile health intervention (vs. waitlist control group) significantly improved stress and wellbeing over time. Higher engagement in the intervention increased the beneficial effects. Additionally, use of the sleep tracking function led to an improvement in sleeping troubles. The intervention had no effects on measures of physical health or social community at work. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, focusing on benefits and challenges of using technological solutions for organizations to support individuals' mental health in the workplace.

AB  - This study assessed the efficacy of a virtual reality biofeedback video game (DEEP) in reducing anxiety symptoms. In addition, changes in engagement and cognitive appraisals including self-efficacy, locus of control, and threat-challenge appraisals were measured and it was explored how these factors related to anxiety regulation. Undergraduates with elevated anxiety symptoms (N = 112) were randomly assigned to four training sessions with DEEP or a smartphone-guided breathing application. Trait anxiety was measured at screening, pretest, posttest, and 3 months later. State anxiety was assessed before and after each session. In addition, engagement and appraisals were assessed in each session. Participants in both conditions showed a significant decrease in trait anxiety symptoms from pre- to posttest and this decrease remained stable at follow-up. Furthermore, all participants decreased in state anxiety from pre- to postsession, except for DEEP sessions that included exposure. DEEP users increased in self-efficacy and observed resources to cope throughout the training. In addition, DEEP users felt more engaged in initial sessions than those who used the control application, but their engagement decreased toward the final session. In contrast, participants in the control group showed no change in appraisals nor engagement. Taken together, results demonstrate the potential of digital interventions such as biofeedback games and guided relaxation applications as anxiety regulation tools and show that self-efficacy and threat-challenge appraisals in particular are potential mechanisms of change in biofeedback interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the complexity and chronicity of heart failure, engaging yet simple patient self‐management tools are needed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and patient engagement with a smartphone app designed for heart failure. METHODS: Patients with heart failure were randomized to intervention (smartphone with the Habits Heart App installed and Bluetooth‐linked scale) or control (paper education material) groups. All intervention group patients were interviewed and monitored closely for app feasibility while receiving standard of care heart failure management by cardiologists. The Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test, a quality of life survey (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), and weight were assessed at baseline and final visits. RESULTS: Patients (N=28 patients; intervention: n=15; control: n=13) with heart failure (with reduced ejection fraction: 15/28, 54%; male: 20/28, 71%, female: 8/28, 29%; median age 63 years) were enrolled, and 82% of patients (N=23; intervention: 12/15, 80%; control: 11/13, 85%) completed both baseline and final visits (median follow up 60 days). In the intervention group, 2 out of the 12 patients who completed the study did not use the app after study onboarding due to illnesses and hospitalizations. Of the remaining 10 patients who used the app, 5 patients logged ≥1 interaction with the app per day on average, and 2 patients logged an interaction with the app every other day on average. The intervention group averaged 403 screen views (per patient) in 56 distinct sessions, 5‐minute session durations, and 22 weight entries per patient. There was a direct correlation between duration of app use and improvement in heart failure knowledge (Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test score; ρ=0.59, P=.04) and quality of life (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score; ρ=0.63, P=.03). The correlation between app use and weight change was ρ=‐0.40 (P=.19). Only 1 out of 11 patients in the control group retained education material by the follow‐up visit. CONCLUSIONS: The Habits Heart App with a Bluetooth‐linked scale is a feasible way to engage patients in heart failure management, and barriers to app engagement were identified. A larger multicenter study may be warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of the app. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03238729; http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03238729.

AB  - Background: An Asthma Adherence Pathway (AAP) application, which is an Internet application that combines patient and clinician education strategies to promote adherence to asthma therapy, has been developed. Objective: The primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the AAP application with electronic adherence monitors on asthma control. Secondary objectives evaluated the effect of AAP and monitors on medication adherence, asthma symptoms, quality of life, psychosocial factors, and barriers to treatment. Methods: Adult patients with asthma were randomly assigned either to intervention (n = 19) or control (n = 20) groups in this 3‐month prospective study, and they completed the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). Intervention patients completed the AAP software and were given barrier‐specific motivational interviewing adherence strategies and a SmartTrack device to monitor mometasone furoate/formoterol (MF/F) use. Clinicians in the interventional group received adherence management training. Interventional patients were given feedback regarding adherence findings at each visit. Treatment adherence was determined by the mean of 4 measures of doses taken over 3 months. Control patients were not monitored for MF/F adherence. Results: The mean MF/F adherence in the intervention group was 81%. The intervention and control groups did not differ on the mean baseline ACQ. Thirteen intervention patients achieved the minimal important difference (defined as an improvement ≥0.5 units on the ACQ) compared with 6 control patients (P =.016). The intervention group showed greater improvement in the ACQ (0.75) than the control group (0.19) representing a moderate‐to‐large effect size of d = 0.638. Conclusions: The AAP was effective in promoting adherence and helped to improve asthma control. These findings provide preliminary validation of the AAP model.

AB  - While smartphone usage is ubiquitous, and the app market for smartphone apps targeted at mental health is growing rapidly, the evidence of standalone apps for treating mental health symptoms is still unclear. This meta-analysis investigated the efficacy of standalone smartphone apps for mental health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in February 2018 on randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of standalone apps for mental health in adults with heightened symptom severity, compared to a control group. A random-effects model was employed. When insufficient comparisons were available, data was presented in a narrative synthesis. Outcomes included assessments of mental health disorder symptom severity specifically targeted at by the app. In total, 5945 records were identified and 165 full-text articles were screened for inclusion by two independent researchers. Nineteen trials with 3681 participants were included in the analysis: depression (k = 6), anxiety (k = 4), substance use (k = 5), self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (k = 4), PTSD (k = 2), and sleep problems (k = 2). Effects on depression (Hedges' g = 0.33, 95%CI 0.10-0.57, P = 0.005, NNT = 5.43, I2 = 59%) and on smoking behavior (g = 0.39, 95%CI 0.21-0.57, NNT = 4.59, P ≤ 0.001, I2 = 0%) were significant. No significant pooled effects were found for anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, or alcohol use (g = -0.14 to 0.18). Effect sizes for single trials ranged from g = -0.05 to 0.14 for PTSD and g = 0.72 to 0.84 for insomnia. Although some trials showed potential of apps targeting mental health symptoms, using smartphone apps as standalone psychological interventions cannot be recommended based on the current level of evidence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Burnout is defined as work‐related emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and decreased sense of accomplishment. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an effective treatment modality for various conditions related to anxiety, however, few studies have assessed its role for stress management in residents. We hypothesize that VR‐based mindfulness meditation can reduce resident burnout in real‐world settings. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized crossover trial. METHODS: Resident participants completed the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). One group used a VR‐based meditation app; the second group received no intervention. After a 2‐month rotation, all subjects completed an MBI and crossed over to the other arm. Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests were used to compare MBI scores before and after intervention, and to compare results by gender and postgraduate year. Mann‐Whitney U tests were used to assess qualitative differences between participants. RESULTS: Eighteen residents completed the study. Five participants were female and 13 were male. Weekly use of VR‐guided meditation and paced breathing was associated with a significant decrease in emotional exhaustion (P = .009), and on subgroup analysis, male gender specifically was associated with a decrease in emotional exhaustion (P = .027). In the post‐intervention survey, 42.9% subjects reported that VR encouraged them to employ paced breathing techniques, 71.4% reported that they would use the technology if regularly available, and 21.4% reported they would use paced breathing in the future. CONCLUSION: VR‐based therapy may serve as a successful tool in stress management and reduce the rate of burnout among otolaryngology residents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term conditions and their concomitant management place considerable pressure on patients, communities, and health care systems worldwide. International clinical guidelines on the majority of long-term conditions recommend the inclusion of self-management programs in routine management. Self-management programs have been associated with improved health outcomes; however, the successful and sustainable transfer of research programs into clinical practice has been inconsistent. Recent developments in mobile technology, such as mobile phone and tablet computer apps, could help in developing a platform for the delivery of self-management interventions that are adaptable, of low cost, and easily accessible. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of mobile phone and tablet apps in self-management of key symptoms of long-term conditions. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, EBSCO databases, the Cochrane Library, and The Joanna Briggs Institute Library for randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of mobile phone and tablet apps in self-management of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung diseases from 2005-2016. We searched registers of current and ongoing trials, as well as the gray literature. We then checked the reference lists of all primary studies and review papers for additional references. The last search was run in February 2016. RESULTS: Of the 9 papers we reviewed, 6 of the interventions demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the primary measure of clinical outcome. Where the intervention comprised an app only, 3 studies demonstrated a statistically significant improvement. Interventions to address diabetes mellitus (5/9) were the most common, followed by chronic lung disease (3/9) and cardiovascular disease (1/9). A total of 3 studies included multiple intervention groups using permutations of an intervention involving an app. The duration of the intervention ranged from 6 weeks to 1 year, and final follow-up data ranged from 3 months to 1 year. Sample size ranged from 48 to 288 participants. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence indicates the potential of apps in improving symptom management through self-management interventions. The use of apps in mHealth has the potential to improve health outcomes among those living with chronic diseases through enhanced symptom control. Further innovation, optimization, and rigorous research around the potential of apps in mHealth technology will move the field toward the reality of improved health care delivery and outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laboratory studies suggest that eating more 'attentively' (e.g. attending to food being eaten and recalling eating episodes) can reduce food intake among participants with both healthy weight and overweight. The aim of this trial was to assess whether a smartphone application that encourages a more attentive eating style reduces energy intake and promotes weight loss. METHODS: In an open‐label, single centre, parallel groups, individually randomised controlled trial, 107 adults with overweight/obesity in Merseyside, UK used an attentive eating smartphone application along with standard dietary advice (intervention group) or standard dietary advice only (control group) for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes were change in body weight at 8 weeks and energy intake at 4 and 8 weeks. Additional outcomes included self‐reported eating behaviours measured at 8 weeks. Differences between groups were assessed with linear regression (adjusted) using multiple imputation for missing data. Study protocol registered prospectively at ( https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/btzhw ). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the intervention and control group in weight lost at 8 weeks, or change in self‐reported 24 h or objective taste‐test energy intake at 4 or 8 weeks. Mean weight loss in the intervention group (n = 53) was 1.2 kg and 1.1 kg in the control group (n = 54), adjusted difference of ‐ 0.10 (‐ 1.6 to 1.3) kg. Self‐reported eating behaviours at 8 weeks also did not differ across groups. The intervention was largely used as intended and a per protocol analysis confined to participants in the intervention group that used the attentive eating smartphone application regularly and as intended also showed no effect on energy intake or weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: A smartphone based attentive eating intervention and standard dietary advice did not result in reduced energy intake or greater weight loss at 4 or 8 week follow‐up than standard dietary advice alone.

AB  - - Background Mobile phone‐based smoking cessation support (mCessation) offers the opportunity to provide behavioural support to those who cannot or do not want face‐to‐face support. In addition, mCessation can be automated and therefore provided affordably even in resource‐poor settings. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and previously updated in 2009 and 2012. Objectives To determine whether mobile phone‐based smoking cessation interventions increase smoking cessation rates in people who smoke. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, along with clinicaltrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the most recent searches was 29 October 2018. Selection criteria Participants were smokers of any age. Eligible interventions were those testing any type of predominantly mobile phone‐based programme (such as text messages (or smartphone app) for smoking cessation. We included randomised controlled trials with smoking cessation outcomes reported at at least six‐month follow‐up. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We performed both study eligibility checks and data extraction in duplicate. We performed meta‐analyses of the most stringent measures of abstinence at six months' follow‐up or longer, using a Mantel‐Haenszel random‐effects method, pooling studies with similar interventions and similar comparators to calculate risk ratios (RR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted analyses including all randomised (with dropouts counted as still smoking) and complete cases only. Main results This review includes 26 studies (33,849 participants). Overall, we judged 13 studies to be at low risk of bias, three at high risk, and the remainder at unclear risk. Settings and recruitment procedures varied across studies, but most studies were conducted in high‐income countries. There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency, that automated text messaging interventions were more effective than minimal smoking cessation support (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.00; I 2 = 71%; 13 studies, 14,133 participants). There was also moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, that text messaging added to other smoking cessation interventions was more effective than the other smoking cessation interventions alone (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; I 2 = 0%, 4 studies, 997 participants). Two studies comparing text messaging with other smoking cessation interventions, and three studies comparing high‐ and low‐intensity messaging, did not show significant differences between groups (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.61 to 1.40; I 2 = 27%; 2 studies, 2238 participants; and RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; I 2 = 0%, 3 studies, 12,985 participants, respectively) but confidence intervals were wide in the former comparison. Five studies compared a smoking cessation smartphone app with lower‐intensity smoking cessation support (either a lower‐intensity app or non‐app minimal support). We pooled the evidence and deemed it to be of very low certainty due to inconsistency and serious imprecision. It provided no evidence that smartphone apps improved the likelihood of smoking cessation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; I 2 = 59%; 5 studies, 3079 participants). Other smartphone apps tested differed from the apps included in the analysis, as two used contingency management and one combined text messaging with an app, and so we did not pool them. Using complete case data as opposed to using data from all participants randomised did not substantially alter the findings. Authors' conclusions There is moderate‐certainty evidence that automated text message‐based smoking cessation interventions result in greater quit rates than minimal smoking cessation support. There is moderate‐certainty evidence of the benefit of text messaging interventions in addition to other smoking cessation suppor in comparison with that smoking cessation support alone. The evidence comparing smartphone apps with less intensive support was of very low certainty, and more randomised controlled trials are needed to test these interventions. Plain language summary Can programmes delivered by mobile phones help people to stop smoking? Background Tobacco smoking is a leading cause of preventable death. Mobile phones can be used to support people who want to quit smoking. In this review, we have focused on programmes that use text messages or smartphone apps to do so. Search date We searched for published and unpublished studies in October 2018. Study characteristics We included 26 randomised controlled studies (involving over 33,000 people) that compared smoking quit rates in people who received text messages or smartphone apps to help them quit, with people who did not receive these programmes. We were interested in studies that measured smoking for six months or longer. Key results We found that text messaging programmes may be effective in supporting people to quit, increasing quit rates by 50% to 60%. This was the case when they were compared to minimal support or were tested as an addition to other forms of stop‐smoking support. There was not enough evidence to determine the effect of smartphone apps. Quality and completeness of the evidence Most of the studies were of high quality, although three studies had high drop out rates. We are moderately confident in the results of the text messaging interventions, but there were some issues with unexplained differences between study findings and for some comparisons there was not much data. We have low confidence in the results concerning smartphone apps, and more studies are needed in this field.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are unable to access healthcare services for treatment due to logistical, social, and attitudinal barriers. Interventions delivered via mobile applications (apps) may help overcome these barriers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence from trials investigating the efficacy of mobile apps for treating PTSD. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, and Medline were searched in February 2018. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they quantitatively evaluated the efficacy of a mobile app for treating PTSD as part of the primary aim. Findings were presented in a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: In the five identified RCTs, the use of app-based interventions appeared to be associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms. However, the strength of evidence for this association appeared to be inconsistent, and there was little evidence that those using the apps experienced greater reductions in PTSD symptoms than those in control conditions. Nonetheless, there was some evidence that app-based interventions are both a feasible and acceptable treatment pathway option. CONCLUSIONS: Included studies were often limited by small sample sizes, brief intervention, and follow-up periods, and self-reported measures of PTSD. Evidence for the efficacy of mobile interventions for treating PTSD was inconclusive, but promising. Healthcare professionals should exercise caution in recommending app-based interventions until the potentially adverse effects of app use are better understood and larger-scale studies have taken place.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study aim was to examine the mechanisms of physical activity behaviour change in the multi‐component eCoFit randomised controlled trial (RCT) among adults diagnosed with, or at risk of, T2D. METHOD: The RCT included two phases: phase 1 (weeks 1‐10) integrated group sessions (outdoor physical activity and cognitive mentoring) and the use of the eCoFit smartphone application (app), and phase 2 (weeks 11‐20), which included the use of the eCoFit smartphone application only. Participants (n = 84) were assessed at baseline and 10 and 20 weeks from baseline. Physical activity was assessed using pedometers, and the following mediators were tested: action self‐efficacy, barrier self‐efficacy, recovery self‐efficacy, implementation intentions, intention to have regular physical activity, outcome expectations, risk perception and implicit associations related to physical activity. The PROCESS INDIRECT Macro was used to perform mediation analyses. RESULTS: Significant mediation pathways were found for implementation intention measured at 10 weeks, AB (95% CI = 486.04 [128.19, 1073.42]). No significant pathways were found for the other social‐cognitive and implicit attitudinal mediators. CONCLUSION: Increased daily steps among the intervention participants were explained by increased implementation intentions. The eCoFit study successfully operationalised implementation intentions in the smartphone app designed to promote outdoor physical activity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was approved by a University Human Research Committee and is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12615000990527).

AB  - Participation in regular physical activity has significant physical, psychological, and social benefits, including the prevention and treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The primary aim of this paper was to evaluate the impact of theeCoFit physical activity intervention on depression and anxiety symptoms among adults at risk of, or diagnosed with, T2D. The primary outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire‐9, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder‐7. The secondary aim was to test for the potential mediators for the intervention effect on mental health. The 20‐week intervention was evaluated using a two‐arm randomised controlled trial with await list control group. The intervention included two phases: Phase 1 integrated group face‐to‐face sessions and the use of the eCoFit smartphone application (app); and Phase 2 that included the use of the app only. Participants (n = 84) were assessed at baseline and 10‐ and 20‐weeks post‐baseline. Social support, self‐efficacy, nature‐relatedness, and perceived sleep quality were examined as potential mechanisms for the intervention effects on mental health. A significant interaction for depression severity was observed at 20‐weeks (‐1.76, CI ‐3.48, ‐05, p= .044, d= ‐0.35). There were no significant intervention effects for anxiety or any of the potential mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional status is an important prognostic factor in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). We wished to study the safety, tolerability and efficacy of nutritional counseling with or without an mHealth application to maintain or increase body weight in ALS, compared to standard care. // METHODS: In this randomized open‐label, standard‐of‐care‐controlled, single‐center clinical trial, we randomly assigned adults with ALS to one of three nutritional interventions: counseling by their physician or nurse ("standard care"), counseling by a registered dietitian (RD) ("in‐person"), or counseling supported by a mHealth app ("mHealth"). Both intervention arms received tailored nutrition recommendations and recorded dietary intake and weight biweekly (mHealth) or monthly (in‐person). The primary outcome of weight and secondary and tertiary outcomes of calorie intake, ALSFRS‐R, and quality of life (QOL) were recorded at each clinic visit and analyzed in an ITT mixed model analysis. // RESULTS: A total of 88 participants were enrolled of whom 78 were included in this analysis. The three arms were well‐balanced except for excess males in the mHealth arm and greater weight lost at baseline in the in‐person arm. Participants in the mHealth arm increased their calorie intake at month 3 to an average of 94% (95% CI: 85, 103) of recommended calories, compared to 81% (95% CI: 72, 91, p = 0.06 vs. mHealth) in the standard care arm. After 6 months, calorie intake was not different among the three arms. Overall weight was stable across all three groups. QOL scores in the mHealth arm were stable over 3 months (0.3 points, 95% CI: ‐ 1.7, 2.2) compared to worsening in standard care (‐ 2.1 points, 95% CI: ‐ 4.0, ‐ 0.2, p = 0.09 vs. mHealth), but all scores declined by 6 months. ALSFRS‐R total scores declined by an average of ‐ 2.6 points (95% CI: ‐ 5.1, ‐ 0.1) over 6 months in the mHealth arm (p = 0.13 vs. standard care) compared to ‐ 5.8 points (95% CI: ‐ 8.2, ‐ 3.4, p = 0.74 vs. standard care) in the in‐person and ‐ 5.2 points (95% CI: ‐ 7.6, ‐ 2.9) in the standard care arm. // CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional counseling by a registered dietitian (with or without support by an mHealth app) is safe but did not maintain weight significantly better than standard care in ALS patients. // TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ identifier NCT02418546.

AB  - Nearly all college student smokers also drink alcohol, and smoking and heavy episodic drinking (HED) commonly co‐occur. However, few studies have examined the factors that concurrently influence smoking and HED among college students and, to date, no interventions have been developed that target both HED and smoking in this population. The objective of the current study was to develop and evaluate a mobile feedback intervention that targets HED and smoking. Participants (N = 94) were non‐treatment‐seeking college students (M(age) = 20.5 years, SD = 1.7) who engaged in at least a single HED episode in the past 2 weeks and reported concurrent smoking and drinking at least once a week. Participants were randomized to receive either the mobile intervention for 14 days, complete mobile assessments (without intervention) for 14 days, or complete minimal assessments (without intervention or mobile assessments). At a 1‐month follow‐up, compared with the minimal assessment condition, we observed significant reductions in the number of cigarettes per smoking day in both the mobile intervention (d = 0.55) and mobile assessment (d = 0.45) conditions. Among those randomized to the mobile intervention, receiving more modules of the intervention was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of any drinking during the 14‐day assessment period and significant reductions in smoking at 1‐month follow‐up. The mobile intervention did not result in significant reductions in HED or concurrent smoking and drinking. Future research should continue to examine ways of using technology and the real‐time environment to improve interventions for HED and smoking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients are discharged with aspirin (ASA) as an anticoagulant after joint replacement surgery. In studies in which ASA was prescribed, doses were frequently missed. Adherence to postoperative ASA regimen is critical to preventing thrombotic complications. This randomized controlled study evaluated the impact of an existing medication adherence smartphone application (app) on adherence to twice daily ASA 81 mg for 35 days after knee or hip arthroplasty. METHODOLOGY: Patients were randomized to either the app (intervention) group or the usual care (control) group. All patients received a baseline interview with a survey and demographics collected prior to randomization, a 36‐day follow‐up call for phone pill count, and a 6‐week in‐office interview with surveys and an in‐person pill count. A convenience sample of 195 patients enrolled; 122 completed pill counts at both baseline and end of study. Ages ranged from 29 to 89 (mean: 60.4, SD: 10.1) years. The majority had a bachelor's degree or higher (59.3%), made more than $75,000 (or were retired; 51.9%), were of White race (75.9%), and female (53.8%). There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences in final pill counts, adherence (reasons for missed pills), or ASA Medication self‐efficacy scores. However, the intervention group scored significantly higher on the ASA Adherence measure (general ease in and ability to take ASA; p = .020). Higher ASA Adherence scores were associated with lower pill counts at the end of study (better adherence) in the intervention group. There was a high rate of attrition related to failure to bring the ASA to hospital or to the follow‐up appointment. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no significant differences in final pill counts between groups, the app group reported more ease in taking pills. With smartphone use virtually ubiquitous, this project provided an opportunity to educate patients and nurses about how technology can support medication adherence. It was also an excellent opportunity to involve clinical nurses in a funded research project.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to examine the preliminary effect, feasibility, and acceptability of a lifestyle intervention program using a mobile application (app) versus the effect of a program using a booklet for adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Patients and Methods: This trial was conducted in two community centers of Hong Kong. Participants were included if they were adults with MetS, aged over 50, and able to use a smartphone. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to either the app group or booklet group. Those in the booklet group received a health talk and a booklet, whereas those in the app group received a health talk and a MetS app to support their exercise maintenance and health records for 3 months. Both groups received similar educational content related to healthcare for MetS clients. Data were collected at baseline (T1) and at 1‐(T2) and 3‐month (T3) intervals. Outcomes were body weight (primary outcome), total amount of exercise, blood pressure, and lipid concentrations. Data were analyzed using the generalized estimat‐ing equation models. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed in process evaluation. Results: Ninety‐eight individuals were screened for eligibility and 77 were randomized into the app group (n = 38) or booklet group (n = 39). The attrition rate at T3 was 11.690%. The app group showed a significant reduction in body weight (β = −1.069, p = 0.012) and body mass index (β = −0.371, p = 0.026), a greater amount of exercise (β = 8.454, p = 0.032), and improved exercise self‐efficacy (β = 10.62, p = 0.001) within 3 months. There were no significant differences between groups for other outcomes. The participants appreciated the proposed intervention of the programme. Conclusion: The MetS app may be incorporated in the health promotion programme to support exercise maintenance and a healthy lifestyle in the community.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of education using avatars for improving patients' heart failure knowledge and self‐care. BACKGROUND: A lack of knowledge and self‐care contributes to poor outcomes and rehospitalization for people with heart failure. DESIGN: A multi‐centred, non‐blinded pragmatic randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Heart failure patients were randomly assigned to intervention (avatar education application) or usual care groups. Participants were followed up at baseline, 30 and 90 days. ANCOVA was used to compare the scores of heart failure knowledge and self‐care, between the two groups. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the two groups' heart failure‐cause readmission. Bivariate exact binary logistic regression was used to identify the predictors associated with baseline levels of knowledge. RESULTS: A total of 36 participants were recruited (between October 2018 ‐ March 2019). The mean age of participants was 67.5 (SD 11.3) years. At enrolment, approximately half (47.2%) have been living with Heart Failure for over 5 years. Two groups were comparable at baseline in their demographic and clinical characteristics. At 90 days, the intervention group participants had a higher increase in knowledge score on the Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge Scales compared with the control group (22.2% versus 3.7% P = .002, partial η2 = 0.262, 95% CI ‐2.755 to ‐0.686). There was no between‐group difference observed at 30‐ or 90‐day follow‐up, on self‐care behaviour (Self‐care of heart failure index) or healthcare use. Overall satisfaction with the avatar app was 91.3%. CONCLUSION: The addition of a co‐designed avatar app to usual care improved knowledge in our group of Heart Failure participants at 30 days and continued to increase up to 90 days. The results suggest that our avatar app was perceived as an enjoyable and engaging means of delivering critical knowledge and self‐care information. IMPACT: Heart failure is associated with poor clinical outcomes (i.e., readmission rates and mortality rate) and substantial economic burden. The effectiveness of Heart Failure patient education using avatar have not been investigated previously. In this study, the avatar app improved knowledge and self‐care behaviours. This innovation could be used at the bedside, at home by nurses, patients and families.

AB  - Background: Respiratory exacerbations impair lung function and health‐related quality of life in people with CF, with delayed identification of exacerbations often resulting in worse outcomes. We developed a smartphone application (app) for adults with CF to report symptoms to the CF team, and investigated its impact on antibiotic use and other outcomes. Methods: Participants were randomised to intervention (use of the app weekly or sooner if symptoms had worsened) or control (usual care). The app comprised questions relating to symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation. If worsening symptoms were reported, the participant was contacted by the nurse practitioner. The primary outcome measure was the number of courses and days of intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Results: Sixty participants (29 female, aged [mean Â± SD] 31 Â± 9 years, FEV1 60 Â± 18% predicted) were recruited, with 29 (48%) allocated to the intervention group. Over the 12‐month follow‐up, there was no clear effect of the app on the number of courses of IV antibiotics (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6 to 1.7), however number of courses of oral antibiotics increased (IRR 1.5; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.2). The median [IQR] time to detection of exacerbation requiring oral or IV antibiotics was shorter in the intervention group compared with the control group (70 [123] vs. 141 [140] days; p = .02). No between‐group differences were observed in other outcomes. Conclusion: The use of an app reduced time to detect respiratory exacerbations that required antibiotics, however did not demonstrate a clear effect on the number of courses of IV antibiotics.

AB  - Alcohol use is a key risk factor for HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM). Past studies show that brief motivational interventions (BMI) can increase the use of prevention methods (e.g., condoms), reduce alcohol use, and can be adapted for web‐based delivery. However, few studies have explored these interventions' effects in MSM. Forty high‐risk, heavy drinking MSM who sought rapid HIV testing were randomly assigned to receive either (1) standard post‐test counseling (SPC) alone, or (2) SPC plus Game Plan (GP), a tablet tablet‐based BMI for alcohol use and HIV risk. Over three months of follow‐up, GP participants reported 24% fewer heavy drinking days, 17% fewer alcohol problems, and 50% fewer new anal sex partners than controls. GP participants also reported fewer high‐risk condomless anal sex events than controls, but these differences were not significant. These initial results suggest that web‐based BMIs may be promising tools to help MSM reduce health risk behaviors.

AB  - Smart technology (ST) can enhance chronic disease management, yet little is known about the benefits of ST on kidney stone prevention. Our aim was to prospectively evaluate the impact of ST on follow‐up adherence rates and urine output (UOP) in patients with nephrolithiasis. Kidney stone patients with low UOP (< 2.5 L/24 h) were randomized into three intervention groups: (1) standard dietary/medical counseling alone (control), (2) control + smartphone fluid management application (app), and (3) control + smart water bottle (bottle). Demographics, adherence rates, kidney stone events, and 24 h urine data were collected and analyzed at baseline, 3–6, and 12 months. We randomized 111 patients (37 per group), of which 20 (55%), 8 (26%), and 10 (33%) patients completed the 12 month follow‐up in the control, app, and bottle groups respectively. Control group patients were the most likely to adhere to follow‐up (p = 0.004). Overall mean UOP increased by 0.4 L in each group (p < 0.05), with no difference in mean baseline 24 h UOP (1.6 L) and 12 month 24 h UOP (2.0 L) between groups (p > 0.05). Twenty‐nine percent of patients achieved a daily UOP goal of > 2.5 L across the treatment groups (p < 0.001). In this prospective study, the 24 h UOP improved across all groups compared to baseline, although adherence to follow‐up remained low. Furthermore, the use of ST did not further augment UOP, underscoring the importance of dietary/medical counseling for kidney stone prevention.

AB  - Patient education and behavioural interventions for self-management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are effective but place demands on manpower resources. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effectiveness of smartphone technologies (STs) for improving glycaemic control among T2DM patients. CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and ScienceDirect were searched through December 2016. Randomized controlled trials comparing STs with usual diabetes care among T2DM patients and reporting change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level were included. Seventeen trials (2,225 participants) were included. There was a significant reduction in HbA1c (pooled weighted mean difference: -0.51%; 95% confidence interval: -0.71% to -0.30%; p < 0.001), favouring ST intervention. The pooled weighted mean difference was -0.83% in patients with T2DM <8.5 years and -0.22% in patients with T2DM >=8.5 years, with significant subgroup difference (p = 0.007). No subgroup differences were found among different follow-up durations, trial locations, patients' age, healthcare provider contract time, baseline body mass index and baseline HbA1c. Compared with usual diabetes care, STs improved glycaemic control among T2DM patients, especially for patients at earlier disease stages (duration of diagnosis <8.5 years). STs could be a complement or alternative to labour-intensive patient education and behavioural interventions, but more studies on up-to-date technologies are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes and related complications are estimated to cost US $727 billion worldwide annually. Type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes are three subtypes of diabetes that share the same behavioral risk factors. Efforts in lifestyle modification, such as daily physical activity and healthy diets, can reduce the risk of prediabetes, improve the health levels of people with diabetes, and prevent complications. Lifestyle modification is commonly performed in a face-to-face interaction, which can prove costly. Mobile phone apps provide a more accessible platform for lifestyle modification in diabetes. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to summarize and synthesize the clinical evidence of the efficacy of mobile phone apps for lifestyle modification in different subtypes of diabetes. METHODS: In June 2018, we conducted a literature search in 5 databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO). We evaluated the studies that passed screening using The Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool. We conducted a meta-analysis for each subtype on the mean difference (between intervention and control groups) at the posttreatment glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level. Where possible, we analyzed subgroups for short-term (3-6 months) and long-term (9-12 months) studies. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: We identified total of 2669 articles through database searching. After the screening, we included 26 articles (23 studies) in the systematic review, of which 18 studies (5 type 1 diabetes, 11 type 2 diabetes, and 2 prediabetes studies) were eligible for meta-analysis. For type 1 diabetes, the overall effect on HbA1c was statistically insignificant (P=.46) with acceptable heterogeneity (I2=39%) in the short-term subgroup (4 studies) and significant heterogeneity between the short-term and long-term subgroups (I2=64%). Regarding type 2 diabetes, the overall effect on HbA1c was statistically significant (P<.01) in both subgroups, and when the 2 subgroups were combined, there was virtually no heterogeneity within and between the subgroups (I2 range 0%-2%). The effect remained statistically significant (P<.01) after adjusting for publication bias using the trim and fill method. For the prediabetes condition, the overall effect on HbA1c was statistically insignificant (P=.67) with a large heterogeneity (I2=65%) between the 2 studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence for the efficacy of mobile phone apps for lifestyle modification in type 2 diabetes. The evidence is inconclusive for the other diabetes subtypes.

AB  - Meta-analyses have shown that digital mental health apps can be efficacious in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, real-world usage of apps is typically not sustained over time, and no studies systematically examine which features increase sustained engagement with apps or the relationship between engagement features and clinical efficacy. We conducted a systematic search of the literature to identify empirical studies that (1) investigate standalone apps for depression and/or anxiety in symptomatic participants and (2) report at least one measure of engagement. Features intended to increase engagement were categorized using the persuasive system design (PSD) framework and principles of behavioral economics. Twenty-five studies with 4159 participants were included in the analysis. PSD features were commonly used, whereas behavioral economics techniques were not. Smartphone apps were efficacious in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in randomized controlled trials, with overall small-to-medium effects (g = 0.2888, SE = 0.0999, z(15) = 2.89, p = 0.0119, Q(df = 14) = 41.93, p < 0.0001, I2 = 66.6%), and apps that employed a greater number of engagement features as compared to the control condition had larger effect sizes (β = 0.0450, SE = 0.0164, t(15) = 2.7344, p = 0.0161). We observed an unexpected negative association between PSD features and engagement, as measured by completion rate (β = -0.0293, SE = 0.0121, t(17) = 02.4142, p = 0.0281). Overall, PSD features show promise for augmenting app efficacy, though engagement, as reflected in study completion, may not be the primary factor driving this association. The results suggest that expanding the use of PSD features in mental health apps may increase clinical benefits and that other techniques, such as those informed by behavioral economics, are employed infrequently.

AB  - With the introduction of deepfake technology, which enables digital face‐swapping between two individuals, young women are no longer passive viewers of attractive celebrities, but are able to become part of the perfect images. This study used the ZAO app as the apparatus to investigate the impact of viewing the self‐celebrity deepfaked videos (SCDV) on young female users' appearance self‐evaluation (i.e., body image and state appearance self‐esteem). A sample of 128 young women 18‐31 years of age was randomly assigned to view either 10 SCDV or 10 purely celebrity videos (PCV). All videos were sourced from the ZAO app. Results showed that participants in the SCDV condition perceived themselves as more physically attractive, experienced greater satisfaction with their own facial features, and reported marginally higher state appearance self‐esteem than those in the PCV condition, whereas body shape satisfaction did not differ between the conditions. In addition, SCDV exposure increased perceived overall physical attractiveness and facial features satisfaction, but did not impact body shape satisfaction, whereas PCV exposure decreased facial features satisfaction, but did not impact perceived overall physical attractiveness or body shape satisfaction. "Attractive possible self" (APS) perception positively mediated the effect of SCDV exposure on perceived overall physical attractiveness, facial features satisfaction, body shape satisfaction, and state appearance self‐esteem, while state appearance comparison only negatively mediated the effect of SCDV exposure on facial features satisfaction. This study reveals the potential of deepfake technology as an intervention technique for body image disturbances.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite of the established effectiveness, the acceptance and adherence of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) remains sub-optimal. Mobile technologies are increasingly used in promoting CR without any firm evidence of their safety and efficacy. This systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed to assess the effect of mobile applications as an intervention for improving adherence to CR. METHODS: Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase and Web of Science from inception to 29th December 2018. Eligible studies were the ones which used mobile applications as a stand-alone intervention or as the primary component for the intervention directed at improving CR adherence, without any limitations on outpatient or home-based CR. RESULTS: Eight studies were eligible for the systematic review including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as well as four before-after studies of which only one had control group. Four RCTs and 185 patients in experimental group were included in meta-analysis, which had evaluated the effect of mobile health applications on CR completion and had reported that the adherence of patients using mobile applications was 1.4 times higher than the control group (RR = 1.38; CI 1.16 to 1.65; P = 0.0003). Moreover, we also found mixed results in exercise capacity, mental health and quality of life. CONCLUSION: The use of mobile applications for improving the adherence of the CR might be effective. However, it appears to be in the initial stage of implementing mobile applications in CR and more research is essential to validate their effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of premature death. People with hypertension who do not comply with recommended treatment strategies have a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, leading to hospitalization and consequently greater health care costs. The smartphone, which is now ubiquitous, offers a convenient tool to aid in the treatment of hypertension through the use of apps targeting lifestyle management, and such app-based interventions have shown promising results. In particular, recent evidence has shown the feasibility, acceptability, and success of digital interventions in changing the behavior of people with chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically compile available evidence to determine the overall effect of smartphone apps on blood pressure control, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes for people with hypertension. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials related to the influence of an app-based intervention in people with hypertension. Data extracted from the included studies were subjected to a meta-analysis to compare the effects of the smartphone app intervention to a control. RESULTS: Eight studies with a total of 1657 participants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis of 6 studies assessing systolic blood pressure showed a significant overall effect in favor of the smartphone intervention (weighted mean difference -2.28, 95% CI -3.90-0.66). Pooled analysis of studies assessing medication adherence demonstrated a significant effect (P<.001) in favor of the intervention group (standard mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.26-0.50) with low heterogeneity (I2=0%). No difference between groups was demonstrated with respect to physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: A smartphone intervention leads to a reduction in blood pressure and an increase in medication adherence for people with hypertension. Future research should focus on the effect of behavior coaching apps on medication adherence, lifestyle change, and blood pressure reduction.

AB  - Objective: High‐occupational stress among ED staff has a detrimental impact on both staff wellness and patient care. The objective of the study is to determine whether 4 weeks of smartphone app‐guided mindfulness practice reduces stress levels of ED staff. Methods: This two‐arm randomised controlled trial was conducted in two Australian EDs in 2019–2020. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either an App group or a Wait to Treat group to practice daily 10 min app‐guided mindfulness for 4 weeks. Online surveys were collected for both groups at three time periods: before (T1), immediately after (T2) and 3 months after cessation (T3). Then the Wait to Treat group received the same intervention, followed by surveys immediately after the intervention (T4) and 3 months later (T5). Primary outcome was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (three subscales: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment), Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale and Warwick‐Edinburgh Mental Well‐being Scale. Both intention‐to‐treat and per‐protocol analysis were performed. Repeated measurement data were analysed by the linear mixed model. Results: Of 148 enrolled participants 98 completed all the surveys, but only half (48%) reported continuous use of the app. Based on the results of the intention‐to‐treat analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement of perceived stress levels (F = 15.70, P < 0.001), all three components of burnout (emotional exhaustion [F = 14.22, P < 0.001], depersonalisation [F = 3.62, P = 0.030], personal accomplishment [F = 7.51, P < 0.001]), mindfulness (F = 8.83, P < 0.001) and wellbeing levels (F = 10.71, P < 0.001) from pre‐intervention to 3 months later with small effect sizes. Conclusion: Results of the present study demonstrate that brief mindfulness training via innovative digital technology had a small positive effect in improving emergency staff stress, burnout, mindfulness and wellbeing.

AB  - Background: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) refers to the spectrum of clinical presentation of coronary artery disease (CAD). As a routine practice at our institute, following PCI, ACS patients are called for the first follow up after two weeks. This period of two weeks can be full of anxieties, concerns and medical issues. In this study, we planned to assess the feasibility/acceptability of smart phone application (app) based system for patient follow‐up and its comparison to routine practice among patients with ACS who have undergone a PCI. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted over a period of one year from January to December 2017. After the PCI was deemed successful, patients were recruited and enrolled based on the understanding of basic English language and operation of a smart phone. Those who consented to be part of study were then randomly allocated either the conventional follow up group or the intense follow up (routine + smart phone app based follow up) group. First co‐ primary outcome was composite of clinical outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, target vessel revascularisation, heart failure admission and emergency visit). Second co‐ primary outcome was patient satisfaction. The overall patient satisfaction was assessed by the patients using a five‐point patient satisfaction survey instrument containing five questions with 5 marks each, in which higher scores meant more satisfaction. Secondary outcome was controlled hypertension in hypertensive patients. It was defined as systolic BP less than 130 and diastolic BP less than 80 mmHg. Results: A cohort of 228 patients (109 in intense app‐based arm; 119 in routine follow up arm) were analyzed. The result showed significant improvement in blood pressure control in hypertensive population in intense app based follow up group (76.2%) when compared to routine follow up group (45%) with p value 0.0062. The satisfaction score was significantly higher in the intense app based follow up (20.7 ± 1.29) as compared to routine follow up (16.5 ± 2.68); p value 0.0001. In the intense app based follow up 72.5% patient felt it was excellent tool (score 21–25) while 27.5% categorized it as good (score 16–20). While the routine follows up was perceived as good by most (91.6%) of the patients. Only 4.2% graded it as excellent and an equal number (4.2%) graded it as a poor way of follow up. Conclusions: App based system shows higher satisfaction rate and comparable clinical outcome when compared to traditional hospital based follow up protocol alone. It has a high acceptance rate and thus this system should be explored further to optimize long term patient care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the self‐monitoring interventions of a mobile health app reduce sedentary behavior in the short and long terms. METHOD: We designed a double‐blind randomized control trial. Participants were selected from among the staff of a medical institution and registrants of an online research firm. Forty‐nine participants were randomly assigned to either a control group (n = 25) or an intervention group (n = 24). The control group was given only the latest information about sedentary behavior, and the intervention was provided real‐time feedback for self‐monitoring in addition to the information. These interventions provided for 5 weeks (to measure the short‐term effect) and 13 weeks (to measure the long‐term effect) via the smartphone app. Measurements were as follows: subjective total sedentary time (SST), objective total sedentary time (OST), mean sedentary bout duration (MSB), and the number of sedentary breaks (SB). Only SST was measured by self‐report based on the standardized International Physical Activity Questionnaire and others were measured with the smartphone. RESULTS: No significant results were observed in the short term. In the long term, while no significant results were also observed in objective sedentary behavior (OST, MSB, SB), the significant differences were observed in subjective sedentary behavior (SST, βint ‐ βctrl between baseline and 9/13 weeks; 1.73 and 1.50 h/d, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Real‐time feedback for self‐monitoring with smartphone did not significantly affect objective sedentary behavior. However, providing only information about sedentary behavior to users with smartphones may make misperception on the amount of their subjective sedentary behavior.

AB  - PURPOSE: Medical students have higher rates of depression and psychologic distress than the general population, which may negatively impact academic performance and professional conduct. This study assessed whether 10‐20 min of daily mindfulness meditation for 30 days, using a mobile phone application, could decrease perceived stress and improve well‐being for medical students. METHODS: Eighty‐eight medical students were stratified by class year and randomized to either intervention or control groups to use the mobile application Headspace, an audio‐guided mindfulness meditation program, for 30 days. All participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Five‐Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and General Well‐Being Schedule (GWBS) at baseline (T1), 30 days (T2), and 60 days (T3). Repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) was conducted for intervention versus control groups across T1, T2, and T3 to examine differences in stress, mindfulness, and well‐being. RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between time and treatment group for perceived stress and well‐being. Perceived stress significantly decreased for the intervention group from T1 to T3 (F[2,142] = 3.98, p < 0.05). General well‐being significantly increased for the intervention group compared to the control group from T1 to T2, and the increase was sustained through T3 (F[2,144] = 3.36, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight that a mobile audio‐guided mindfulness meditation program is an effective means to decrease perceived stress in medical students, which may have implications on patient care. Integrating mindfulness training into medical school curricula for management of school‐ and work‐related stress may lead to fewer negative physician outcomes (e.g., burnout, anxiety, and depression) and improved physician and patient outcomes. This has implications for a broad group of therapists and healthcare providers, ultimately improving quality of healing and patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health applications are increasingly used in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) to improve their self-management, nonetheless, without firm evidence of their efficacy. This meta-analysis was aimed to assess the efficacy of mobile health applications in supporting self-management as an intervention to reduce hospital admission rates and average days of hospitalization, etc. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science (SCI), Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched for relevant articles published before November 14th, 2017. A total of 6 reports with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were finally included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: Patients using mobile phone applications may have a lower risk for hospital admissions than those in the usual care group (risk ratio (RR) = 0.73, 95% CI [0.52, 1.04]). However, there was no significant difference in reducing the average days of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Self-management with mobile phone applications could reduce hospital admissions of patients with COPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of cancer pain increases in discharged patients because of discontinued standard treatments and reductions in medication adherence. Motivated by the need for better pain management in discharged patients, we developed a mobile phone app (Pain Guard) to provide continuous treatment information and feedback to discharged cancer patients suffering from pain. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to design, construct, and test the Pain Guard app in patients managing cancer pain, evaluate the total remission rate of pain and the improvement in quality of life (QoL) to improve pain management for cancer pain patients, and assess patient acceptance of the app. METHODS: This randomized controlled double‐arm study involved 58 patients with cancer pain symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to a group receiving care through the Pain Guard app (n=31) or to a control group (n=27) who received only traditional pharmaceutical care. In a pretest, participants were rated using a baseline cancer pain assessment and QoL evaluation. During treatment, the consumption levels of analgesic drugs were recorded every week. After a 4‐week study period, another round of cancer pain assessment and QoL evaluation was conducted. The system's usability, feasibility, app compliance, and satisfaction were also assessed. Our primary outcome was remission rate of pain, and secondary outcomes were medication adherence, improvements in QoL, frequency of breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP), incidence of adverse reactions, and satisfaction of patients. RESULTS: All participants (N=58) successfully completed the study. There were no significant differences in baseline pain scores or baseline QoL scores between groups. At the end of the study, the rate of pain remission in the trial group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<.001). The frequency of BTcP in the app group was considerably lower than that in the control group (P<.001). The rate of medication adherence in the trial group was considerably higher than that in the control group (P<.001). Improvements in global QoL scores in the trial group were also significantly higher than those in the control group (P<.001). The incidence of adverse reactions in the trial group (7/31) was lower than that in the control group (12/27), especially constipation, with significant differences (P=.01). The 31 participants in the trial group completed a satisfaction survey regarding Pain Guard: 23 (74%) indicated that they were satisfied with receiving pharmaceutical care by Pain Guard, 5 (16%) indicated that they were somewhat satisfied, 2 (6%) indicated neutral feelings, and 1 (3%) indicated that they were somewhat dissatisfied; no participants indicated that they were very dissatisfied. CONCLUSIONS: Pain Guard was effective for the management of pain in discharged patients with cancer pain, and its operability was effective and easily accepted by patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High sedentary time, low physical activity (PA), and low physical fitness place older adults at increased risk of chronic diseases, functional decline, and premature mortality. Mobile health (mHealth) apps, apps that run on mobile platforms, may help promote active living. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the effect of mHealth app interventions on sedentary time, PA, and fitness in older adults. METHODS: We systematically searched five electronic databases for trials investigating the effects of mHealth app interventions on sedentary time, PA, and fitness among community-dwelling older adults aged 55 years and older. We calculated pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) in these outcomes between the intervention and control groups after the intervention period. We performed a Cochrane risk of bias assessment and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation certainty assessment. RESULTS: Overall, six trials (486 participants, 66.7% [324/486] women; age mean 68 [SD 6] years) were included (five of these trials were included in the meta-analysis). mHealth app interventions may be associated with decreases in sedentary time (SMD=-0.49; 95% CI -1.02 to 0.03), increases in PA (506 steps/day; 95% CI -80 to 1092), and increases in fitness (SMD=0.31; 95% CI -0.09 to 0.70) in trials of 3 months or shorter and with increases in PA (753 steps/day; 95% CI -147 to 1652) in trials of 6 months or longer. Risk of bias was low for all but one study. The quality of evidence was moderate for PA and sedentary time and low for fitness. CONCLUSIONS: mHealth app interventions have the potential to promote changes in sedentary time and PA over the short term, but the results did not achieve statistical significance, possibly because studies were underpowered by small participant numbers. We highlight a need for larger trials with longer follow-up to clarify if apps deliver sustained clinically important effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: SMART‐GDM examined whether Habits‐GDM, a smartphone application (app) coaching program, can prevent excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) and improve glycemic control and maternal and neonatal outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, women diagnosed with GDM between 12 and 30 weeks were randomly assigned to usual care (control) or to additional support from Habits‐GDM that integrated dietary, physical activity, weight, and glucose monitoring (intervention). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with EGWG. Secondary outcomes included absolute gestational weight gain (GWG), glycemic control, and maternal, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 340 women were randomized (170 intervention, 170 control; mean ± SD age 32.0 ± 4.2 years; mean BMI 25.6 ± 5.6 kg/m2). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of women with EGWG, absolute GWG, or maternal and delivery outcomes between experimental groups. Average glucose readings were lower in the intervention group (mean difference ‐0.15 mmol/L [95% CI ‐0.26; ‐0.03], P = 0.011) as were the proportions of glucose above targets (premeal: 17.9% vs. 23.3%, odds ratio 0.68 [95% CI 0.53; 0.87], P = 0.003; 2‐h postmeal: 19.9% vs. 50%, 0.54 [0.42; 0.70], P < 0.001). When regarded as a composite (although not prespecified), the overall neonatal complications (including birth trauma, neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and perinatal death) were significantly lower in the intervention group (38.1% vs. 53.7%, 0.53 [0.34; 0.84], P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: When added to usual care, Habits‐GDM resulted in better maternal glycemic control and composite neonatal outcomes (nonprespecified) but did not reduce EGWG among women with GDM.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness and self-compassion training delivered through a mobile application in enhancing well-being and reducing psychological distress. A total of 2,282 participants participated in this study and they were randomly assigned to one of the three 4-week training conditions, namely mobile mindfulness-based training (mMBT), mobile self-compassion based training (mSCT), and mobile cognitive behavioral training (mCBT) as an active comparison group. Mental well-being, peace of mind, and psychological distress were measured at baseline, post-intervention and 3-month follow-up. Among these participants, 508 and 349 completed post- and 3-month follow-up assessment, respectively. Missing data were imputed based on maximum likelihood estimation. Results showed that both mMBT and mSCT were as efficacious as the well-established mCBT in improving well-being, enhancing a sense of peace of mind, and reducing psychological distress. Based on the results from mediation analyses, self-compassion and non-attachment were found to be the mechanisms of change shared by all the three conditions in predicting improvement in outcomes. Results indicated that these were common processes of changes regardless which interventions were used. This study also explored the moderating effects of self-criticism, discomfort with emotion, and tolerance for ambiguity in affecting outcomes across the three conditions. However, results showed that there was no significant interaction effect between conditions and moderators, indicating that they could not predict treatment effectiveness of the three trainings. All the three trainings appeared to be effective in enhancing well-being and peace of mind, reducing psychological well-being in similar degree, regardless of participants' individual characteristics before the training. Despite the limitations of this study that precluded strong conclusions based on the mediation and moderation analysis, such as high attrition rate, absence of control or comparison condition, and lack of interim assessment to evaluate temporal precedence, this study highlighted the efficacy of using mobile application-based psychological training in promoting well-being.

AB  - AIMS/INTRODUCTION: There is potential for mobile applications to deliver new self‐management interventions for chronic disease, especially in diabetes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of a mobile phone application (MPA) combined with or without self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) on glycemic control in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a 24‐week period, four‐arm parallel group, non‐blinded, randomized trial. A total of 185 patients with mean age of 52 years were randomized to group A (no MPA and no SMBG), group B (SMBG only), group C (MPA only) and group D (both MPA and SMBG were used). Changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose and 1,5‐anhydroglucitol from baseline to week 24 were analyzed. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, the HbA1c levels in patients of all groups decreased significantly from baseline. There were significant differences in the proportions of patients that achieved HbA1c <7% between groups, especially in group C and group D, compared with group A at week 24 (60.4%, 62.2% vs 25.5%, all P < 0.05). 1,5‐Anhydroglucitol changes were obvious in group A and group C at week 24 from baseline (all P < 0.05 within groups). Factorial analysis of anova showed that MPA intervention was the main effective factor for HbA1c change (F = 4.59, P = 0.034), and there was no effect on HbA1c change for SMBG intervention (P = 0.975). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the MPA, Diabetes‐Carer, is effective in improving the proportion of HbA1c <7% in patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Background: Secondary preventive therapies play a key role in the prevention of adverse events after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, adherence to secondary preventive drugs after CABG is often poor. With the increasing penetration of smartphones, health‐related smartphone applications might provide an opportunity to improve medication adherence. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using a smartphone‐based application to improve medication adherence in patients after CABG. Methods: The Measurement and Improvement Studies of Surgical coronary revascularizatION: medication adherence (MISSION‐2) study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial that planned to enroll over 1000 patients who underwent isolated CABG at one of four large teaching hospitals in China; all enrolled participants had access to a smartphone and were able to operate at least three smartphone applications. The investigators randomly assigned the participants to one of two groups: (1) the intervention group with an advanced smartphone application for 6 months which was designed specifically for this trial and did not exist before. Participants could receive medication reminders and cardiac health education by the smartphone application or (2) the control group with usual care. The primary outcome was CABG secondary preventive medication adherence as measured by the translated Chinese version of the 8‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS‐8) at 6 months after randomization. The secondary outcomes were mortality, major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), cardiovascular rehospitalization, self‐reported secondary preventive medication use after 6 months of follow‐up, blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), and self‐reported smoking status. All analyses were conducted using the intention‐to‐treat principle. Results: A total of 1000 patients (mean age, 57.28 [SD, 9.09] years; 85.5% male) with coronary heart disease after CABG were enrolled between September 2015 and September 2016 and were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 501) or control group (n = 499). At 6 months, the proportion of low‐adherence participants, categorized by MMAS‐8 scores, was 11.8% in the intervention group and 11.7% in the control group (RR = 1.005, 95% CI 0.682 to 1.480, P = 1.000). Similar results were found in sensitivity analyses that considered participants who withdrew from the study, or were lost to follow‐up as nonadherent. There were no significant differences in the secondary clinical outcome measures, and there were no significant differences in the primary outcome across the subgroups tested. In the intervention group, the proportion of participants who used and operated the application during the first month after CABG was 88.1%; however, the use rate decreased sharply from 42.5% in the second month to 9.2% by the end of the study (6 months). Conclusions: A smartphone‐based application supporting secondary prevention among patients after CABG did not lead to a greater adherence to secondary preventive medications. The limited room for improvement in medication adherence and the low participants' engagement with the smartphone applications might account for these non‐significant outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ProFibro application (app) was developed as a Mobile Health resource to promote self‐care in fibromyalgia management. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the effects of the use of the ProFibro app for six weeks compared to the use of a traditional paper book of similar content to improve health‐related quality of life, symptoms, and self‐care agency in individuals with fibromyalgia. METHODS: Forty individuals with fibromyalgia were included in this randomized, single‐blind, parallel trial. One group received intervention content using the ProFibro app on a smartphone while the other received similar information using a paper book. Participants were assessed at baseline and after six weeks. The primary outcome was the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were Widespread Pain Index, Pain Visual Analog Scale, Symptom Severity Scale, and Appraisal of Self‐Care Agency Scale ‐ Revised. RESULTS: No differences in changes were found between groups at the end of the treatment for any outcome. Both groups showed improvements in symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the ProFibro app for six weeks was not more effective than the use of a traditional paper book with similar content for health‐related quality of life, symptoms, or self‐care agency in individuals with fibromyalgia. Both groups showed improvements from baseline on severity of symptoms, suggesting that the self‐care program using a mobile app or a paper book may be beneficial for individuals with fibromyalgia.

AB  - Study design:: A randomized controlled trial. Objective:: To assess the effectiveness of a mobile‐based educational intervention on sexo‐marital life in Iranian men with spinal cord injury (SCI). Setting:: Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs’, “Spinal Cord Injury Association”, and the “Protection Center of Spinal Cord Disables”. Methods:: Participants were men with SCI aged at least 18 years old. The effectiveness of a mobile App was evaluated on 70 married men with SCI. Sexual adjustment, sexual satisfaction, marital adjustment, and marital satisfaction were assessed by valid and reliable questionnaires at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks after the intervention. Results:: The between‐group mean difference (95% CI) of sexual adjustment (4.2, CI: 3.6–4.8) after 4 weeks as well as 8 weeks (8.6, CI: 7.6–9.5) after baseline was significant (P < 0.001). The between‐group mean difference (95% CI) of sexual satisfaction (6.9, CI: 8–11.2) after 4 weeks as well as 8 weeks (16.4, CI: 14.1–18.7) after baseline was significant (P < 0.001). There were significant increases in all the domains of marital satisfaction’s between‐group mean differences after 4 weeks as well as 8 weeks after baseline (P < 0.001). Repeated measures ANOVA showed there was no statistically significant increase in marital adjustment’s between‐group mean difference (95% CI) after 4 weeks (−0.1, CI: −0.1– 0, P < 0.16) as well as 8 weeks (0.4, CI: −0.3–1.1, P < 0.25) after baseline. Conclusion:: The application��based educational intervention showed the positive effect of education on sexo‐marital life in men with SCI. We recommend the rehabilitation team’s healthcare providers embrace this educational strategy for individuals with SCI.

AB  - Background: Patients with type 2 diabetes upload and review blood glucose data between clinic visits. Many mobile phone applications (apps) that receive data from a “connected” glucometer and that support pattern management are available and have the capacity to make data upload and review less burdensome. The objective of this study was to assess whether the diabetic management app could improve glycemic control and diabetes self‐efficacy in a Chinese community hospital by a randomized controlled trial. Material/Methods: One‐hundred twenty patients with type 2 diabetes registered at the Community Health Service Center of Zhangjiawo Town, Xiqing District, Tianjin City, China were recruited and volunteered to participate in the project. They were randomly divided into the mobile app intervention group (n=60) and the control group (n=60) for a 6‐month observation. The control group was given conventional diabetic treatment and the app group was given the mobile app and conventional care. Self‐efficacy was measured by the Diabetes Self‐Efficacy Scale questionnaire. The differences between the 2 groups in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and diabetes self‐efficacy were evaluated at the third and sixth months. Results: At the sixth month, patients in the app group showed better HbA1c control (6.71±1.06 vs. 7.22±1.02, P<0.05) and improved self‐efficacy score (119.20±9.88 vs. 102.09±10.67, P<0.05). Conclusions: The mobile app helped patients with type 2 diabetes in a community hospital improve therapeutic outcome and self‐management behavior. It also provided experiences for prevention and management of other chronic diseases in community hospitals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent type of cardiac disease among adults worldwide, including those in Singapore. Most of its risk factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity and high blood pressure, are preventable. mHealth has improved in the last decade, showing promising results in chronic disease prevention and health promotion worldwide. Our aim was to develop and examine the effect of a 4‐week Smartphone‐Based Coronary Heart Disease Prevention (SBCHDP) programme in improving awareness and knowledge of CHD, perceived stress as well as cardiac‐related lifestyle behaviours in the working population of Singapore. METHODS: The smartphone app "Care4Heart" was developed as the main component of the programme. App content was reviewed and validated by a panel of experts, including two cardiologists and two experienced cardiology‐trained nurses. A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted. Eighty working people were recruited and randomised to either the intervention group (n = 40) or the control group (n = 40). The intervention group underwent a 4‐week SBCHDP programme, whereas the control group were offered health promotion websites only. The participants' CHD knowledge, perceived stress and behavioural risk factors were measured at baseline and on the 4th week using the Heart Disease Fact Questionnaire‐2, Perceived Stress Scale, and Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System. RESULTS: After the SBCHDP programme, participants in the intervention group had a better awareness of CHD being the second leading cause of death in Singapore (X 2 = 6.486, p = 0.039), a better overall CHD knowledge level (t = 3.171, p = 0.002), and better behaviour concerning blood cholesterol control (X 2 = 4.54, p = 0.033) than participants in the control group. CONCLUSION: This pilot study partially confirmed the positive effects of the SBCHDP programme in improving awareness and knowledge of CHD among the working population. Due to the small sample size and short follow‐up period, this study was underpowered to detect significant differences between groups. A full‐scale longitudinal study is required in the future to confirm the effectiveness of the SBCHDP programme.

AB  - A lack of adequate physical activity among young African American women remains a serious public health challenge. Few evidence‐based interventions are available to increase physical activity in this population, and none has leveraged mobile technologies, even though African Americans are among the most avid users of mobile applications (apps). We conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a mobile app‐based small‐group intervention in increasing physical activity among African American women aged 18 to 35 years (N = 91) in Philadelphia, PA. Cohorts of eight participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to a 4‐women small‐group intervention or an individual control condition. Control participants used the app to track their own activities. Small‐group participants could track their own activities and those of the other three women in their group and could message the other women using a chatting tool. The primary outcome was meeting the goal of engaging in at least 90 min/day of light physical activity during the 3‐month study period objectively assessed by a Fitbit device. Data were collected in 2016 and analyzed in 2017. Group participants had higher odds of meeting the goal (OR = 1.48, p = .048) than did control participants, an effect that did not wane during the 3‐month study period. Irrespective of condition, participants had lower body‐mass index (p = .01) and performed more push‐ups (p < .0001) at the 1‐month and 3‐month assessments compared with the baseline measures. Mobile apps facilitating small online groups can contribute to efforts to increase physical activity among young African American women.This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02736903.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low glycemic index (LGI) diet has shown to be effective in reducing maternal and neonatal complications in high‐risk pregnancies. OBJECTIVE: This trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of individualized LGI diet consultations based on the accurate diet glycemic load (GL) assessment tool on maternal and neonatal insulin resistance levels and diet behavior changes in overweight and obese pregnant women. METHODS: Overweight and obese pregnant women were recruited before 16 weeks of gestation and randomized to the LGI diet arm or the control arm. All participants received standard dietary education according to the Chinese Dietary Guide for Pregnant Women. In the intervention arm, additional individualized dietary GL assessments were performed using an app and instructions of lowering diet glycemic index (GI) to achieve LGI diet were provided by a clinical dietitian at early, middle, and late gestation. Primary outcomes were serum insulin at late gestation, incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) for mothers, and cord blood C‐peptide level of neonates. RESULTS: In total, 400 subjects were randomized and received different interventions. There were no significant differences in maternal serum insulin levels (13.2 [9.3‐13.2] uU/mL vs 12.4 [10.5‐12.4] uU/mL), incidence of GDM (45 [22.5%] vs 43 [21.5%]), or cord blood C‐peptide levels (mean 0.9ng/mL [SD 0.7] vs mean 0.8ng/mL [SD 0.6]) in the intervention group compared with the controls. The diet GI at late gestation was similar (mean 63.2 [SD 10.4] vs mean 64.3 [SD 10.4]), whereas greater diet fiber intake was observed in the intervention group (mean 11.6 grams [SD 8.0] vs mean 9.0 grams [SD 5.6]; P=.006). Adherence measurements did not significantly differ between 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized LGI diet consultations for overweight and obese pregnant women failed to make a significant difference in maternal or neonatal insulin resistance compared with the standard gestational diet consultation.

AB  - Mobile dietary record apps have been increasingly validated by studies with various study designs. This review aims to evaluate the overall accuracy of dietary record apps in measuring the intake of energy, macro- and micronutrients, and food groups in real-life settings and the designs of validation studies. We systematically searched mobile dietary record validation studies published during the period from 2013 to 2019. We identified 14 studies for the systematic review, of which 11 studies were suitable for meta-analyses on energy intake and 8 studies on macronutrient intake. Mean differences and SDs of nutrient estimations between the app and the reference method from studies were pooled using a random-effects model. All apps underestimated energy intake when compared with their reference methods, with a pooled effect of -202 kcal/d (95% CI: -319, -85 kcal/d); the heterogeneity of studies was 72%. After stratification, studies that used the same food-composition table for both the app and the reference method had a lower level of heterogeneity (0%) and a pooled effect of -57 kcal/d (95% CI: -116, 2 kcal/d). The heterogeneity of studies in the differences in carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake was 54%, 73%, and 80%, with the pooled effect of -18.8 g/d, -12.7 g/d, and -12.2 g/d, respectively, after excluding outliers. The intakes of micronutrients and food groups were statistically nonsignificantly underestimated by the apps in most cases. In conclusion, dietary record apps underestimated food consumption compared with traditional dietary assessment methods. Moreover, varying study designs have been found across studies. Recommended practices for conducting validation studies were formulated including considering biomarkers as the reference, testing in a larger and more representative study population for a longer period, avoiding the learning effect of each method, and comparing food group or food item consumption in addition to comparing energy and nutrient intakes.

AB  - AIMS: The primary objective was to evaluate the impact of the smart phone‐based diabetes management application, Welltang, on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The second objective was to measure whether Welltang improves blood glucose, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, weight, blood pressure, hypoglycemic events, satisfaction of patients to use Welltang, diabetes knowledge of patients, and self‐care behaviors. METHODS: One hundred evenly randomized subjects with diabetes, aged 18‐74years, were recruited from the outpatient Department of Endocrinology for a 3‐month study. The Welltang intervention group received training for the use of Welltang, while the control group received their usual standard of care. HbA1c, blood glucose, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, weight, blood pressure, hypoglycemic events, satisfaction of patients to use Welltang, diabetes knowledge of patients, and self‐care behaviors were measured. Patient data were analyzed using independent t test and paired sample test using SPSS version 12. RESULTS: The average decrease in HbA1c was 1.95% (21mmol/mol) in the intervention group and 0.79% (8mmol/mol) in the control group (P<0.001). Measures of self‐monitored blood glucose, diabetes knowledge, and self‐care behaviors improved in patients in the intervention group. Eighty four percent of patients in the intervention group were satisfied with the use of Welltang. Differences in hypoglycemic events, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, weight, and blood pressure were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Diabetes patients using the Welltang application achieved statistically significant improvements in HbA1c, blood glucose, satisfaction of patients to use of Welltang, diabetes knowledge, and self‐care behaviors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Growing evidence shows that fixed, nonpersonalized daily step goals can discourage individuals, resulting in unchanged or even reduced physical activity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to evaluate the efficacy of an automated mobile phone-based personalized and adaptive goal-setting intervention using machine learning as compared with an active control with steady daily step goals of 10,000. METHODS: In this 10-week RCT, 64 participants were recruited via email announcements and were required to attend an initial in-person session. The participants were randomized into either the intervention or active control group with a one-to-one ratio after a run-in period for data collection. A study-developed mobile phone app (which delivers daily step goals using push notifications and allows real-time physical activity monitoring) was installed on each participant's mobile phone, and participants were asked to keep their phone in a pocket throughout the entire day. Through the app, the intervention group received fully automated adaptively personalized daily step goals, and the control group received constant step goals of 10,000 steps per day. Daily step count was objectively measured by the study-developed mobile phone app. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of participants was 41.1 (11.3) years, and 83% (53/64) of participants were female. The baseline demographics between the 2 groups were similar (P>.05). Participants in the intervention group (n=34) had a decrease in mean (SD) daily step count of 390 (490) steps between run-in and 10 weeks, compared with a decrease of 1350 (420) steps among control participants (n=30; P=.03). The net difference in daily steps between the groups was 960 steps (95% CI 90-1830 steps). Both groups had a decrease in daily step count between run-in and 10 weeks because interventions were also provided during run-in and no natural baseline was collected. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed the short-term efficacy of this intervention, which should be formally evaluated in a full-scale RCT with a longer follow-up period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common psychiatric condition during the postnatal period that negatively impacts the well-being of both the mother and her infant. This study describes a systematic review and preliminary meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of mobile health (mHealth) interventions, which is defined as the use of portable electronic devices to support public health and medical practice, in addressing depressive symptoms among postpartum women. METHODS: Databases including PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on PPD from database inception to December 2019. RESULTS: The initial search identified 754 studies, of which, 11 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. These studies evaluated four types of distinct mHealth interventions and involved 2424 participants across six countries. Pooled results demonstrated that compared to the controls, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score decreased in the mHealth intervention group (mean difference: –1.09, 95% confidence interval: –1.39 to –0.79). DISCUSSION: Our study suggested that mHealth interventions may be a promising tool to complement routine clinical care in the prevention and treatment of PPD, but the clinical effectiveness of mHealth interventions needs to be better established. While most studies focused on telephone-based interventions, recent researches have also suggested the superiority and effectiveness of short messaging service (SMS) and smartphone applications, but the exact efficacy needs further evaluation. Therefore, more high-quality RCTs on app-based and SMS-based interventions are needed before the large-scale roll-out of these interventions in clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women undergoing chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer have frequently reported unmet supportive care needs. Moreover, easily accessible and innovative support is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this trial was to determine the effectiveness of an app-based breast cancer e-support program to address women's self-efficacy (primary outcome), social support, symptom distress, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Secondary objectives included exploring the association between women's health outcomes and the breast cancer e-support usage data. METHODS: A multicenter, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial was conducted. A total of 114 women with breast cancer, who were commencing chemotherapy and were able to access internet through a mobile phone, were recruited in the clinics from 2 university-affiliated hospitals in China. Women were randomized either to the intervention group (n=57) receiving breast cancer e-support plus care as usual or the control group (n=57) receiving care as usual alone. The health care team and research assistants collecting data were blinded to the women's group allocation. Bandura's self-efficacy theory and the social exchange theory guided the development of the breast cancer e-support program, which has 4 components: (1) a Learning forum, (2) a Discussion forum, (3) an Ask-the-Expert forum, and (4) a Personal Stories forum. Moderated by an experienced health care professional, the breast cancer e-support program supported women for 12 weeks covering 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Health outcomes were self-assessed through paper questionnaires in clinics at baseline before randomization (T0), after 3 (T1), and 6 months (T2) of follow-ups. RESULTS: Fifty-five participants in the intervention group and 49 in the control group completed the follow-up assessments (response rate: 91.2%). During the 12-week intervention, the log-in frequency ranged from 0 to 774 times (mean 54.7; SD 131.4; median 11; interquartile range, IQR 5-27), and the total usage duration ranged from 0 to 9371 min (mean 1072.3; SD 2359.5; median 100; IQR 27-279). Repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance (intention-to-treat) found that breast cancer e-support + care as usual participants had significant better health outcomes at 3 months regarding self-efficacy (21.05; 95% CI 1.87-40.22; P=.03; d=0.53), symptom interference (-0.73; 95% CI -1.35 to -.11; P=.02; d=-0.51), and quality of life (6.64; 95% CI 0.77-12.50; P=.03, d=0.46) but not regarding social support, symptom severity, anxiety, and depression compared with care as usual participants. These beneficial effects were not sustained at 6 months. Spearman rank-order correlation showed that the breast cancer e-support usage duration was positively correlated with self-efficacy (r=.290, P=.03), social support (r=.320, P=.02), and quality of life (r=.273, P=.04) at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: The breast cancer e-support program demonstrated its potential as an effective and easily accessible intervention to promote women's self-efficacy, symptom interference, and quality of life during chemotherapy.

AB  - Background. Excessive uninterrupted sitting is found to be associated with increased cardiometabolic disease risk in desk-based employees. Point-of-choice prompts using a smartphone application (SmPh-app) may be a feasible method of promoting physical activity and negating cardiometabolic disease risk. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of SmPh-app directed walk reminders on cardiometabolic disease risk (Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG), aerobic capacity (VO2 max) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in desk-based office employees. Methods. In this pragmatic, two-arm, parallel, cluster randomised trial, desk-based employees (n=53) of five administrative offices (clusters) of a university were randomised to two groups: SMART group in which employees were provided with SmPh-app based (six) walk reminders during working hours and CONTROL group in which employees continued their usual work. As FBG, VO2 max and HRV data were skewed, nonparamet-ric statistical analyses were used for intention-to-treat analysis. Results. Of 53 desk-based employees initially included in the trial, 47 completed the four weeks trial. Employees in SMART group showed a statistically significant difference in FBG (p < 0.001), VO2 max (p < 0.05) and nearly all domains (time, frequency and non-lin-ear) of HRV (pre-vs. post-intervention) compared to CONTROL group. SMART group employees were found to reduce FBG by 8 mmol/dL (interquartile range (IQR):-12.25 to-3.75 mmol/dL), improve VO2 max by 2.23 ml/kg/min (IQR: 0.12 to 4.34 ml/kg/min) and improve HRV in all the domains compared to CONTROL group. Conclusions. SmPh-app based walk reminders improved FBG, functional capacity and HRV in desk-based office employees.

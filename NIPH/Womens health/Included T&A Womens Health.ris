AB  - The aim of this paper is to review and to analyze the results of previous studies dealing with hysteroscopic treatment of postcesarean scar defects. A systematic review of publications indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed database identified a total of 11 studies dealing with resectoscopic treatment of postcesarean scar defect. The review was conducted in line with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and the PRISMA statement. In only few studies, patients were qualified for hysteroscopic surgery based on the measurement of the defect depth and thickness of residual myometrium above the pouch. Two principal techniques were used for the hysteroscopic treatment: resection of one edge of the scar diverticulum, and resection of the inferior and superior edges of the defect. Additionally, most authors performed electrocauterization of the niche bottom. Resectoscopic treatment turned out to be highly effective in the case of women with AUB. No complications of the hysteroscopic procedure have been reported. Methodological value of the reviewed studies was relatively low due to non-unified selection/verification criteria and incomplete, non-systematic postoperative assessment. In conclusion, hysteroscopic treatment seems to be a promising option in the management of postcesarean scar defects, but still further research is needed on the problem in question.

AB  - - Background Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, and thereby improve pregnancy outcome. This Cochrane Review is an updated review, first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2007 and 2014. Objectives To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirthâ€™s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (13 September 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria All randomised trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drug(s) with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, and where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results For this update, we included 63 trials (data from 58 trials, 5909 women), with moderate to high risk of bias overall. We carried out GRADE assessments for the main 'antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug' comparison only. Evidence was graded from very low to moderate certainty, with downgrading mainly due to design limitations and imprecision.For many outcomes, trials contributing data evaluated different hypertensive drugs; while we did not downgrade for this indirectness, results should be interpreted with caution. Antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug (31 trials, 3485 women) Primary outcomes: moderateâ€certainty evidence suggests that use of antihypertensive drug(s) probably halves the risk of developing severe hypertension (risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; 20 trials, 2558 women), but may have little or no effect on the risk of proteinuria/preâ€eclampsia (average risk ratio (aRR) 0.92; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.14; 23 trials, 2851 women; lowâ€certainty evidence). Moderateâ€certainty evidence also shows that antihypertensive drug(s) probably have little or no effect in the risk of total reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) (aRR 0.72; 95% CI 0.50 to 1.04; 29 trials, 3365 women), smallâ€forâ€gestationalâ€age babies (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.18; 21 trials, 2686 babies) or preterm birth less than 37 weeks (aRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.12; 15 trials, 2141 women). Secondary outcomes: we are uncertain of the effect of antihypertensive drug(s) on the risk of maternal death , severe preâ€eclampsia , or eclampsia, or impaired longâ€term growth and development of the baby in infancy and childhood , because the certainty of this evidence is very low. There may be little or no effect on the risk of changed/stopped drugs due to maternal sideâ€effects, or admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery (lowâ€certainty evidence). There is probably little or no difference in the risk of elective delivery (moderateâ€certainty evidence). Antihypertensive drug versus another antihypertensive drug (29 trials, 2774 women) Primary outcomes: beta blockers and calcium channel blockers together in the metaâ€analysis appear to be more effective than methyldopa in avoiding an episode of severe hypertension (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.88; 11 trials, 638 women). There was also an increase in this risk when other antihypertensive drugs were compared with calcium channel blockers (RR 1.86; 95% CI 1.09 to 3.15; 5 trials, 223 women), but no evidence of a difference when methyldopa and calcium channel blockers together were compared with beta blockers (RR1.18, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.48; 10 trials, 692 women). No evidence of a difference in the risk of proteinuria/preâ eclampsia was found when alternative drugs were compared with methyldopa (aRR 0.78; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.06; 11 trials, 997 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR: 1.24, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.19; 5 trials, 375 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.67; 12 trials, 1107 women). For the babies, we found no evidence of a difference in the risk of total reported fetal or neonatal death (including miscarriage) when comparing other antihypertensive drugs with methyldopa (aRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.14; 22 trials, 1791 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.57; nine trials, 700 babies), or with beta blockers (aRR: 1.23, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.88; 19 trials, 1652 babies); nor in the risk for smallâ€forâ€gestational age in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20; seven trials, 597 babies), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 1.05, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.73; four trials, 200 babies), or with beta blockers (average RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.60; 7 trials, 680 babies). No evidence of an overall difference among groups in the risk of preterm birth (less than 37 weeks) was found in the comparison with methyldopa (aRR: 0.91; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.22; 11 trials, 835 women), with calcium channel blockers (aRR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.23; six trials, 330 women), or with beta blockers (aRR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.66; 9 trials, 806 women). Secondary outcomes: There were no cases of maternal death and eclampsia. There is no evidence of a difference in the risk of severe preâ€eclampsia , changed/stopped drug due to maternal sideâ€effects , elective delivery, admission to neonatal or intensive care nursery when other antihypertensive drugs are compared with methyldopa, calcium channel blockers or beta blockers. Impaired longâ€term growth and development in infancy and childhood was not reported for these comparisons. Authors' conclusions Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy reduces the risk of severe hypertension. The effect on other clinically important outcomes remains unclear. If antihypertensive drugs are used, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers appear to be more effective than the alternatives for preventing severe hypertension. Highâ€quality large sampleâ€sized randomised controlled trials are required in order to provide reliable estimates of the benefits and adverse effects of antihypertensive treatment for mild to moderate hypertension for both mother and baby, as well as costs to the health services, women and their families. Plain language summary Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy What is the issue? The aim of this review was to determine the benefits and adverse effects of blood pressureâ€lowering drugs (antihypertensive drugs) for pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension (high blood pressure). The other aim was to assess the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs for their babies. Why is this important? During pregnancy, up to one in 10 women have blood pressure readings that are above normal. For some women, their blood pressure remains slightly high (termed â€˜mild to moderate high blood pressureâ€™), with no apparent complications. Some of these women go on to develop very high blood pressure. Very high blood pressure can result in a medical emergency if it affects the womanâ€™s organs (such as her liver, or brain in the form of a stroke). Also, it can seriously affect the growth and health of her baby. Drugs that lower blood pressure are used to treat mild to moderate high blood pressure, in the belief that this treatment will prevent the blood pressure from continuing to rise. Over the years, information from good quality research studies has been contradictory, so we cannot be sure if this drug treatment is worthwhile. What evidence did we find? This Cochrane Review is an update of a review that was first published in 2001 and updated in 2007 and 2014. We searched for randomised controlled trials in September 2017, and this review now includes data f om 58 trials involving more than 5900 women. A total of 31 trials with 3485 women compared a number of different blood pressureâ€lowering drugs to a placebo or no treatment. There were a further 29 trials involving 2774 women which compared one blood pressureâ€lowering drug with another one. The evidence showed that treating pregnant women who had moderately raised blood pressure with blood pressureâ€lowering drugs probably halved the number of the women developing severe high blood pressure (20 trials, 2558 women). However, blood pressureâ€lowering drugs probably had little or no effect on the risk of the baby dying (29 trials, 3365 women), and there is insufficient data on maternal deaths to make a judgement on whether this risk is lowered (five trials, 525 women). The use of blood pressureâ€lowering drugs may have little or no effect on the number of the women developing preâ€eclampsia (23 trials, 2851 women), or the number of women who had to change drugs because of sideâ€effects (16 trials, 1503 women). We found no difference in the number of babies born preterm, that is before 37 weeks (15 trials, 2141 women). There was also no difference in the number of babies born small for their gestational age (21 trials, 2686 babies). The quality of the evidence was mostly moderate (but for preâ€eclampsia it was low). This was due to a number of small studies, and problems with the way the studies were undertaken. The available evidence is still insufficient to demonstrate if there is any antihypertensive drug that is better than another. However, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers seem to be better than the alternative drugs for blood pressure control. What does this mean? More research is needed in order to confirm the true effect of antihypertensive drugs in mothers and in their babies, and to identify the drug which would be best.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the robustness of evidence for the efficacy of manipulative therapy in women with primary dysmenorrhea. METHOD: Seven electronic databases were searched for studies reporting data on manipulative therapy for women with primary dysmenorrhea. The primary and secondary outcomes were pain relief and quality of life, respectively. Quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) guideline. RESULTS: The search yielded 19 citations of which four were systematically reviewed and three eligible for meta-analysis. The systematic review showed above moderate methodological quality with a mean of 6.7 out of 10 on the PEDro quality scale. Manipulative therapy showed evidence of pain reduction in primary dysmenorrhea. CONCLUSION: Manipulative therapy could be considered as adjunct therapy in the relief of pain in primary dysmenorrhea. More high-quality research is needed before the evidence for their utilization can be ascertained. Particularly, items related to assessor blinding should be considered in future studies.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of prenatal interventions on maternal foetal attachment. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: In this study, a comprehensive review was performed to find articles published from January 2000 - December 2019 in the form of randomized and non-randomized clinical trials. To this end, online databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Proquest, Ovid, CINAHL and JAMA were searched. Duplicate articles were also excluded using Endnote X7 Reference. The results were then analysed via RevMan 5.3 software. Results: The results showed that foetal movement counting did not seem to be effective in increasing MFA by itself. But, this intervention alongside other attachment behaviours such as touching the belly and talking to foetus could enhance MFA. Therefore, the best interventions to improve MFA might be combined ones implemented in the form of counselling and training sessions.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node identification by near infrared (NIR) fluorescence with indocyanine green (ICG) is recognized in the literature as a useful technique. NIR fluorescence technology could become key in the prevention and management of lymphedema after axillary dissection for breast cancer. Here, we conducted a systematic review focusing on ICG imaging to improve lymphedema prevention and treatment after axillary surgery. A systematic literature review was performed using MEDLINE and Embase to identify articles focused on ICG imaging for breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). Qualitative analysis was performed to summarize the characteristics of reported ICG procedures. In situ tissue identification and functionality assessment based on fluorescence signal were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were appraised when reported. Studies relating to axillary reverse mapping, lymphography and upper limb supermicrosurgery combined with ICG imaging were identified. We included a total of 33 relevant articles with a total of 2016 patients enrolled. ICG imaging for axillary reverse mapping was safe for all 951 included patients, with identification of arm nodes in 80%-88% of patients with axillary lymph nodes dissection. However, the papers discuss the oncologic safety of the approach and how - regardless of the contrast agent - concerns limit its adoption. ICG lymphography is openly supported in BCRL management, with 1065 patients undergoing this procedure in 26 articles. The technique is reported for lymphedema diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity, staging, intraoperative mapping and patency control in lymphaticovenular anastomosis. The substantial advantages/disadvantages of ICG imaging procedures are finally described.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the most effective analgesia for pain relief during the outpatient endometrial biopsy (OEB) or outpatient hysteroscopy with endometrial aspiration (EA). DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. SETTING: Not applicable. PATIENT(S): Pre- or postmenopausal women undergoing OEB or outpatient hysteroscopy with EA for evaluation of uterine pathology. INTERVENTION(S): We conducted an electronic search of the following bibliographic databases: Medline via PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The intensity of pain during, immediately after, and 10-30 minutes after procedure assessed by the 10-cm visual analog scale. RESULT(S): Lidocaine spray was the most effective medication for reducing pain during OEB (P-score = 0.83) and immediately after OEB (P-score = 0.96). On the other hand, naproxen sodium was the most effective medication for reducing pain during outpatient hysteroscopy with EA (P-score = 1.00), followed by misoprostol plus lidocaine (P-score = 0.87). CONCLUSION(S): Lidocaine spray, either alone or with topical application of lidocaine, is the most effective medication for reducing the pain during and after the OEB. Naproxen sodium is the most effective analgesic option during outpatient hysteroscopy with EA.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a long-acting hormone-releasing uterine device that has many non-contraceptive benefits. The study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of LNG-IUS in the management of adenomyosis MATERIAL AND METHODS: we searched the following bibliographic databases: Medline via PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASEand Google Scholar for the relevant studieswhich used LNG-IUS in management of patients with clinically or ultrasonographic diagnosed adenomyosis.The main outcome measures are pain score at the end of follow-up, bleeding, symptomatic relief, uterine volume (mL), endometrial thickness (mm), and/or hemoglobin level RESULTS: Ten prospective studies (patients n=551) were included. The overall effect estimates showed that the LNG-IUS led to significant reduction in pain score after 12 months (standardized mean difference (SMD) -3.87, 95% CI [-5.51 to -2.23], p <0.001), 24 months (SMD -5.56, 95% CI [-9.80 to -1.32], p =0.01) and 36 months of insertion (SMD -3.81, 95% CI [-4.27 to -3.36], p <0.001). Similarly, the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) showed significant reduction until 36 months after LNG-IUS insertion (SMD -2.32, 95% CI [-2.91 to -1.73], p <0.001). The LNG-IUS led to significant reduction in the uterine volume at 12 months (SMD -0.60, 95% CI [-0.88 to -0.31], p <0.001) and 36 months after insertion (SMD -0.42, 95% CI [-0.69 to -0.14], p =0.003). CONCLUSIONS: LNG-IUS is a promising and effective option for the management of adenomyosis. Its use effectively reduced the severity of symptoms, uterine volume, endometrial thickness, and improved laboratory outcomes.

AB  - <b>Background:</b> Perineal trauma is a common problem that may affect women during vaginal delivery; this trauma can be either spontaneous (tear) or intentional (episiotomy). When repair of perineal trauma is required, adequate analgesics must be obtained. Topical products as lidocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream is one of the suggested methods, but still there is lack of evidence with regard to its efficacy and safety. <b>Objective:</b> The aim of this review is to assess the evidence of utilizing EMLA cream in comparison to local perineal infiltration anesthesia for pain control during perineal repair after vaginal delivery. <b>Data sources:</b> Medline, Embase, Dynamed Plus, ScienceDirect, TRIP database, ClinicalTrials.gov and the Cochrane Library were searched electronically from January 2006 to May 2018 for studies investigating the effect of lidocaine-prilocaine cream in relieving pain during repair of perineal trauma. <b>Methods of study selection:</b> All randomized controlled trials assessing effect of lidocaine-prilocaine cream versus local infiltration anesthesia in relieving pain during repair of perineal trauma were considered for this meta-analysis. Fifteen studies were identified of which four studies deemed eligible for this review. Quality and risk of bias assessment was performed for all studies. <b>Data extraction:</b> Two researchers independently extracted the data from the individual articles and entered into RevMan software. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Statistical heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Higgins chi-square and (I<sup>2</sup>) statistics. When heterogeneity was significant, a random-effects model was used for meta-analysis. Otherwise, the fixed effect meta-analysis was used when there was no significant heterogeneity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence about in-vitro fertilization (IVF) versus intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for the treatment of non-male factor infertility. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases searched using the following MeSH terms (Sperm Injection, Intracytoplasmic) AND (in Vitro Fertilisation) AND (Infertility). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: All RCTs included infertile patients due to non-male factors underwent IVF or ICSI were considered for this meta-analysis. One-thousand twenty-two studies were identified of which 20 studies deemed eligible for this review. DATA EXTRACTION: Three independent authors extracted the relevant data from included studies. The study outcomes were pooled in the form of relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) using Mantel-Hansel method. The main outcome measures are the fertilization rate, the implantation rate, the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), the total fertilization failure and the live birth rate. RESULTS: Regarding the fertilization rate, the pooled estimate did not favour either IVF or ICSI group (RR = 0.94; 95 %CI [0.82, 1.07]; p = 0.34). However, IVF significantly increased the CPR than ICSI (RR = 1.28, 95 %CI [1.11, 1.49]; p = 0.001). The overall effect estimate did not favor either of two groups regarding the implantation rate (RR = 1.25, 95 % CI [0.92, 1.68], p = 0.15). Similarly, no difference between both groups regarding the live birth rate (RR = 1.08, 95 % CI [0.79, 1.49]; p = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: No difference between ICSI and IVF regarding fertilization rate per oocytes, implantation rate and live birth rate in the treatment of non-male factor infertility, while IVF has significantly higher clinical pregnancy rate and higher risk of total fertilization failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite several studies on the effects of exercise training on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with breast cancer, no earlier study has systematically summarized their findings. Current systematic review and meta-analysis has been done on earlier clinical trials in this topic. METHOD: Relevant studies published up to August 2021 were searched through PubMed, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar using predefined keywords. Studies that examined the effect of exercise training on inflammatory biomarkers in adult women with breast cancer were included. RESULT: A total of 18 studies were included. Combining 11 effect sizes, exercise training significantly reduced CRP level (WMD: -0.55; 95% CI: -1.10, -0.01). However, it had no significant influence on serum TNF-α (WMD: -0.40; 95% CI: -1.30, 0.50) and IL-6 concentrations (WMD: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.53, 0.43) in 8 and 15 studies, respectively. Pooling 7 effect sizes, we failed to find significant changes in IL-8 following exercise training (WMD: -0.65, 95% CI: -1.57, 0.28). Moreover, we reached no significant findings for serum levels of INF-ɣ (WMD: -2.66, 95% CI: -7.67, 2.36), IL-1β (WMD: 0.03, 95% CI: -0.26, 0.21), and IL-10 (WMD: -0.70, 95% CI: -2.92, 1.52). Based on subgroup analyses, best findings were reached in long-term intervention and after concurrent training. DISCUSSION: Chronic inflammation is hypothesized to be associated with breast cancer development. We found significant reduction in CRP level following exercise training, which was more considerable after concurrent aerobic and resistance training and in long-term intervention. No significant changes were seen in serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, INF-ɣ, IL-1β following exercise training. Further studies are needed to find more details.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite several studies on the effects of exercise training on glucose and lipid profiles in patients with breast cancer, no earlier study has systematically summarized their findings. Current systematic review and meta-analysis have been done on earlier clinical trials in this topic. METHODS: Relevant studies published up to May 2020 were searched through PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar using predefined keywords. Studies that examined the effect of exercise training on serum glucose and lipid profiles in adult women with breast cancer were included. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included. Combining 10 effect sizes, exercise training had no significant influence on serum fasting plasma glucose concentrations (weighted mean difference [WMD] = 4.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.65 to 14.29). However, it resulted in significant reduction of serum insulin (WMD = -2.37; 95% CI, -3.57 to -1.16) and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (WMD = -0.71; 95% CI, -1.27 to -0.15) in 14 and 8 studies, respectively. Pooling 6 effect sizes, exercise training did not change serum total cholesterol (WMD = -11.99; 95% CI, -32.42 to 8.45), low-density lipoprotein (WMD = -3.21; 95% CI, -10.45 to 4.04), high-density lipoprotein (WMD = 4.13; 95% CI, -6.20 to 14.46), and triglyceride (WMD = -23.34; 95% CI, -66.96 to 20.29) concentrations. Subgroup analyses showed beneficial effects of exercise training on outcomes of interest among studies with higher methodological quality. CONCLUSION: Current meta-analysis demonstrated significant reductions in serum levels of insulin and insulin resistance following exercise training. However, exercise training had no significant effect on serum levels of fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein. Further high-quality studies are needed to shed light on this issue.

AB  - PURPOSE: This meta-analysis provides a large-scale comparison of prepectoral vs. subpectoral implant-based breast reconstruction, with primary outcomes of patient safety and efficacy. METHODS: Literature review was performed via PRISMA criteria, 33 studies met inclusion criteria for prepectoral review and 13 studies met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Patient characteristics and per-breast complications were collected. Data were analyzed using Cochrane RevMan and IBM SPSS. RESULTS: In 4692 breasts of 3014 patients that underwent prepectoral breast reconstruction, rippling was observed as the most common complication, followed by seroma and skin flap necrosis. Meta-analysis demonstrated statistically significant decrease in odds of skin flap necrosis and capsular contracture in prepectoral groups compared to subpectoral groups. Odds of infection, seroma, and hematoma were equal between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prepectoral breast reconstructionhas surged in popularity in recent years. This review and large-scale analysis corroborates current literature reporting a favorable safety profile with emphasis on patient selection. Variability in skin flap thickness and vascularity mandates thoughtful selection of patients whose overall health and intra-operative skin flap assessment can tolerate a muscle-sparing reconstruction.

AB  - Evidence of synergic health effects of co-supplementation with vitamin D and probiotics is emerging. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses PRISMA statement, scientific databases and the grey literature were searched, and a narrative review and risk of bias assessment were conducted. Seven randomized controlled trials were included, which had low risk of bias. Six studies were double-blind, and once single-blind, extended over 6-12 weeks, and included 50-105 participants. Conditions explored included schizophrenia, gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, osteopenia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and infantile colic. Supplementation frequency was daily or bi-monthly, with mainly vitamin D3, and Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Streptococcus. Comparators were placebo, vitamin D, lower vitamin D dose, and probiotics and lower vitamin D dose. The co-supplementation yielded greater health benefits than its comparators did in all studies except in one assessing IBS. Beneficial effects included decreased disease severity, improved mental health, metabolic parameters, mainly insulin sensitivity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and antioxidative capacity, and lower use of healthcare. Co-supplementation of vitamin D and probiotics generated greater health benefits than its comparators did. More studies in other diseases and various populations are needed to confirm these findings and to elucidate the optimal form, composition, and frequency of this co-supplementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and the amount of blood loss are directly related to management of the third stage of labor. No previous report has compared the effects of carbetocin to those of misoprostol. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effects of carbetocin to those of misoprostol for management of the third stage of labor and for the prevention of PPH. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library (Central), Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Ovid, clinicaltrial.gov , and PubMed databases on December 28, 2017. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed by 2 of the authors independently. Individual and pooled incidences were calculated for the included studies, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a fixed model for forest plots without heterogeneity and a random effect model for those with heterogeneity. RESULTS: Our search identified 117 studies; however, 29 studies were duplicate. Of the 88 non-duplicate studies, 5 met the inclusion criteria. Of these five studies, two are currently underway. Hence, three studies were finally included in our meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of the impact of carbetocin on PPH (500-1000 ml) was (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14-0.50). Carbetocin significantly reduced the need for additional uterotonics (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.49). Reduction in the hemoglobin level and blood loss during the third stage of labor was significantly lower in women who received carbetocin than in those who received misoprostol. The length of the third stage of labor was significantly lower in women who received carbetocin than in those who received misoprostol. The incidence of side effects, such as heat sensation, metallic taste, fever, and shivering, were significantly lower in women who received carbetocin than in those who received misoprostol. CONCLUSION: Although this review showed that carbetocin is effective for decreasing PPH, blood loss, the length of the third stage of labor, and the need for additional uterotonics, this conclusion should be considered with caution. Because assessment of PPH is a subjective issue and it is uncertain whether outcomes were assessed blindly in respect to treatment. We recommend future research to verify our findings. Also clinicians may like to consider use of carbetocin for women with low risk for PPH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the common vaginal infections among childbearing women. The usual treatment for BV is metronidazole; hence 30% of women have recurrence within 60 to 90 days after treatment. There are some studies which assessed the effect of secnidazole on BV. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of secnidazole for treatment of BV. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science (all databases from inception till October 28, 2018) were searched. Primary outcomes were clinical cure rate and microbiologic cure rate and the secondary outcomes were adverse events. Data was extracted from eligible studies by two review authors individually and analyzed by RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Our search found six trials involving 1528 participants. Treatment with 2 g secnidazole could significantly reduce the risk of BV in patients with three or less episodes of BV in the last year by OR: 7.54 (95% CI, 3.89-14.60, p < 0.00001) and in patients with four or more episodes of BV in the last year (OR: 4.74, 95% CI: 1.51-14.84, p = 0.0.008). Secnidazole (2 g) could significantly increase the microbiologic cure rate in women with 3 or less episodes of BV in the last year (OR: 7.63, 95% CI: 2.30-25.33, p = 0.0009) but not in the women with 4 or more episodes of BV in the last year (OR: 20.17, 95% CI: 1.06-382.45, p = 0.05). The clinical cure rate, microbiological effect and the therapeutic cure rate of 2 g secnidazole was significantly more than that of 1 g secnidazole. The results showed that the clinical cure rate of 2 g secnidazole was not different from the following medications: metronidazole (500 mg bid for 5 days), secnidazole plus vaginal metronidazole, 2 g single dose of oral metronidazole and 2 g secnidazole plus vaginal ornidazole. CONCLUSION: This review showed that 2 g and 1 g secnidazole were better than placebo, however, 2 g secnidazole was more effective than 1 g. Secnidazole 2 g was not different from metronidazole (500 mg bid for 5 days), or from secnidazole plus vaginal metronidazole, or 2 g single dose of oral metronidazole or from 2 g secnidazole plus vaginal ornidazole.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive procedure that has been studied in the management of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS). OBJECTIVE: To appraise HIFU in the management of PAS and highlight the restrictions on converting uterus-preserving studies into evidence-based practice. SEARCH STRATEGY: A search on Scopus, Cochrane, PubMed and Web of Science was conducted from date of inception to January 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies on using HIFU in the management of PAS were eligible. Review articles, conference papers, and case reports were excluded. DATA COLLECTION: A standardized sheet was used to abstract data from eligible studies. CON-PAS registry was used to include studies on other conservative modalities. RESULTS: Four studies were eligible (399 patients). Average residual placental volume was 61.74 cm<sup>3</sup> (6.01-339 cm<sup>3</sup> ). Treatment was successful in all patients. Normal menstruation recovered after 48.8 days (15-150 days). No major complications were encountered. Sixty-one studies were retrieved from the CON-PAS registry; uterine artery embolization (23 studies), balloon placement (15 studies), compression sutures (10 studies), placenta in situ (7 studies), and uterine resection (6 studies) were successful in 83.7%, 92.9%, 87.9%, 85.2%, and 79.3% of cases, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HIFU may fit certain clinical situations in the management of PAS. A global research strategy is recommended to incorporate conservative approaches within a comprehensive management protocol.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The adverse physical consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) have been thoroughly investigated and documented. Yet, we know little about the adverse mental health consequences of the practice. To fill this research gap, we systematically reviewed studies that assessed any adverse mental health consequences related to FGM/C. METHODS: We searched four databases from inception to 21 December 2018. We then reviewed all titles and abstracts for relevant studies. We used the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool to appraise the quality of each study and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to rate the risk of bias within studies. RESULTS: We included 16 studies in this review; only six studies examined the association between FGM/C and adverse mental health outcomes as the sole research question. Among the included studies, 10 were conducted at the participants' country of origin. The sample size of the populations studied ranged from 3 to 4800 participants. Only one study received a rating of 'good' methodological quality.Fourteen of the 16 studies reported an association between FGM/C and at least adverse mental health outcome. These included eight studies that reported a higher burden of adverse mental health outcomes among women who underwent FGM compared with women who did not undergo FGM/C. Four studies reported a correlation between the severity of FGM/C and the severity of adverse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSION: This systematic review documents an association between FGM/C and adverse mental health outcomes. Importantly, our review demonstrates the need for more rigorous research on the topic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine condition affecting women of reproductive age. It is characterized by insulin resistance and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective was to review the literature on the effect of different pharmacological interventions on insulin resistance in women with PCOS. DESIGN: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane library and the Web of Science in April 2020 and updated in March 2021. The study follows the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-ana. Reviwers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: In 58 randomized controlled trials there were significant reductions in the fasting blood glucose (FBG) with metformin versus placebo (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.40, -0.06; I2 = 0%, low-grade evidence), and acarbose versus metformin (mean difference [MD]: -10.50 mg/dl; 95% CI: -15.76, -5.24; I2 = 0%, low-grade evidence). Significant reductions in fasting insulin (FI) with pioglitazone versus placebo (SMD: -0.55; 95% CI: -1.03, -0.07; I2 = 37%; p = .02, very-low-grade evidence). A significant reduction in homoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was seen with exenatide versus metformin (MD: -0.34; 95% CI: -0.65, -0.03; I2 = 0%, low-grade evidence). No effect on homoeostatic model assessment of beta cells (HOMA-B) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological interventions, including metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone and exenatide have significant effects on FBG, FI, HOMA-IR but not on HOMA-B.

AB  - The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of uterine manipulators in facilitating total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). A literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, UpToDate, SpringerLink, ClinicalKey and Elsevier ScienceDirect databases was performed, and articles describing TLH with or without the use of uterine manipulators were retrieved. Complications related to the use of uterine manipulators are numerous, and although uterine manipulator seems to facilitate TLH, the procedure without a uterine manipulator seems to have a comparable safety and effectiveness, although evidence based on a direct comparison of the two approaches is limited without available controlled trials. Uterine manipulator may provide support in cases of large uteri, severe endometriosis, recto vaginal adhesions and regional anesthesia, while its use may increase complications in cases of vaginal stenosis and nulliparity. Therefore, to perform TLH, the surgeon should individualize for each case if uterine manipulator is needed and which manipulator best suits the surgical procedure requirements and case characteristics. Further studies comparing the two approaches are mandatory.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects up to 18% of reproductive-age females. The prevalence of obesity in PCOS patients reaches up to 80%, which is 2-fold higher than the general population. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 55 pharmacological interventions across 17 different outcomes in overweight/obese PCOS patients with hyperandrogenism manifestations for both short- and long-term follow-ups. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials comparing any conventional pharmacological intervention as a monotherapy or a combination in overweight/obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome and hyperandrogenism manifestations. Extracted data included three main parameters; I. Anthropometric parameters (BMI, Waist and Hip circumferences, and Waist/HIP ratio), II. Hormonal parameters (FSH, LH, FSG, SHBG, Estradiol, Total Testosterone, Free testosterone, DHEAS, Androstenedione), and III. Metabolic parameters (Total Cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, Triglycerides, Fasting glucose, Fasting glucose, HOMA-IR). Critical appraisal and risk of bias assessments were performed using the modified Jadad scale, and the overall quality of this network meta-analysis was evaluated according to the CINeMA framework. We performed both a pairwise meta-analysis and a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effect sizes with 95% CI, and we calculated the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) for each intervention. RESULTS: Our final search on May 15th 2021 retrieved 23,305 unique citations from searching six electronic databases. Eventually, 101 RCTs of 108 reports with a total of 8,765 patients were included in our systematic review and multi-treatments meta-analysis. 55 different interventions were included: 22 monotherapies, and 33 combinations. The two-dimensional cluster ranking of the average SUCRA values for metabolic and hormonal parameters with significant estimates revealed flutamide (77.5%, 70%; respectively) as the highest and rosiglitazone (38.2%, 26.3%; respectively) as the lowest, in terms of the overall efficacy in reducing weight and hyperandrogenism. However, cyproterone-acetate+ethinylestradiol exhibited a higher ranking in improving hormonal parameters (71.1%), but even a lower-ranking regarding metabolic parameters (34.5%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Current evidence demonstrated the superiority of flutamide in improving both metabolic and hormonal parameters, and the higher efficacy of cyproterone-acetate+ethinylestradiol only in improving hormonal parameters. Nearly all interventions were comparable in female hormones, FGS, HDL, glucose, and insulin levels improvements.

AB  - This review aims to evaluate if there are clinical benefits of curcumin (CUR) in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched to identify only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that assessed CUR in patients with PCOS from inception to May 5, 2021. Five RCTs were included with a total of 296 patients, with 148 among the CUR groups and 148 patients among the control group. Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias, three RCTs provided a low risk of bias and two provided a high risk of bias. Compared with the control group, CUR was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the glycemic control including fasting blood glucose (MD = -3.67; 95% CI = [-5.25, -2.08], p < .00001), insulin level (MD = -1.91; 95% CI = [-2.97, -0.84], p = .0005), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (MD = -0.55; 95% CI = [-0.83, -0.27], p = .0001), and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (MD = 0.01; 95% CI = [0.00, 0.02], p = .0005). The mean difference in total cholesterol was also statistically significant (MD = -15.55; 95% CI = [-30.33, -0.76], p < .04). The rest of the secondary outcomes, including LDL, HDL, sex hormone, body weight, and CRP, were not statistically significant. This review concluded that among patients with PCOS, the use of CUR demonstrated a significant difference from the control group for glycemic control. Those findings suggest that CUR confers clinical benefits in patients with PCOS. However, due to the limited number of the included studies, further high-quality studies are needed to establish the clinical efficacy of the CUR.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Most vaginal births are associated with trauma to the perineum. The morbidity associated with perineal trauma can be significant, especially when it leads to third- and fourth-degree perineal tears. We hypothesized that antenatal perineal massage could decrease the incidence of perineal trauma, particularly severe perineal tears and other postpartum complications. METHODS: We searched four different databases from inception until August 2019 for the available trials. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which assessed the effect of antenatal perineal massage (intervention group) versus control group (no antenatal perineal massage) in perineal trauma patients. Data were extracted from eligible studies and meta-analyzed using RevMan software. Primary outcomes were the risk of episiotomies and perineal tears. Secondary outcomes were perineal pain, second stage of labor duration, wound healing, anal incontinence, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs with 3467 patients were analyzed. Women who received antenatal perineal massage had significantly lower incidence of episiotomies (RR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.72, 0.87], p < 0.001) and perineal tears (RR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.67, 0.94], p = 0.007), particularly the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears (p = 0.03). Better wound healing and less perineal pain were evident in the antenatal perineal massage group. Antenatal perineal massage reduced the second stage of labor duration (p = 0.005) and anal incontinence (p = 0.003) with significant improvement in Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Antenatal perineal massage is associated with a lower risk of severe perineal trauma and postpartum complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Due to hormonal changes during the menopause, women experience a variety of perimenopause and postmenopause symptoms. This review examines the various aspects of nanostructured hormone therapy and its application in the treatments of menopausal symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Excerpta Medica DataBase, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched basing on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Seven eligible studies out of 51 related papers, which satisfied the initial search criteria, were extracted and carefully reviewed to clarify the role of nanomedicine in maintaining postmenopausal women's health. RESULTS: Review of the seven eligible studies confirmed nanostructured hormone therapy as a safe and effective method for the alleviation of menopausal symptoms. According to the existing studies, nanostructured hormone therapy decreased the mean daily frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSION: The use of transdermal nanoformulations in hormone therapy can relieve climacteric symptoms and prevent other postmenopausal symptoms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Menopause symptoms affect the various dimensions of women's lives and they can lead to reduction of their quality of life. Phytoestrogens can be used as an approach to diminish these symptoms. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of phytoestrogens on the treatment of urogenital menopause symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane library,Scopus and ProQuest were systematically searched from 2000-2020. All randomized clinical trials were included. The quality of the selected papers was evaluated by the CONSORT checklist. RESULTS: 33 eligible high-quality papers were reviewed. Various forms of phytoestrogens such as Pueraria Mirifica, fennel, Hop plant(Humuluslupulus L.), Glycine Max (L.) Merr, soy, red clover, black cohosh, ginsing, cimicifugaracemosa, genistein, diadzein, glycitein and isoflavone in the form of oral capsules and pill, food supplement, enriched powder, vaginal gel, cream and suppository could improve menopausal urogenital symptoms. The recovery rate in vaginal use of these phytoestrogens was greater than other consumptions. CONCLUSIONS: After using a variety of phytoestrogens in different forms indicators of urogenital atrophy and urinary disorders improved and women's sexual function improved after treatment. The use of phytoestrogens as a safe, low-risk compared to hormone therapy and almost accessible method for women can relieve urogenital symptoms and promote the sexual satisfaction and quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Engaging in physical activity following a diagnosis in breast cancer patients improves both survival rates and psychosocial health outcomes. The factors influencing the effectiveness of physical activity interventions for breast cancer patients remain unclear. This systematic review focuses on two questions: are there differences in outcomes depending on; the mode of physical activity undertaken; and whether group-based, or individual, programmes are proposed. METHODS: Five databases were searched (PsycINFO, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Central). Randomised control trials were included if they reported an intervention aiming to increase physical activity amongst breast cancer patients. A total of 1561 records were screened with 17 studies identified for final inclusion. Data extraction and risk of bias analysis were undertaken. A meta-analysis was not possible due to methodological differences between studies. RESULTS: Findings indicate no evident differences in outcomes based on exercise mode adopted. There are some indications that group interventions may have additional beneficial outcomes, in comparison to individual interventions, but this conclusion cannot be drawn definitively due to confounds within study designs, lack of group-based intervention designs, and overall lack of long-term intervention effects. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no indications of negative intervention effects, only 6 of 17 trials demonstrated significant intervention effects were maintained. Greater transparency in reporting of interventions, and research enabling a comparison of physical activity delivery and mode is needed to determine optimum physical activity interventions to maintain patient physical activity and outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of childbearing age. This study aimed to compare the effects of lifestyle interventions on anthropometric, clinical, and biochemical parameters in adolescent girls with PCOS. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was systematically searched to retrieve studies investigating the effects of lifestyle modifications in adolescent girls with PCOS, which were published up to December 2019. The primary outcome was Body Mass Index (BMI) and secondary outcomes were all manifestations of PCOS, including clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters. Random effect meta-analysis was applied for significant results. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test. RESULTS: This study showed significant improvements in luteinizing hormone (LH) (Pooled SMD = - 0.1.23; 95% CI, - 2.44 to - 0.03), and Free Androgen Index (FAI) levels (Pooled SMD = - 0.78 95% CI, - 0.1.42 to - 0.13) in adolescent girls receiving lifestyle intervention compared to baseline. This study also revealed that diet modifications alone were associated with a significant decrease in Body Mass Index (BMI) (Pooled SMD = - 0.45; 95% CI, - 0.76 to - 0.13), and FG score (Pooled SMD = - 0.81; 95% CI, - 1.33 to - 0.28). Exercise interventions were associated with significant changes in the menstrual cycles (Pooled SMD = 1.16; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.61), Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score (Pooled SMD = - 0.57; 95% CI, - 0.99 to - 0.15), LH (Pooled SMD = - 056; 95% CI, - 0.98 to - 0.14), Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) (Pooled SMD = - 0.81; 95% CI, - 0.1.24 to - 0.38), and Triglyceride (TG) levels (Pooled SMD = - 0.32; 95% CI, - 0.62 to - 0.02). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis concluded lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, can improve some clinical, metabolic, and hormonal parameters in adolescent girls with PCOS.

AB  - Introduction Fennel has many medicinal properties and is used in the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Given the widespread use of herbal medicine among women for menstrual problems and considering the fact that there has been no study to date about the effect of fennel on menstrual bleeding and duration of menstrual bleeding through systematic review, the present study was conducted to determine the effect of fennel on the amount (primary outcome) and duration of menstrual bleeding and its side-effects (secondary outcomes). Materials All articles, including Persian and English, with no time limit were searched for in the following databases: Medline (through PubMed), Scopus, EMBASE (through Ovid), Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, ProQuest, Clininaltrial.gov, SID, Magiran, Irandoc, and Iranmedex, using MeSH terms, including menstrual bleeding, menstruation, severity of bleeding, hypermenorrhea, menorrhagia, fennel, fennelin, Foeniculum vulgare, dysmenorrhea, and painful menstruation, which were searched separately or in combination. Two authors separately reviewed articles to determine the inclusion criteria, and any disagreement was resolved by reaching consensus with a third person. Results A total of 7993 articles were identified through searching the databases, of which 7327 were excluded as duplicates and 666 were screened for inclusion. Six hundread and forty six were excluded by title and abstract based on not being relevant to the review and being conducted on animals. Eventually, six articles were included in the study and four articles entered into the meta-analysis. The results from meta-analysis showed that using fennel caused a significant increase in mean menstrual bleeding in the first cycle after treatment in the intervention group compared to the control (Std. mean difference: 0.46; 95 % CI: 0.18-0.73; p = 0.001; I2 = 9 %). However, it had no significant effect on menstrual bleeding in the second cycle after treatment (Mean difference: 1.44; 95 % CI:-5.09 to 7.96; p = 0.67; I2 = 0 %). Conclusions The results of meta-analysis of four articles showed that in the first cycle after treatment, use of fennel increased menstrual bleeding in the intervention group compared to the control, but meta-analysis of two articles showed no significant difference between intervention and control groups in the amount of menstrual bleeding in the second cycle after treatment. Given the poor quality of articles, conducting clinical trials to determine the effect of fennel on menstrual bleeding appears necessary.

AB  - Recurrent implantation failure (RIF), as a challenging problem in human reproduction, is widely improved by intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), especially in patients with immunologic abnormalities. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the results of the studies in which RIF women were treated with IVIG, and pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage and implantation rate were assessed as the result of treatment. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, ProQuest and clinicaltrail.gov. Two cohorts, two cross-sectional and one quasi experimental studies were included in this study. Four out of five studies were included in meta-analysis and remained one study was narratively discussed. Data analysis was conducted by RevMan 5.2 software. Our meta-analysis results demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the pregnancy rate of cohorts (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.14-2.89, P = 0.01) and cross-sectional studies (OR = 11.12, 95% CI = 6.43-19.23, P < 0.00001), live birth rate of cohorts (OR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.30-3.61, P = 0.003) and cross-sectional studies (OR = 7.57, 95% CI = 4.53-12.64, P < 0.00001) in the IVIG group when compared to the control group, but there was no significant difference in the miscarriage rate. In conclusion, IVIG may be a beneficial therapeutic strategy in RIF patients selected according to relevant immunological disturbances. However, final conclusions on the efficiency of the treatment must await prospective, randomized controlled trials of sufficient size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary and secondary breast angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy with limited published literature. Optimal management is mostly based on expert opinion. Our study aims to describe a single institution experience with breast angiosarcoma and evaluate other publications on this topic to further clarify prognostic outcomes and treatment modalities in this disease. METHODS: Twenty two cases of breast angiosarcoma from Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center were retrospectively analyzed. Additionally, a systemic review and meta-analysis was conducted to study the association between survival outcomes, overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in both primary (PAS) and secondary breast angiosarcoma (SAS). RESULTS: 9 PAS patients (41%) and 13 SAS patients (59%) were retrospectively analyzed. No significant differences were noted in tumor characteristics and survival outcomes between PAS and SAS. Treatment modality had no significant effects on survival outcomes although adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated a trend towards improved RFS in high grade tumors. 380 PAS and 595 SAS patients were included in the outcome meta-analysis. Survival outcomes were significantly worse with high grade tumors and tumor size of > 5 cm. Adjuvant radiation therapy demonstrated significantly better RFS, while adjuvant chemotherapy had no effect on survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: Tumor size and grade seem to be reliable predictors of survival in both PAS and SAS. Mastectomy does not seem to be adding any additional benefit to BCS. Adjuvant radiation therapy showed statistically significant RFS benefit, while adjuvant chemotherapy can be beneficial in high grade tumors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Some studies have investigated the effect of Lavender on pain and the healing of wounds. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of Lavender on pain and wound healing of episiotomy. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science (all databases from inception until February 2020) were searched. Data were extracted from eligible studies by two review authors individually. Our inclusion criteria were full-text interventional studies published in English or any other languages. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.3. The protocol of this systematic review was registered in PROSPERO with the reference number CRD42020140623. RESULTS: Our search found six trials involving 415 participants. The use of Lavender could significantly reduce pain in women with episiotomy (95 % CI: -1.06 - -0.32). The use of Lavender has significantly improved the healing of episiotomy compared to the placebo (95 % CI: -2.13 - -1.34). In all studies, pain and healing of episiotomy were evaluated with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Redness, Edema, Ecchymosis, Discharge, Approximation (REEDA) scale respectively. CONCLUSION: This review showed that the use of Lavender (in any form) in postpartum has a significant effect on pain relief and healing of episiotomy wound. All six studies that were included in this systematic review were from developing countries. A high level of heterogeneity was observed in the effect of Lavender on pain but not the healing of the episiotomy. Therefore, the results should be considered with caution. Using Lavender may be considered for wound healing of episiotomy.

AB  - Acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) are a leading cause of ill-health and death globally. Individual or multiple micronutrients have been shown to modulate immune function and affect the risk and severity of a number of infectious diseases. We systematically reviewed the evidence on the impact of micronutrient supplements to reduce the occurrence of ARIs and shorten the duration of ARI symptoms among adults. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the pooled effects of vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) on the occurrence of ARIs and the duration of ARI symptoms. Vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI (risk ratio (RR)=0.97; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00; p=0.028) and shortened the duration of symptoms (per cent difference: -6% (95% CI -9% to -2%; p=0.003)). The RR of vitamin D to prevent ARI was farther from the null when diagnosis was based on clinical diagnosis or laboratory testing, compared with self-report and when the loading dose was <60 000 IU. Vitamin C supplementation reduced the risk of ARIs (RR=0.96; 95% CI 0.93 to 0.99; p=0.01) and shortened the duration of symptoms (per cent difference: -9% (95% CI -16% to -2%; p=0.014)). The effect of vitamin C on preventing ARI was stronger among men and in middle-income countries, compared with women and high-income countries, respectively. Zinc supplementation did not reduce the risk of ARIs but shortened the duration of symptoms substantially (per cent difference: -47% (95% CI -73% to -21%; p=0.0004)). Our synthesis of global evidence from randomised controlled trials indicates that micronutrient supplements including zinc, vitamins C and D, and multiple micronutrient supplements may be modestly effective in preventing ARIs and improving their clinical course. Further research is warranted to better understand the effectiveness that individual or multiple micronutrients have on SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment outcomes.

AB  - This paper reports a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of hyoscine-N-butylbromide (HBB) administration in hysterosalpingography (HSG). Four electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared HBB versus placebo or no intervention in infertile women undergoing HSG. Pain during and after HSG and different adverse events including nausea, vomiting, and dizziness were evaluated. Three RCTs with 335 patients were included. The analysis showed HBB was significantly effective in reducing pain during and after HSG (MD = -0.76 mm, 95% CI [-1.35, -0.17], p = 0.01) and (MD = -0.81 mm, 95% CI [-1.07, -0.56], p < 0.001), respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events between HBB and control groups. The methodological evidence quality was high as evaluated by GRADEpro. In conclusion, this review provides good evidence that prior administration of HBB is effective in reducing induced pain during and after HSG with tolerable side effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate piroxicam effect on different pregnancy outcomes among infertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART). METHODS: We searched for the available randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in four different databases during January 2021 that compared piroxicam (intervention group) to placebo/no treatment (control group) in infertile women performing ART. We extracted the available data from included studies and pooled them in a meta-analysis model using RevMan software. We pooled the dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using RevMan software. Our outcomes were rates of clinical pregnancy, ongoing pregnancy, miscarriage, and any adverse events. RESULTS: Seven RCTs met our inclusion criteria with a total number of 1226 patients. Piroxicam was linked to a significant increase in clinical pregnancy rate compared to control group (RR = 1.30, 95% CI [1.09, 1.55], p = .003). However, we did not report any significant difference between both groups in ongoing pregnancy rate (RR = 1.27, 95% CI [0.72, 2.24], p = .41). In addition, the rates of miscarriage and adverse events were not different among both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Piroxicam administration increases the clinical pregnancy rate among infertile women. However, piroxicam does not affect miscarriage and ongoing pregnancy rates.

AB  - Although arm lymphedema following breast cancer treatment is a common complication; breast lymphedema following treatment is not uncommon. Several risk factors were found to contribute to breast lymphedema, including axillary surgery, high body mass index (BMI), increased bra cup size, adjuvant chemotherapy, locoregional and radiotherapy boost, and upper outer quadrant tumors. We aimed to provide a review to help avoiding or management of breast lymphedema. The search term 'breast lymphedema' was combined with 'breast conservative surgery' and was used to conduct a literature research in PubMed and Medline. The term lymphedema was combined with breast, conservative, and surgery to search the Embase database. All papers published in English were included with no exclusion date limits. A total of 2155 female patients were included in this review; age ranged from 26 to 90 years. The mean BMI was 28.4 of the studies that included patients who underwent conservative breast surgery. Incidence of breast lymphedema ranged from 24.8% to 90.4%. Several risk factors were linked to breast lymphedema after conservative breast surgery, such as BMI, breast size, tumor size, tumor site, type of surgery, and adjuvant therapy. Treatment options focused on decongestive lymphatic therapy, including manual lymphatic drainage, self-massaging, compression bras, or Kinesio taping. Breast lymphedema is a relatively common complication, yet there is no clear consensus on the definition or treatment options.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to summarize and update the evidence concerning oral iron-based interventions compared to placebo or no iron-based interventions to prevent critical outcomes in pregnancy or treat critical outcomes in the postpartum phase. METHOD: Published systematic reviews (Feb 2018) and primary studies (from 2015 to March 2018) retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were examined. The AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) tool was used to assess the quality of reviews. GRADE was used to rate the quality of the evidence for critical outcomes. RESULTS: Antenatal care: Compared to placebo/no treatment, iron-based therapies reduced maternal anemia at term by 59% (seven trials at low risk of bias, RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.73; I<sup>2</sup> = 86%; moderate-quality evidence) and maternal iron deficiency anemia by 67% (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16-0.69; I<sup>2</sup> = 49%). There was no evidence of difference between iron-based therapies vs control in terms of side effects (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91-2.21), preterm delivery (13 studies: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84-1.03; low-quality evidence), low birthweight (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.79-1.13; low-quality evidence) and infant mortality (RR 0.93, 0.72-1.20; low-quality evidence). POSTNATAL CARE: There was insufficient evidence to determine whether iron-based therapies can reduce postpartum anemia. CONCLUSION: Iron supplementation is effective in preventing maternal anemia at term but not low birthweight, preterm delivery or infant mortality.

AB  - CONTEXT: Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections are effective in managing refractory overactive bladder (OAB). However, some patients exhibit a poor response and/or experience adverse events (AEs) such as voiding dysfunction necessitating clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) and urinary tract infections (UTIs). OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate whether poor response/AEs to BTX-A for idiopathic OAB are predictable. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar database were searched in March 2020. Studies reporting predictive factors for poor response or AEs were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, searched references, and extracted data. Risk of bias (Quality in Prognosis Studies [QUIPS]) and quality of evidence (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE]) tools were utilised. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 1579 articles, 17 met the inclusion criteria. These were cohort studies with predominantly level 3 evidence. Factors including male gender, frailty, comorbidity, increasing age, smoking, baseline leakage episodes, and various urodynamic parameters (bladder outlet obstruction index [BOOI], high pretreatment maximum detrusor pressure, and poor bladder compliance) were proposed as predictors of nonresponse. In predicting CISC use, male gender, comorbidity, increasing age, number of vaginal deliveries, hysterectomy, and urodynamic parameters (bladder capacity, postvoid residual volume, projected isovolumetric pressure value, bladder contractility index, and BOOI) were implicated. Female gender, males with their prostates in situ, and CISC were suggested to increase UTIs after BTX-A. CONCLUSIONS: This review has identified factors that may predict poor response/AEs following bladder BTX-A and help in counselling of patients. Overall, the quality of individual studies included was poor, limiting the certainty of evidence reported. Larger-scale, better-designed trials with uniform definitions of poor response are required to confirm these preliminary findings. PATIENT SUMMARY: This review assessed whether we could predict poor response or side effects to bladder botulinum toxin A injections in managing overactive bladder. Many different factors based on the patient, medical conditions, previous surgery, and pretreatment investigations were identified. However, the quality of included studies was generally poor, limiting their conclusions.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of daily oral bovine lactoferrin versus daily oral ferrous iron preparations for treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) during pregnancy. Searches were conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, ClinicalTrials.gov and CENTRAL databases from inception to February 2017 and the bibliographies of retrieved articles were screened. The PRISMA Statement was followed. Published English language randomized trials comparing lactoferrin with oral ferrous iron preparations in pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia were included. Quasi-randomized, non- randomized or studies including other known cause of anemia, gestational or pre-existent maternal diseases were excluded. Accordingly, 4 eligible trials (600 women) were analyzed. Primary outcome was change in hemoglobin level at 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary outcomes were; change in serum ferritin and iron, rates of gastrointestinal side effects, preterm birth, low birthweight, neonatal death and mean birthweight. Quality assessment was performed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Odds ratio and mean difference were used to integrate dichotomous and continuous outcomes respectively. Pooled estimates for change in hemoglobin levels at four weeks favored daily oral lactoferrin over daily oral ferrous sulphate (mean difference 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-1.55; P=0.04, 4 trials, 600 women). However, after subgroup analysis (degree of anemia), no significant difference in hemoglobin levels were found between both groups in mild anemia (mean difference 0.80; 95% CI -0.21 to 1.82, 3 trials, 372 women), but a significant increase favoring lactoferrin was reported in moderate anemia (mean difference 0.68; 95% CI 0.53-0.83; P<0.00001, one trial, 228 women). Significantly less gastrointestinal side effects were reported with lactoferrin treatment. No significant differences existed with regard to other outcomes. In conclusion, for pregnant women with IDA, daily oral bovine lactoferrin is just as good as ferrous sulfate in improving hematological parameters with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Thereby, lactoferrin should be the iron replacement agent of choice for treatment of IDA in pregnancy.

AB  - PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness of unilateral vs. bilateral laparoscopic ovarian drilling (ULOD vs. BLOD) for improving fertility outcomes in infertile women with clomiphene-resistant polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as well as its effect on ovarian reserve. METHODS: Searches were conducted on PubMed, ScienceDirect, ClinicalTrials.gov, and CENTRAL databases from January 1984 to January 2017. Only randomized trials comparing ULOD with BLOD were included. The PRISMA Statement was followed. Main outcomes were ovulation and clinical pregnancy rates per woman randomized. Secondary outcomes were; live birth and miscarriage rates as well as postoperative serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) concentration and antral follicle count (AFC). Quality assessment was performed by the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Eight eligible trials (484 women) were analyzed. No significant difference was found in rates of ovulation (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.47-1.11), clinical pregnancy (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.22-1.41), live birth (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.28-2.10), or miscarriage (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.33-2.84) when ULOD was compared with BLOD. The reduction in AMH was comparable between the two procedures (MD 0.64 ng/ml; 95% CI - 0.08 to 1.36). A significantly higher AFC at 6-month follow-up was found with dose-adjusted ULOD (MD 2.20; 95% CI 1.01-3.39). CONCLUSIONS: After carefully weighing up the well-known benefits of BLOD against a potential risk to ovarian reserve, clinicians could be advised to offer the fixed-dose ULOD to their infertile patients with clomiphene-resistant PCOS. This is concordant with the "primum non nocere" principal if LOD will be envisaged.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis is a frequent source of vaginal infection among reproductive-aged women. Astodrimer gel is a novel drug which demonstrated favourable outcomes for treatment of patients with bacterial vaginosis. AIM: We attempted to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which examined the efficacy and safety of astodrimer gel in patients with bacterial vaginosis. METHODS: We searched four databases from inception to August 15, 2020, using relevant keywords. We identified all RCTs which surveyed the efficacy and safety of astodrimer gel in treating patients with bacterial vaginosis. We appraised the quality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We pooled dichotomous outcomes as numbers and totals and reported them as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) under random- or fixed-effects meta-analysis models depending on heterogeneity. RESULTS: Three eligible studies comprising four independent RCTs and 1165 patients were identified (614 and 551 patients received astodrimer gel and placebo, respectively). For efficacy outcomes (n = 320 astodrimer gel versus n = 260 placebo), astodrimer gel was significantly superior to placebo for all pooled efficacy outcomes, including clinical cure rate (at 9-12 and 21-30 days), microbiological Nugent cure rate (at 9-12 and 21-30 days), patient self-reported absence of vaginal odor/discharge (at 9-12 and 21-30 days), resolution of Amsel criteria (at 9-12 days) and percentage of patients who did not receive rescue therapy during study. With respect to safety outcomes (n = 614 astodrimer gel versus n = 551 placebo), astodrimer gel demonstrated equal tolerability to placebo for all pooled safety endpoints, expect unfavourably for vulvovaginal candidiasis and treatment-related vulvovaginal candidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: Astodrimer gel is effective in treating bacterial vaginosis and corroborated by clinical (Amsel criteria) and microbiological (Nugent score) measurements as well as patient-reported symptoms. Moreover, astodrimer gel is largely safe and associated with marginal rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A wide range of drugs have been studied for first trimester medical abortion. Studies evaluating different regimens, including combination mifepristone and misoprostol and misoprostol alone regimens, show varying results related to safety, efficacy and other outcomes. Thus, the objectives of this systematic review were to compare the safety, effectiveness and acceptability of medical abortion and to compare medical with surgical methods of abortion <=63 days of gestation. METHODS: Pubmed and EMBASE were systematically searched from database inception through January 2019 using a combination of MeSH, keywords and text words. Randomized controlled trials on induced abortion at <=63 days that compared different regimens of medical abortion using mifepristone and/or misoprostol and trials that compared medical with surgical methods of abortion were included. We extracted data into a pre-designed form, calculated effect estimates, and performed meta-analyses where possible. The primary outcomes were ongoing pregnancy and successful abortion. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies composed of 22,275 participants were included in this review. Combined regimens using mifepristone and misoprostol had lower rates of ongoing pregnancy, higher rates of successful abortion and satisfaction compared to misoprostol only regimens. In combined regimens, misoprostol 800 mug was more effective than 400 mug. There was no significant difference in dosing intervals between mifepristone and misoprostol and routes of misoprostol administration in combination or misoprostol alone regimens. The rate of serious adverse events was generally low. CONCLUSION: In this systematic review, we find that medical methods of abortion utilizing combination mifepristone and misoprostol or misoprostol alone are effective, safe and acceptable. More robust studies evaluating both the different combination and misoprostol alone regimens are needed to strengthen existing evidence as well as assess patient perspectives towards a particular regimen.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine pCD incidence and risk factors in CEA patients. DESIGN: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of both randomised and nonrandomised trials following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. DATA SOURCES: We searched Cochrane, PubMed/Medline and Embase databases from the date of database inception to 1 December 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We selected longitudinal studies including CEA patients with both pre-operative and postoperative cognitive assessments. Primary outcome was pCD incidence, differentiating delayed neurocognitive recovery (dNCR) and postoperative neurocognitive disorder (pNCD). dNCR and pNCD incidences were expressed as proportions of cases on total CEA sample and pooled as weighted estimates from proportions. Postoperative delirium was excluded from the study design. Secondary outcomes were patient-related (i.e. age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, contralateral stenosis, pre-operative symptoms, dyslipidaemia and statin use) and procedure-related (i.e. hyperperfusion, cross-clamping duration and shunting placement) risk factors for pCD. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences through a random effects model by using STATA 13.1 and RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: Our search identified 5311 publications and 60 studies met inclusion criteria reporting a total of 4823 CEA patients. dNCR and pNCD incidence were 20.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 17.1 to 24.0] and 14.1% (95% CI, 9.5 to 18.6), respectively. pCD risk was higher in patients experiencing hyperperfusion during surgery (OR, 35.68; 95% CI, 16.64 to 76.51; P < 0.00001; I = 0%), whereas dNCR risk was lower in patients taking statins before surgery (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.77; P = 0.0004; I = 19%). Sensitivity analysis revealed that longer cross-clamping duration was a predictor for dNCR (mean difference, 5.25 min; 95% CI, 0.87 to 9.63; P = 0.02; I = 49%). CONCLUSION: We found high incidences of dNCR (20.5%) and pNCD (14.1%) after CEA. Hyperperfusion seems to be a risk factor for pCD, whereas the use of statins is associated with a lower risk of dNCR. An increased cross-clamping duration could be a risk factor for dNCR. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CDR42017073633).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the current evidence on the role of immunotherapy in IVF and in the management of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, PUBMED, CINAHL, and EMBASE until May 2017. Only randomized controlled trials were included, and a meta-analysis was carried out where appropriate. PATIENT(S): Women undergoing IVF treatment with or without a history of recurrent implantation failure and women with idiopathic RPL. INTERVENTION(S): Assessment of the efficacy of commonly used immunomodulators such as IV use of [1] immunoglobulin, [2] lymphocyte immunotherapy and [3] intralipid; intrauterine infusion of [4] granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and [5] peripheral blood mononuclear cells; subcutaneous administration of [6] TNF-alpha inhibitors, [7] leukaemia inhibitory factor; and oral administration of [8] glucocorticoids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcomes were live birth rate and miscarriage rate; secondary outcome was clinical pregnancy rate. RESULT(S): Of the 7,226 publications identified, 53 were selected during the initial screening; 30 satisfied the selection criteria and were included in this review. CONCLUSION(S): The available medical literature shows controversial results about the role of immunotherapy when used for improving reproductive outcomes. This study did not show a role for immunotherapy in improving the live birth rate in women undergoing IVF treatment or in the prevention of idiopathic RPL. Currently, immunotherapy should be used in the context of research and should not be used in routine clinical practice to improve reproductive outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine the effect of prenatal exercise on birth outcomes in women with pre-gestational diseases, including chronic hypertension, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A structured search of online databases up to June 8, 2018 was conducted. Studies of all designs and languages were included if they contained information on the population (pregnant women with pre-gestational diseases), intervention (subjective or objective measures of frequency, intensity, duration, volume, or type of exercise), comparator (no exercise or different frequency, intensity, duration, volume, or type of exercise), and outcome (birth weight, macrosomia [birth weight >4000 g], large for gestational age (LGA) low birth weight [<2500 g], small for gestational age (SGA) [<10th percentile], Apgar score, preterm birth [<37 weeks], CS, preeclampsia, and glycemic control). RESULTS: A total of five studies (n = 221 women) were included. Canadian Task Classification was designated as level I. "Low" to "very low" quality evidence revealed that prenatal exercise reduced the odds of CS by 55% in women with type 1 diabetes and chronic hypertension (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.22-0.95, I2 = 0%). The odds of low (<2500 g) or high (>4000 g) birth weight, Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes, preeclampsia, and preterm birth were not different between women who exercised and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exercise reduced the odds of CS and did not increase the risk of adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes in mothers with pre-gestational medical conditions. Findings are based on limited evidence, thus suggesting a need for high-quality investigations on exercise in this population of women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Combined oral contraceptives are often considered a treatment option for women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) also seeking contraception, but evidence for this treatment is scarce. We aimed to determine 1) the level of evidence for the efficacy of combined oral contraceptives in managing premenstrual depressive symptoms and overall premenstrual symptomatology, and 2) the comparative efficacy of combined oral contraceptives (PROSPERO registration number CRD42020205510). DATA SOURCES: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Emcare, and EMBASE from inception to June 3rd, 2021. STUDY ELIGIBILITY: All randomized clinical trials that evaluated efficacy of combined oral contraceptives in women with PMS or PMDD were considered eligible for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: A random effect Bayesian pairwise and network meta-analysis was conducted with change in premenstrual depressive symptoms and overall premenstrual symptomatology between baseline and 3 cycles as outcome. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Of 3664 records, nine eligible trials were included that studied 1205 women with PMS or PMDD (mean age per study range: 24.6-36.5 years). The pairwise meta-analysis revealed that combined oral contraceptives were more efficacious than placebo in treating overall premenstrual symptomatology (standardized mean difference SMD [95%CrI], 0.41 [0.17, 0.67]), but not premenstrual depressive symptoms specifically (SMD [95%CrI], 0.22 [-0.06, 0.47]). However, none of the combined oral contraceptives were more effective than each other in reducing premenstrual depressive symptoms and overall premenstrual symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Combined oral contraceptives may improve overall premenstrual symptomatology in women with PMS or PMDD, but not premenstrual depressive symptoms. There is no evidence for one combined oral contraceptive being more efficacious than any other.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) is increasing, despite unproven oncological safety in the therapeutic setting. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the safety and efficacy of NSM compared with skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM). METHODS: A literature search of all original studies including RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies comparing women undergoing therapeutic NSM or SSM for breast cancer was undertaken. Primary outcomes were oncological outcomes; secondary outcomes were clinical, aesthetic, patient-reported and quality-of-life outcomes. Data analysis was undertaken to explore the relationship between NSM and SSM, and preselected outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane tests. RESULTS: A total of 690 articles were identified, of which 14 were included. There was no statistically significant difference in 5-year disease-free survival and mortality for NSM and SSM groups, where data were available. Local recurrence rates were also similar for NSM and SSM (3·9 versus 3·3 per cent respectively; P = 0·45). NSM had a partial or complete nipple necrosis rate of 15·0 per cent, and a higher complication rate than SSM (22·6 versus 14·0 per cent respectively). The higher overall complication rate was due to the rate of nipple necrosis in the NSM group (15·0 per cent). CONCLUSION: In carefully selected cases, NSM is a viable choice for women with breast cancer who need to have a mastectomy. More research is needed to help further refine which surgical approaches to NSM optimize outcomes.

AB  - Objectives:The definition and the indication for the treatment of iron deficiency without anaemia (iron deficiency no anaemia, IDNA) are controversially discussed in Switzerland. In a first step the aim was to assess the clinical effectiveness of iron therapy (irrespective of the route of administration) compared to any other intervention including placebo or no therapy in IDNA populations having symptoms such as fatigue, depression, restless legs syndrome (RLS), sleep disorders, hair loss, brittle nails, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and cognitive deficit. In addition to this step, an individual patient data meta-analysis of trials comparing iron therapy versus control was conducted to identify any subgroups (e.g. baseline ferritin level) in women with IDNA and fatigue who would particularly benefit from iron therapy. In the second step, a health economic evaluation of parenteral versus oral iron therapy in symptomatic IDNA populations benefiting from iron therapy was conducted. Conclusions:In the clinical effectiveness assessment, three symptomatic IDNA populations were identified. Eight RCTs investigated adults with restless legs syndrome (RLS), four RCTs women with fatigue and one RCT children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In patients with RLS (eight RCTs), iron therapy compared to control let to a statistically significant reduction of RLS symptom severity and a statistically significant improvement in RLS treatment response. A potential “placebo effect” cannot be excluded in six out of seven trials reporting on RLS symptom severity. For the outcomes sleep, sleepiness, quality of life, global impression, depression and fatigue no statistically significant effect for iron therapy compared to control was found. In women with IDNA and fatigue (four RCTs), iron therapy compared to control statistically significantly improved fatigue severity (measured as a continuous variable), improved subscores for mental and physical health quality of life and anxiety. A potential “placebo effect” cannot be excluded in the trials reporting on fatigue severity. For the outcomes fatigue improvement (measured as binary variable), quality of life total scores, and depression scores no statistically significant effect was found for iron therapy compared to control. Although the overall quality of evidence from trials in patients with IDNA and fatigue or RLS was judged to be very low, it is likely that a substantial proportion of patients may experience a reduction in fatigue severity or RLS symptom severity from iron therapy (irrespective of the route of administration). Methods:For the clinical effectiveness a systematic literature search was conducted in Medline and CENTRAL to identify relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The systematic review was conducted according to principles of the Cochrane Handbook. Quality of Evidence was evaluated according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). For the economic evaluation, it was decided to restrict the evaluation to a cost-comparison analysis, rather than a cost-effectiveness analysis, and a budget impact analysis from a health care payer perspective because no data from RCTs with a direct comparison of parenteral and oral iron therapy could be identified and because no reliable estimation of differential effects can be expected from an indirect comparison of the available RCT data from the clinical effectiveness assessment (step one). For the cost-comparison, the medical costs of all health care services of the different routes of iron administration were modelled with a decision tree over a time horizon of one year reflecting the current clinical practice in Switzerland. The model was parametrized primarily with empirical evidence from the clinical trials identified in step one of this HTA report, from additional clinical literature and from opinions of clinical experts. The budget impact analysis was based on the results from the cost-comparison analysis, epidemiological data available for Switzerland and expert opinions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is) and endocrine therapy (ET) is standard of care for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (BC). However, studies evaluating adjuvant CDK4/6is provided contradictory results thus far. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess if the addition of CDK4/6is to adjuvant ET impacts on survival's outcomes and safety of patients with HR+/HER2- early BC (EBC). This study was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered in the PROSPERO database (ID: CRD42020218597). A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE databases and major conference proceedings was performed up to 15 December 2020. All randomized controlled trials including patients with HR+/HER2- EBC treated with CDK4/6is plus ET versus ET alone in the adjuvant setting were included. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) for survival and safety outcomes, respectively, were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using random effect models. RESULTS: With data available from three studies (N = 12 647), the addition of CDK4/6is to adjuvant ET showed a trend for a benefit in terms of invasive disease-free survival (IDFS; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.01; P = 0.071). No significant improvement in distant relapse-free survival was observed (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.58-1.19; P = 0.311). The risk of all-grade toxicities and early treatment discontinuation increased significantly with the addition of CDK4/6is to ET (OR 9.36, 95% CI 3.46-25.33, P < 0.001, and OR 22.11, 95% CI 9.45-51.69, P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The administration of adjuvant CDK4/6is to patients with HR+/HER2- EBC showed a trend for an IDFS benefit and an increase in the risk of toxicities and treatment discontinuation. The role of adjuvant CDK4/6is remains controversial and a longer follow-up of these randomized controlled trials is needed before supporting a straightforward change in clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer represents a heterogeneous breast cancer subtype, including both estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative tumours. A deeper understanding of the crosstalk between ER and HER2 receptor pathways has led to the development of treatment strategies consisting of a simultaneous blockade of both signaling pathways, as a reasonable approach to prevent the onset of mechanisms of resistance. METHODS: This review was based on the material searched on PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase databases and on conference proceedings from major oncology conferences up to December 15, 2020. The search strategy included the following keywords: 'HER2-positive breast cancer', 'CDK 4-6 inhibitors' and 'PI3K inhibitors', and was adapted for use with different bibliographic databases. RESULTS: CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibitors are two classes of agents already approved in patients with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Recently, promising data with their use have been also shown in HER2+ disease. Results from preclinical and clinical studies are shedding light on the role of these classes of agents in HER2+ breast cancer, and are paving the road for a forthcoming change in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment landscape for HER2+ breast cancer is rapidly changing, and CDK4/6 and PI3K inhibitors represent a new promising strategy to improve patients' outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To collect available evidence on management of large vessel vasculitis to inform the 2018 update of the EULAR management recommendations. Methods: Two independent systematic literature reviews were performed, one on diagnosis and monitoring and the other on drugs and surgical treatments. Using a predefined PICO (population, intervention, comparator and outcome) strategy, Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were accessed. Eligible papers were reviewed and results condensed into a summary of findings table. This paper reports the main results for Takayasu arteritis (TAK). Results: A total of 287 articles were selected. Relevant heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. Males appear to have more complications than females. The presence of major complications, older age, a progressive disease course and a weaker inflammatory response are associated with a more unfavourable prognosis. Evidence for details on the best disease monitoring scheme was not found. High-quality evidence to guide the treatment of TAK was not found. Glucocorticoids are widely accepted as first-line treatment. Conventional immunosuppressive drugs and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors were beneficial in case series and uncontrolled studies. Tocilizumab failed the primary endpoint (time to relapse) in a randomised controlled clinical trial; however, results still favoured tocilizumab over placebo. Vascular procedures may be required, and outcome is better when performed during inactive disease. Conclusions: Evidence to guide monitoring and treatment of patients with TAK is predominantly derived from observational studies with low level of evidence. Therefore, higher-quality studies are needed in the future.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) in the prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis (RD). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using seven databases and the gray literature. We performed a meta-analysis to summarize the effect sizes of response rates (RRs). RESULTS: We included seven clinical trials. Breast cancer patients receiving PBMT developed more grade 1 RD than the control group (RR 1.55, 95 % CI 1.14-2.10, I<sup>2</sup>=51 %). PBMT appears to prevent RD grade 2 (RR 0.33, 95 % CI 0.09-1.23, I<sup>2</sup>=85 %) and RD grade 3 (RR 0.21, 95 % CI 0.05-0.94, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) with very low certainty of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: There is very low certainty of evidence that PBMT was effective in the prevention of RD. However, PBMT showed a significant effect to prevent grade 3 RD in breast cancer patients. Thus, further randomized clinical trials are required to confirm the promising effect of PBMT in RD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review aims to identify non-medical interventions that may reduce the fear of childbirth, directly or indirectly (through its factors). METHODS: This review followed the PRISMA guidance and a rigorous protocol that was registered in PROSPERO. Searches were done in ProQuest, the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Google Scholar. All RCTs published in the last 5 years, in English or Spanish, regarding women with a low-risk pregnancy and without mental disorders were included. RESULTS: From 5147 articles found, only 69 were full-text assessed. Finally, 18 studies were included suggesting that prenatal education, psychoeducation, and counseling might be effective, whereas cognitive-behavioral therapy and some alternative therapies require more research. The results of relaxation techniques were contradictory. Results also suggest that social support and exposure (through education) might have an important role in the efficacy of interventions. CONCLUSIONS: More appropriately randomized and blinded trials are necessary that use a prespecified definition of fear of childbirth and comprehensive measurement tools specific for pregnant women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesions are fibrin bands that are a common consequence of gynaecological surgery. They are caused by conditions that include pelvic inflammatory disease and endometriosis. Adhesions are associated with comorbidities, including pelvic pain, subfertility, and small bowel obstruction. Adhesions also increase the likelihood of further surgery, causing distress and unnecessary expenses. Strategies to prevent adhesion formation include the use of fluid (also called hydroflotation) and gel agents, which aim to prevent healing tissues from touching one another, or drugs, aimed to change an aspect of the healing process, to make adhesions less likely to form. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of fluid and pharmacological agents on rates of pain, live births, and adhesion prevention in women undergoing gynaecological surgery. SEARCH METHODS: We searched: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Epistemonikos to 22 August 2019. We also checked the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials investigating the use of fluid (including gel) and pharmacological agents to prevent adhesions after gynaecological surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE methods. Outcomes of interest were pelvic pain; live birth rates; incidence of, mean, and changes in adhesion scores at second look-laparoscopy (SLL); clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy rates; quality of life at SLL; and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 trials (3492 women), and excluded 11. We were unable to include data from nine studies in the statistical analyses, but the findings of these studies were broadly in keeping with the findings of the meta-analyses. Hydroflotation agents versus no hydroflotation agents (10 RCTs) We are uncertain whether hydroflotation agents affected pelvic pain (odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 2.09; one study, 226 women; very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether hydroflotation agents affected live birth rates (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.58; two studies, 208 women; low-quality evidence) compared with no treatment. Hydroflotation agents reduced the incidence of adhesions at SLL when compared with no treatment (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.55, four studies, 566 women; high-quality evidence). The evidence suggests that in women with an 84% chance of having adhesions at SLL with no treatment, using hydroflotation agents would result in 54% to 75% having adhesions. Hydroflotation agents probably made little or no difference to mean adhesion score at SLL (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.06, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.09; four studies, 722 women; moderate-quality evidence). It is unclear whether hydroflotation agents affected clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.14; three studies, 310 women; moderate-quality evidence) compared with no treatment. This suggests that in women with a 26% chance of clinical pregnancy with no treatment, using hydroflotation agents would result in a clinical pregnancy rate of 11% to 28%. No studies reported any adverse events attributable to the intervention. Gel agents versus no treatment (12 RCTs) No studies in this comparison reported pelvic pain or live birth rate. Gel agents reduced the incidence of adhesions at SLL compared with no treatment (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.57; five studies, 147 women; high-quality evidence). This suggests that in women with an 84% chance of having adhesions at SLL with no treatment, the use of gel agents would result in 39% to 75% having adhesions. It is unclear whether gel agents affected mean adhesion scores at SLL (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -1.09 to 0.09; four studies, 159 women; moderate-quality evidence), or clinical pregnancy rate (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.02; one study, 30 women; low-quality evidence). No studies in this comparison reporte on adverse events attributable to the intervention. Gel agents versus hydroflotation agents when used as an instillant (3 RCTs) No studies in this comparison reported pelvic pain, live birth rate or clinical pregnancy rate. Gel agents probably reduce the incidence of adhesions at SLL when compared with hydroflotation agents (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.83; three studies, 538 women; moderate-quality evidence). This suggests that in women with a 46% chance of having adhesions at SLL with a hydroflotation agent, the use of gel agents would result in 21% to 41% having adhesions. We are uncertain whether gel agents improved mean adhesion scores at SLL when compared with hydroflotation agents (MD -0.79, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.76; one study, 77 women; very low-quality evidence). No studies in this comparison reported on adverse events attributable to the intervention. Steroids (any route) versus no steroids (4 RCTs) No studies in this comparison reported pelvic pain, incidence of adhesions at SLL or mean adhesion score at SLL. It is unclear whether steroids affected live birth rates compared with no steroids (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.62; two studies, 223 women; low-quality evidence), or clinical pregnancy rates (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; three studies, 410 women; low-quality evidence). No studies in this comparison reported on adverse events attributable to the intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Gels and hydroflotation agents appear to be effective adhesion prevention agents for use during gynaecological surgery, but we found no evidence indicating that they improve fertility outcomes or pelvic pain, and further research is required in this area. It is also worth noting that for some comparisons, wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect meant that clinical harm as a result of interventions could not be excluded. Future studies should measure outcomes in a uniform manner, using the modified American Fertility Society score. Statistical findings should be reported in full. No studies reported any adverse events attributable to intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic adhesions can form secondary to inflammation, endometriosis, or surgical trauma. Strategies to reduce pelvic adhesion formation include placing barrier agents such as oxidised regenerated cellulose, polytetrafluoroethylene, and fibrin or collagen sheets between pelvic structures. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on rates of pain, live birth, and postoperative adhesions in women of reproductive age. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following databases in August 2019: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Epistemonikos, and trial registries. We searched reference lists of relevant papers, conference proceedings, and grey literature sources. We contacted pharmaceutical companies for information and handsearched relevant journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of barrier agents compared with other barrier agents, placebo, or no treatment for prevention of adhesions in women undergoing gynaecological surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a fixed-effect model. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs (1316 women). Seven RCTs randomised women; the remainder randomised pelvic organs. Laparoscopy (eight RCTs) and laparotomy (11 RCTs) were the primary surgical techniques. Indications for surgery included myomectomy (seven RCTs), ovarian surgery (five RCTs), pelvic adhesions (five RCTs), endometriosis (one RCT), and mixed gynaecological surgery (one RCT). The sole indication for surgery in three of the RCTs was infertility. Thirteen RCTs reported commercial funding; the rest did not state their source of funding. No studies reported our primary outcomes of pelvic pain and live birth rate. Oxidised regenerated cellulose versus no treatment at laparoscopy or laparotomy (13 RCTs) At second-look laparoscopy, we are uncertain whether oxidised regenerated cellulose at laparoscopy reduced the incidence of de novo adhesions (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, 3 RCTs, 360 participants; I² = 75%; very low-quality evidence) or of re-formed adhesions (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.41, 3 RCTs, 100 participants; I² = 36%; very low-quality evidence). At second-look laparoscopy, we are uncertain whether oxidised regenerated cellulose affected the incidence of de novo adhesions after laparotomy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25, 1 RCT, 271 participants; very low-quality evidence). However, the incidence of re-formed adhesions may have been reduced in the intervention group (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.55, 6 RCTs, 554 participants; I² = 41%; low-quality evidence). No studies reported results on pelvic pain, live birth rate, adhesion score, or clinical pregnancy rate. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene versus oxidised regenerated cellulose at gynaecological surgery (two RCTs) We are uncertain whether expanded polytetrafluoroethylene reduced the incidence of de novo adhesions at second-look laparoscopy (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.41, 38 participants; very low-quality evidence). We are also uncertain whether expanded polytetrafluoroethylene resulted in a lower adhesion score (out of 11) (MD -3.79, 95% CI -5.12 to -2.46, 62 participants; very low-quality evidence) or a lower risk of re-formed adhesions (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.80, 23 participants; very low-quality evidence) when compared with oxidised regenerated cellulose. No studies reported results regarding pelvic pain, live birth rate, or clinical pregnancy rate. Collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol versus no treatment at gynae ological surgery (one RCT) Evidence suggests that collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol may reduce the incidence of adhesions at second-look laparoscopy (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.77, 47 participants; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol and glycerol improved clinical pregnancy rate (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.38 to 23.48, 39 participants; very low-quality evidence). One study reported adhesion scores but reported them as median scores rather than mean scores (median score 0.8 in the treatment group vs median score 1.2 in the control group) and therefore could not be included in the meta-analysis. The reported P value was 0.230, and no evidence suggests a difference between treatment and control groups. No studies reported results regarding pelvic pain or live birth rate. In total, 15 of the 19 RCTs included in this review reported adverse events. No events directly attributed to adhesion agents were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence on the effects of barrier agents used during pelvic surgery on pelvic pain or live birth rate in women of reproductive age because no trial reported these outcomes. It is difficult to draw credible conclusions due to lack of evidence and the low quality of included studies. Given this caveat, low-quality evidence suggests that collagen membrane with polyethylene glycol plus glycerol may be more effective than no treatment in reducing the incidence of adhesion formation following pelvic surgery. Low-quality evidence also shows that oxidised regenerated cellulose may reduce the incidence of re-formation of adhesions when compared with no treatment at laparotomy. It is not possible to draw conclusions on the relative effectiveness of these interventions due to lack of evidence. No adverse events directly attributed to the adhesion agents were reported. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Common limitations were imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. Most studies were commercially funded, and publication bias could not be ruled out.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The WHO classifies papillary glioneuronal tumor (PGNT) as Grade I, however, several malignant cases have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To establish the clinical and prognostic characteristics of PGNT. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and institutional databases were queried for patient-level reports of PGNT, resulting in 138 cases. Descriptive and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted. Threshold of significance was 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 26.9 (SD: 16.3), with a higher incidence in males (1.42:1). High Ki-67 (≥5) index tumors were more likely to exhibit perilesional edema and ring enhancement on MRI, trending toward significance (p = 0.114, p = 0.113, respectively). Tumors with a high Ki-67 index were more likely to be treated with subtotal resection (STR) than with gross-total resection (GTR), (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.006), and with radiation therapy, (χ(2), p = 0.010), as compared to tumors with a low index (<5). Five years post-treatment, PGNT had a progression-free survival (PFS) of 85.9 (SE: 3.9). Male patients experienced a higher 5-year PFS (94.0, SE: 3.4) than female patients (74.8, SE: 7.8), (Mantel-Cox, p = 0.002). Two-year PFS was higher after GTR (91.9, SE: 3.6) compared to after STR (46.7, SE: 21.4), (Mantel-Cox, p < 0.001). A low Ki-67 index resulted in a higher PFS (94.8, SE: 3.6) than a high Ki-67 index (55.6, SE: 12.9), (Mantel-Cox, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: PGNT is a benign tumor of young adults, but can present atypically as high-grade. Male gender, low cellular proliferation, and maximal surgical resection are positive prognostic indicators for PGNT.

AB  - Introduction: The use of neo-adjuvant radiotherapy (NRT) has been proven effective at improving cancer related outcome measures, including overall-survival (OS) in the management of solid cancers. However, its utilisation in breast cancer has not been explored to the extent of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The evidence for the application of NRT in breast cancer is evaluated. Methods: PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library databases were searched systematically in August 2020 for studies that addressed the role of NRT in the treatment of breast cancer. Studies were deemed eligible if they reported on objective outcome measurements of OS, disease free-survival (DFS) or pathological complete response (pCR) and attained a satisfactory quality assessment. Findings: A total of 23 studies reported upon 3,766 patients who had received NRT of which 3,233 also received NAC concurrently (neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (NCRT)). The pCR values ranged from 14% to 42%, 5-year DFS 61.4% to 81% and 5-year OS 71.6% to 84.2%. Complications were confined to radiation dermatitis with no cases of implant loss reported during breast reconstruction. The application of NRCT alone showed no significant difference in OS or DFS compared to NCRT followed by surgery. Interpretation: Numbers of patients receiving exclusively NRT is small. However, NCRT is oncologically safe with a low side-effect profile including preceding breast reconstruction. Potential benefits include precise cancer volume targeting, chemosensitisation, elimination of delays in adjuvant therapies and alternatives to chemotherapy in oestrogen receptor positive patients. These factors warrant further exploration within randomised controlled-trials.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to review and analyze studies focusing on the efficacy of metronidazole in reducing the risk of preterm birth and the safety of metronidazole taking into account the different doses, duration of treatment and routes of administration. Study designs: Embase, Cochrane Library and PubMed were searched up to 29 July 2019 to identify studies assessing metronidazole exposure during pregnancy. Additional studies were identified from reference lists of retrieved papers. Measured outcomes were preterm births (<37 weeks of gestation) and associated delivery outcomes such as spontaneous abortions (<= 20 weeks of gestation), stillbirths (>=20 weeks of gestation) and low birth weight (<2500 g) irrespective of the period of exposure and major malformations after first-trimester exposure. Overall effect estimates for RCTs and observational studies were calculated using the random-effects model and pooled using Risk Ratios (RR) and Odds Ratios (OR) respectively. ROB-2 and ROBINS-I tool were used to assess Risk of Bias for RCTs and observational studies, respectively. Results: Twenty-four studies (17 observational studies and 7 RCTs) were selected. Pooled RR was 1.10 (95 % CI 0.78-1.55; n = 7; I<sup>2</sup> = 72 %) for preterm birth. Subgroup analysis found RR 1.67; 95 % CI 1.07-2.62; n = 3; I2 = 32 %) for treatment duration of <=3 days among women with a previous preterm delivery. Pooled OR for spontaneous abortion was 1.72 (95 % CI 1.40-2.12; n = 5; I<sup>2</sup> = 72 %) and 1.15 (95 % CI 0.98-1.34; n = 12; I<sup>2</sup> = 25 %) for major malformations. After exclusion of studies with critical risk of bias, pooled OR were 1.7 (1.42-2.04; n = 3; I<sup>2</sup> = 19 %) and 1.13 (0.93-1.36; n = 9; I<sup>2</sup> = 28 %) respectively. Among several specific malformations analyzed, only congenital hydrocephaly was significantly increased at 4.06 (95 % CI 1.75-9.42; n = 2; I2 = 0%). Conclusions: Data do not confirm the efficacy of metronidazole in reducing the risk of preterm birth and associated delivery outcomes. Further research is required to confirm the effect of high dose and short duration of metronidazole treatment on preterm birth among the high-risk group. Regarding the increased odds of spontaneous abortion, RCTs are required to assess the role of the underlying infection. The need for further studies to confirm the risk of congenital hydrocephaly is paramount.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Because of the immune modulatory effects of vitamin D3 in preeclampsia, we intend to have a systematic review and meta-analysis on association of both 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OHD) level (parametric approach) and 25-OHD deficiency (non-parametric approach) with preeclampsia. As well, for the parametric part, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used Web of Science, PubMed and Science Direct data bases through searching in titles. Google Scholar search engine was used in order to find missing papers. Finally 23 studies were imported. Both random and fixed models were reported. RESULTS: Based on the forest plot, lower levels of 25-OHD were significantly associated with risk of preeclampsia (fixed and random P < 0.001). Based on the forest plot, vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD < 20 ng/ml) was significantly associated with risk of preeclampsia (fixed P < 0.0001; random P = 0.0029; fixed OR = 1.33; random OR = 1.54). Based on ROC curve results, we found 2 cutoffs of 10.60 and 20.05 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Women with vitamin D deficiency at cutoff 20 ng/ml are more at risk of preeclampsia. This association can be specific up to 90% at 10.60 ng/ml cutoff. Treatment of vitamin D deficiency is necessary before pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psychoeducation is an evidence-based therapeutic intervention for women that provide information, support for a better understanding and coping with fear of childbirth (FOC). Although there have been some studies examining the effects of psychoeducation on FOC and cesarean section (CS), there is no high quality evidence. This systematic review and meta-analysis study aimed to investigate the effects of psychoeducation on FOC and CS rate. METHODS: Literature research was performed in CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct, OVID, Medline, Science Citation Index (Web of Science) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until April 2018. This study is based on the recommendations of the Cochrane guidelines. The analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Program Version 3. RESULTS: Four randomized controlled studies and three non-randomized controlled studies were selected; six studies were combined for FOC and four studies were combined for CS rate. Meta-analysis revealed that psychoeducation is effective in reducing pregnant women's FOC (hedges' g 0.59, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.46-0.72, p = .000; 931 women) and the CS rate (Odds Ratio 1.730, 95% CI 1.285-2.330, p = .000; 682 women). CONCLUSION: This study provides sufficient evidence that psychoeducation is an effective to reduce FOC and CS rate.

AB  - Soy may be a suitable food for anti-obesity efforts because of its high protein and isoflavone content. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate potential effects of soy and soy isoflavones on weight, waist circumference, and fat mass. PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched. Twenty-four trials with soy and 17 trials with isoflavones passed the eligibility stage. According to the results, soy showed no overall statistically significant effect on weight, waist circumference, or fat mass, but a significant increasing effect on weight was observed in some circumstances: for instance, in obese subjects [mean difference (MD): 0.80 kg; 95% CI: 0.15, 1.45 kg; P = 0.02], with ingestions of >=40 g soy protein/d (MD: 0.94 kg; 95% CI: 0.11, 1.77 kg; P = 0.03), with short-term applications (1-3 mo) (MD: 0.45 kg; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.86 kg; P = 0.03), and when soy was compared with meat (MD: 0.36 kg; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.64 kg; P = 0.03) and whey protein (MD: 1.53 kg; 95% CI: 0.10, 2.96 kg; P = 0.04). In contrast to the effects of soy on weight, soy significantly decreased waist circumference in older ages (MD: -0.36 cm; 95% CI: -0.71, -0.01 cm; P = 0.04), in women (MD: -0.32 cm; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.08 cm; P = 0.01), and at doses of <40 g soy protein/d (MD: -0.31 cm; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.05 cm; P = 0.02). Isoflavone studies, conducted only in women, showed that isoflavones may reduce body mass index (BMI; in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (MD: -0.26; 95% CI: -0.55, 0.04; P = 0.085), especially in dosages <100 mg/d (MD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.06; P = 0.02) and in intervention periods of 2-6 mo (MD: -0.28; 95% CI: -0.56, 0.00; P = 0.053), but no effect was observed in higher doses or longer intervention periods. Also, a trend for reduced BMI after consumption of isoflavones was observed in Caucasians (MD: -0.35; 95% CI: -0.74, 0.04; P = 0.08). Overall, results showed that, although soy is the major source of isoflavones, soy and isoflavones may have different impacts on weight status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thyroid disease is the second most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Subclinical hypothyroidism is diagnosed by an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration with a normal concentration of free thyroxine hormone. Autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is diagnosed by the presence of thyroid autoantibodies, regardless of thyroid hormone levels. Thyroxine may be a useful treatment for subfertile women with these two specific types of thyroid disease for improving pregnancy outcomes during assisted reproduction. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and harms of levothyroxine replacement in subfertile women with subclinical hypothyroidism or with normal thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity (euthyroid autoimmune thyroid disease, or euthyroid ATD) undergoing assisted reproduction. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and two trials registers together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify studies. We searched for all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing thyroxine with no treatment or placebo, without language restrictions, from inception to 8 April 2019, and in consultation with the Cochrane CGF Information Specialist. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment, meaning both in vitro fertilisation and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, with a history of subfertility and with subclinical hypothyroidism or with euthyroid ATD. We excluded women with a previously known clinical hypothyroidism or already taking thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine. RCTs compared thyroxine (levothyroxine) with either placebo or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary review outcomes were live birth and adverse events of thyroxine; our secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy and miscarriage. MAIN RESULTS: The review included four studies with 820 women. The included studies were of overall low risk of bias. Using GRADE methodology, we assessed the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes of this review to be very low- to low-quality evidence. Evidence was downgraded for imprecision as it was based on single, small trials with wide confidence intervals (CI). We were able to include data from three of the four included studies.In one study of women with both subclinical hypothyroidism and positive or negative anti-TPO antibodies (autoimmune disease), the evidence suggested that thyroxine replacement may have improved live birth rate (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.21; 1 RCT, n = 64; low-quality evidence) and it may have led to similar miscarriage rates (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.98; 1 RCT, n = 64; low-quality evidence). The evidence suggested that women with both subclinical hypothyroidism and positive or negative anti-TPO antibodies would have a 25% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and that the chance of a live birth in these women using thyroxine would be between 27% and 100%.In women with normal thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity (euthyroid ATD), treatment with thyroxine replacement compared with placebo or no treatment may have led to similar live birth rates (risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.29; 2 RCTs, number of participants (n) = 686; I2 = 46%; low-quality evidence) and miscarriage rates (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.46, 2 RCTs, n = 686, I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). The evidence suggested that women with normal thyroid function and thyroid autoimmunity would have a 31% chance of a live birth with placebo or no treatment, and that the chance of a live birth in these women using thyroxine would be between 26% and 40%.Adverse events were rarely reported. One RCT reported 0/32 in the thyroxine replacement group and 1/32 preterm births in the control group in women diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and positive or negative anti-TPO an ibodies. One RCT reported 21/300 preterm births in the thyroxine replacement group and 19/300 preterm births in the control group in women diagnosed with positive anti-TPO antibodies. None of the RCTs reported on other maternal pregnancy complications, foetal complications or adverse effects of thyroxine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We could draw no clear conclusions in this systematic review due to the very low to low quality of the evidence reported.

AB  - Objective: Teriparatide has been increasingly utilized in the management of osteoporosis. The efficacy of low and high dose teriparatide on lumbar spine bone mineral density, vertebral fracture incidence and pain is unknown. We sought to determine the efficacy of teriparatide on these patient-important outcomes using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL) was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate teriparatide to any comparator for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were used by two independent reviewers to assess the strength and quality of evidence. Results: A total of 20 studies (n = 6024) were included in this review, with 2855 patients receiving teriparatide and 3169 patients receiving placebo or control treatment. A teriparatide dose of 20 mug/day increased lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.34 standard deviation (SD) units higher (95% CI 0.19-0.48 SDs higher) in comparison to placebo. Relative to anti-resorptive agents, 20 mug/day of teriparatide had a range from 0.14 SD units to 0.96 SD units higher (95% CI, 0.08 SDs lower to 0.36 SDs higher, CI, 0.33-1.59 SDs higher, respectively). 20 mug/day teriparatide had a significant effect on pain severity to placebo or control (SMD 0.80, 95% CI, 1.16-0.43 SDs lower) and also decreased the incidence of vertebral fractures compared to placebo (relative risk 0.31, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.46). Arthralgia and extremity pain incidence were also calculated; there were 15 and 8 fewer events per 1000 patients with the use of 20 mug/day of teriparatide compared to placebo or control, respectively. Conclusion: High quality evidence supports the utilization of teriparatide 20 mug/day dose to significantly improve lumbar spine BMD and decrease incidence of vertebral fractures and pain severity relative to all comparators. 40 mug/day dose of teriparatide demonstrated significantly better results with prolonged treatment. This data is valuable for clinicians involved in the care of this growing demographic of patients. Further investigation on the safety and efficacy of teriparatide in higher doses for the long-term treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women should be conducted through high-quality clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare outcomes with radial vs femoral approach in female patients undergoing coronary angiography. BACKGROUND: Women undergoing cardiac procedures have increased risk of bleeding and vascular complications, but are under-represented in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving coronary angiography. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of RCTs comparing outcomes in women undergoing angiography with radial vs femoral approaches. The primary outcome was non-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) related bleeding at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE; a composite of death, stroke or myocardial infarction), vascular complications, procedure duration, and access-site crossover. RESULTS: Four studies (n = 6041 female patients) met the inclusion criteria. In female patients undergoing coronary angiography, radial access decreased non-CABG related bleeding (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.72; P<.001), MACCE (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.93; P=.01), vascular complications (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.75; P<.001) with no significant difference in procedure time (mean difference, 0.04; 95% CI, -0.97 to 0.89; P=.93). There was an increase in access-site crossover using the radial approach (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.24-3.63; P<.001). Patients undergoing radial approach were more likely to prefer radial access for the next procedure (OR, 6.96; 95% CI, 5.70-8.50; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: In female patients undergoing coronary angiography or intervention, the radial approach is associated with decreased bleeding, MACCE, and vascular complications. These data suggest that radial access should be the preferred approach for women.

AB  - Background Maternal chronic hypertension is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Previous studies examined the association between either chronic hypertension or antihypertensive treatment and adverse pregnancy outcomes. We aimed to synthesize the evidence on the effect of chronic hypertension/antihypertensive treatment on adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods and Results Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched; we included observational studies and assessed the effect of race/ethnicity, where possible, following a registered protocol (CRD42019120088). Random-effects meta-analyses were used. A total of 81 studies were identified on chronic hypertension, and a total of 16 studies were identified on antihypertensive treatment. Chronic hypertension was associated with higher odds of preeclampsia (adjusted odd ratio [aOR], 5.43; 95% CI, 3.85-7.65); cesarean section (aOR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.6-2.16); maternal mortality (aOR, 4.80; 95% CI, 3.04-7.58); preterm birth (aOR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.96-2.53); stillbirth (aOR, 2.32; 95% CI, 2.22-2.42); and small for gestational age (SGA) (aOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.6-2.40). Subgroup analyses indicated that maternal race/ethnicity does not influence the observed associations. Women with chronic hypertension on antihypertensive treatment (versus untreated) had higher odds of SGA (aOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.38-2.50). Conclusions Chronic hypertension is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and these associations appear to be independent of maternal race/ethnicity. In women with chronic hypertension, those on treatment had a higher risk of SGA, although the number of studies was limited. This could result from a direct effect of the treatment or because severe hypertension during pregnancy is a risk factor for SGA and women with severe hypertension are more likely to be treated. The effect of antihypertensive treatment on SGA needs to be further tested with large randomized controlled trials.

AB  - Limited evidence on treatment options for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has led to considerable variation in health care practices. We aimed to compare the effects of metformin and/or oral contraceptive pills (OCP) in combination with pioglitazone, spironolactone, flutamide, and lifestyle interventions among adolescents aged 11 to 19 years with PCOS. Literature searches were performed in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception through December 2018, with no language restriction. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, assessed full text eligibility, and extracted information from eligible trials. Evidence was synthesized through network meta-analyses (NMA) using a Bayesian random-effects approach. We identified 37 randomized controlled trials, in which 2400 patients were randomized. NMA showed no statistically important difference among all interventions to improve menstrual regulation or body mass index. Moderate-quality evidence showed hirsutism scores were reduced by multiple interventions that included single and combination medications namely; lifestyle intervention, metformin, OCP, spironolactone, pioglitazone, metformin-OCP, metformin-spironolactone, and metformin-flutamide against placebo. Moderate-quality evidence showed OCP results in more dysglycemia compared to metformin (odds ratio, 2.98; 95% credible interval, 1.02-8.96), no intervention resulted in dysglycemia reduction. In conclusion, metformin and OCP as monotherapy or in combination with other interventions compared with placebo can reduce hirsutism scores, but none of these medications lead to effective menstrual cycle regulation or weight reduction. However, the use of OCP leads to worse cardiometabolic risk factors. Further research into new treatment options is urgently needed. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42015016148.

AB  - PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: Fatigue has a negative impact on the quality of life of patients with cancer. The aim of this review is to evaluate studies on the effectiveness of exercise interventions in reducing fatigue in women with gynecologic cancer. LITERATURE SEARCH: The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines using the CINAHL®, MEDLINE®, EMBASE, PsycINFO®, and Cochrane Library databases. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme was used for quality assessment. DATA EVALUATION: Five studies met the inclusion criteria: three randomized, controlled trials and two single-arm trials. SYNTHESIS: Evidence suggests that exercise interventions result in significant reductions in fatigue in women with gynecologic cancer. However, the current evidence is limited. Additional studies are required to address the dose-dependent outcomes of exercise interventions on fatigue in women with gynecologic cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings support the positive effects of exercise interventions in reducing fatigue in women with gynecologic cancer, suggesting that healthcare professionals may consider including exercise programs into management plans for this population.

AB  - Various management approaches have been developed to treat symptoms and prevent complications of the cesarean diverticulum. This systematic review aims to report the outcomes and fertility-related effects of hysteroscopy on women with myometrial scar defects after the cesarean section. Following the formulation of the patient/population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) criteria, a systematic search was conducted on seven databases. Finally, a total of 18 studies were included for this systematic review and meta-analysis. All of the included patients suffered from post-cesarean section scars and presented with abnormal bleeding, pain, or secondary infertility. The overall pooled symptomatic improvement rate was 78.83% (95% CI: 72.46-85.76%); however, there was significant heterogeneity among the analyzed studies (I2=87%; p-value: <0.001) and a significant risk of bias (p-value: <0.001). The overall resolution/improvement rate after adjusting for possible bias was higher, 92.82% (95% CI: 85.17-100%). The overall pregnancy rate was 69.77% (95% CI: 59.03-82.48%), while in the individual studies the rates varied, ranging from 25% to 80%. Nevertheless, there was moderate heterogeneity among the included studies (I2=56%; p-value=0.011). In contrast, there was no significant risk of bias among the included studies (p-value=0.100). Furthermore, the meta-regression analyses did not show any significant effect of different follow-up durations on the overall effect size for both outcomes. In conclusion, there is still a need for high-quality, comparative studies with larger sample sizes and long-term follow-up periods to draw firm conclusions. Moreover, future studies should consider the minimum myometrial thickness that is sufficient to complete a healthy pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether routine third-trimester ultrasounds in low-risk pregnancies decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with regular antenatal care with serial fundal height measurements. DATA SOURCES: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials to identify relevant studies published from inception to October 2019. The databases used were Ovid, PubMed, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials using a combination of key words related to "third trimester ultrasound" and "low-risk." STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included all randomized control trials of singleton, nonanomalous low-risk pregnancies that were randomized to either one or more third-trimester ultrasounds (ultrasound group) or serial fundal height (fundal height group). Exclusion criteria were patients with multiple gestations, maternal medical complications, or fetal abnormalities requiring a third-trimester ultrasound. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The primary outcome was the rate of perinatal death. The secondary outcomes were rates of fetal growth restriction, suspected large for gestational age, polyhydramnios, oligohydramnios, fetal anomalies, antenatal interventions, stillbirth, neonatal death, cesarean delivery, induction of labor, and other neonatal outcomes. This meta-analysis was performed with the use of the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird to produce relative risk or mean difference with a corresponding 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: A total of 7 randomized control trials with 23,643 participants (12,343 in the ultrasound group vs 11,300 in the fundal height group) were included. The total rate of perinatal death was similar among the groups (41 of 11,322 [0.4%] vs 34 of 10,285 [0.3%]; relative risk, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.89). The rate of fetal growth restriction was higher in the ultrasound group (763 of 10,388 [7%] vs 337 of 9021 [4%]; relative risk, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-2.39) and the rate of suspected large for gestational age (1060 of 3513 [30%] vs 375 of 3558 [11%]; relative risk, 2.84; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.2). Polyhydramnios was also significantly higher in the ultrasound group than the fundal height group (18 of 323 [6%] vs 4 of 322 [1%] relative risk, 3.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-11). The rates of the remainder of the secondary outcomes were similar among the groups. CONCLUSION: Routine third-trimester ultrasounds do not decrease the rate of perinatal death compared with serial fundal height in low-risk pregnancies. Ideally, an adequately powered trial is warranted to determine whether perinatal mortality in the fundal height group can be reduced by one-third with third-trimester ultrasound.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased fracture risk. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of different classes of glucose-lowering drugs on fracture risk in patients with type 2 DM. The heterogeneity of the included studies did not allow formal statistical analyses. RECENT FINDINGS: Sixty studies were included in the review. Metformin, dipeptidylpeptidase-IV inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2-inhibitors do not appear to increase fracture risk. Results for insulin and sulphonylureas were more disparate, although there may be an increased fracture risk related to hypoglycemia and falls with these treatments. Glitazones were consistently associated with increased fracture risk in women, although the evidence was sparser in men. New glucose-lowering drugs are continuously being developed and better understanding of these is leading to changes in prescription patterns. Our findings warrant continued research on the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on fracture risk, elucidating the class-specific effects of these drugs.

AB  - PURPOSE: Around 10-30 % of patients are dissatisfied with the results of their total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This review aimed to identify and evaluate the predictors of outcome measured by the three domains of health-related quality of life (pain, stiffness and function). The focus was on pre-operative psychological factors as related to other patient-related variables. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, AMED, CINAHL, PsychINFO, SciFinder, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, Lilacs, Web of Science and ScienceDirect. The quality of identified studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Cohort checklist. RESULTS: Ten studies met the eligibility criteria. From these, nine patient-related predictors of outcome were identified (depression, anxiety, age at surgery, gender (being female), medical co-morbidities, BMI, level of education, pre-operative pain severity and pre-operative knee function). Greater anxiety, pre-operative pain and function were the most significant factors to predict a poorer outcome of a TKA. The results of depression, gender (female), medical co-morbidities, BMI and level of education were variable among the included studies. There was very little evidence to support older age at operation as a predictor of poorer outcome. CONCLUSION: Patients experiencing high levels of pain before surgery should be informed of the chances of improvement by having a TKA. A validated psychological screening tool that separates depression and anxiety is recommended as part of the pre-operative assessment stage. Patients presenting with symptoms of depression and anxiety should be identified and consulted before a TKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydralazine, labetalol, and nifedipine are the recommended first-line treatments for severe hypertension in pregnancy. While all three are effective, there is a lack of sufficient evidence regarding their comparative safety and efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the comparative safety and efficacy of the first-line treatment options for severe hypertension in pregnancy. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 31, 2018 was conducted. RCTs in pregnancy comparing a first-line antihypertensive agent to another first-line agent for the treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy. Screening, data abstraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. To estimate relative effects from all available evidence, a Bayesian network meta-analysis with vague priors was conducted. MAIN RESULTS: Of the 1330 publications identified, 17 RCTs comprised of a total of 1591 women met our selection criteria. For successful treatment of severe hypertension, nifedipine was found to be superior to hydralazine (OR 4.13 [95% CrI 1.01-20.75]) but not labetalol (OR 3.43 [95% CrI 0.94-19.95]). This was not associated with an increased risk for caesarean delivery or maternal side effects. There was no significant difference between labetalol and hydralazine. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis, maternity care providers should feel comfortable initiating management of severe hypertension in pregnancy using oral nifedipine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO) is associated with variable outcomes. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated the mortality after VA ECMO across multiple etiologies of cardiogenic shock (CS). METHODS: In June 2019, we performed a systematic search selecting observational studies with ≥10 adult patients reporting on short-term mortality (30-day or mortality at discharge) after initiation of VA ECMO by CS etiology published after 2009. We performed meta-analyses using random effect models and used metaregression to evaluate mortality across CS etiology. RESULTS: We included 306 studies (29,289 patients): 25 studies on after heart transplantation (HTx) (771 patients), 13 on myocarditis (906 patients), 33 on decompensated heart failure (HF) (3,567 patients), 64 on after cardiotomy shock (8,231 patients), 10 on pulmonary embolism (PE) (221 patients), 80 on acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (7,774 patients), and 113 on after cardiac arrest [CA] (7,814 patients). With moderate certainty on effect estimates, we observed significantly different mortality estimates for various etiologies (p < 0.001), which is not explained by differences in age and sex across studies: 35% (95% CI: 29-42) for after HTx, 40% (95% CI: 33-46) for myocarditis, 53% (95% CI: 46-59) for HF, 52% (95% CI: 38-66) for PE, 59% (95% CI: 56-63) for cardiotomy, 60% (95% CI: 57-64) for AMI, 64% (95% CI: 59-69) for post‒in-hospital CA, and 76% (95% CI: 69-82) for post-out‒of-hospital CA. Univariable metaregression showed that variation in mortality estimates within etiology group was partially explained by population age, proportion of females, left ventricle venting, and CA. CONCLUSIONS: Using an overall estimate of mortality for patients with CS requiring VA ECMO is inadequate given the differential outcomes by etiology. To further refine patient selection and management to improve outcomes, additional studies evaluating patient characteristics impacting outcomes by specific CS etiology are needed.

AB  - Clozapine is one of the most widely used antipsychotics for treating psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This drug, however, is associated with adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and blood dyscrasias. The manifestations of mental illness may differ between men and women. Yet, there is little evidence on the influence of sex on treatment response or the occurrence of AEs. To fill this gap of knowledge, we carried out a systematic review of the literature on sex differences in the effectiveness and adverse effects of clozapine. Scant evidence has been published on differences in effectiveness of clozapine between men and women. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, this issue has only been addressed in a published study. Regarding adverse effects, males have been reported to be more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities such as cholesterol or triglycerides, hypertension, and cardiovascular risk, while females are at a higher risk for gaining weight, developing diabetes, and needing laxatives. Nevertheless, given the scarcity of sex-based studies on this drug, further studies are needed to explore sex-based differences, as the results obtained may be crucial to clinical practice and help improve the quality of life of patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Anti-osteoporotic drug (AOD) trials have variabilities in duration and fracture risks. This study evaluated AOD's versus controls regarding reduction in relative rates (rr) and rate differences (rd) of vertebral and hip fractures and comparative costs. METHODS: Primary randomized-controlled trials (RCT's) of AOD's in post-menopausal women with documentation of vertebral fracture rates (VFR) or hip fracture rates (HFR) were extracted from meta-analyses and PubMed through February 2021. Direct and indirect meta-analysis and meta-regression analyzed fracture reductions. RESULTS: There were 24 RCT's of drug-versus-placebo (73,862 women) and 10 drug-versus-drug trials. Reduction in rr of VFR were significant for anti-resorptive (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, denosumab, raloxifene) and anabolic (teriparatide, abaloparatide, romosozumab) drugs. Denosumab, teriparatide and abaloparatide were more effective in reducing VFR compared to oral bisphosphates (all p <0.05) but not to zoledronate. Reduction in HFR were significant for alendronate, denosumab and zoledronate (all p <0.05), without significant differences among drugs. Anabolic drugs did not show significant HFR reduction. Meta-regression of rd's allowed for calculation of costs per vertebral fracture prevented, which were estimated at >$100,000 for anabolic drugs and between $2,289-$28,947 for anti-resorptive drugs. Drug-versus-drug trials were underpowered to demonstrate changes. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests goal-directed, cost-effective therapy relative to a patient's risk for vertebral and hip fractures. Anabolic drugs are better at preventing vertebral fractures compared to oral bisphosphonates. Anabolic drugs are not superior to zoledronate or denosumab, and at substantially higher cost. In comparing drugs which prevented hip fractures, there was no statistical benefit of any drug.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is seen in 0.5%-5% of fertile and 25%-40% of infertile women. To investigate this conflict between gynecologists that ovarian endometriomas should be removed or not before making any decision about pregnancy among infertile women, the authors decided to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effect of various available therapeutic methods and notice the impact of these options on women's pregnancy rate. METHODS: This review is based on PRISMA recommendations with an electronic search using the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, etc, from 2000 to 2018, in the English language. The studies compare pregnancy rate based on four different treatment types of OMAs between infertile women: (surgery + ART, surgery + spontaneous pregnancy, aspiration ± sclerotherapy + ART, and ART alone). MAIN FINDINGS: At least eight prospective studies were included, in which 553 infertile women were compared in terms of treatment methods of OMAs before trying to become pregnant. CONCLUSION: Treatments are usually based on the patient's clinical condition and must be individual, with the purpose of relieving pain, improving fertility, or both. The authors do not have not any significant difference between our four groups of study; however, the success of surgical procedure compared to other methods was higher and the success of ART alone was the least.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endometrial cancer uncommonly presents at an advanced stage, and little prospective evidence exists to guide management. We aimed to summarize evidence on primary cytoreductive surgery (PCS) in the treatment of advanced stage endometrial cancer. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched from inception to September 11, 2020, using search terms representing the themes "endometrial cancer," "advanced stage," and "primary cytoreductive surgery". STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We selected for English full-text reports including ≥10 stage IV patients undergoing PCS for advanced stage endometrial cancer and reporting outcomes of incidence and survival by extent of residual disease after cytoreduction. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened studies, with disagreements resolved by a third. Data were extracted using a standardized form. Percent of cases reaching maximal (no gross residual disease; NGRD) and optimal (<1 cm or <2 cm residual disease) cytoreduction were assessed by summing binomials proportions, and association with survival assessed with inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis of logarithmic hazard ratios. RESULTS: From 1,219 unique records, we selected 34 studies for inclusion. Studies consisted of single or multi-institutional cohorts of patients collected over 6-24 years, including varying mixes of histologies (endometrioid/serous/clear cell/carcinosarcoma) and stages (III/IV). In meta-analysis of extent of residual disease after PCS, we found 52.1% of cases reached NGRD (n=18 studies, 1,329 patients), and 75% reached <1 cm (n=27 studies, 2,343 patients). The proportion of cytoreduction to both thresholds was lower for studies of stage IV vs. stage III-IV disease (41.4% vs. 69.8% NGRD, 63.2% vs. 82.2% <1 cm), but did not vary notably by histology. In meta-analysis of reported hazard ratios (HRs), submaximal (any gross residual disease vs. NGRD), and suboptimal (≥1 cm vs. <1 cm) cytoreduction were associated with worse progression-free survival (submaximal: HR=2.16, 95%CI 1.45-3.21; I2=68%; suboptimal: HR=2.55, 95%CI 1.93-3.37 I2=63%) and overall survival (submaximal: HR=2.57, 95%CI 2.13-3.10; I2=1%; suboptimal: HR=2.62, 95%CI 2.20-3.11; I2=15%). Sensitivity analyses limiting to high quality studies demonstrated consistent results. CONCLUSIONS: Among cases of advanced stage endometrial cancer undergoing PCS, a significant proportion of patients are left with residual disease, which is associated with worse survival. Further investigation of the roles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and PCS in prospective trials is warranted in this population.

AB  - Psychological interventions for sleep-wake disorders have medium-to-large effect sizes, however whether behavioral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeted underserved populations or addressed contextual and cultural factors is unknown. We conducted a systematic review to: (a) examine sociodemographic characteristics of behavioral RCTs for prevalent sleep-wake disorders and sleep disturbances that targeted undeserved adults, (b) identify types of cultural adaptations (surface-level, deep-level), and (c) describe intervention effectiveness on primary sleep outcomes. Overall, 6.97% of RCTs (56 studies) targeted underserved groups (veterans, women, racial/ethnic minorities, low socioeconomic status, disability status); 64.29% made surface-level and/or deep-level cultural adaptations. There was a lack of racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, sexual orientation, and linguistic diversity. Most cultural adaptations were made to behavioral therapies, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). Surface-level cultural adaptations to the delivery modality and setting were most common. Deep-level cultural adaptations of the content and core intervention components were also typical. Intervention effectiveness varied by type of adapted intervention and participant population. RCTs of adapted CBT-I interventions among participants with a definite sleep disorder or sleep disturbance showed consistent significant reductions in adverse sleep outcomes versus control. These findings have important implications for the use of cultural adaptations to address behavioral sleep medicine disparities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: We aim to compare total versus subtotal abdominal hysterectomy regarding urinary and bowel symptoms and pelvic organ prolapse at long-term follow-up. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on the MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane CENTRAL and SCOPUS databases and conference abstracts (AAGL, AUGS, ICS) from inception up to November 2017. We included randomized trials comparing total versus subtotal hysterectomy for benign conditions that evaluated pelvic floor symptoms over 5 years of follow-up. Risk of bias and GRADE assessment for quality of evidence were performed. RESULTS: We included four studies involving 566 participants with follow-up ranging from 5 to 14 years. Women who underwent total hysterectomy presented lower risk of reported urinary incontinence [RR 0.74 (CI = 0.58, 0.94) i<sup>2</sup> 0%; p = 0.02] and stress urinary incontinence [RR 0.84 (CI = 0.71, 0.99) i<sup>2</sup> 0%; p = 0.04] than those who had subtotal hysterectomy. The events urinary frequency, urge incontinence, incomplete bladder emptying, pelvic organ prolapse, incontinence of stool and constipation did not favor one procedure over another in the long term (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient-reported urinary incontinence and stress urinary incontinence events favored total hysterectomy over subtotal hysterectomy up to 14-year long-term follow-up.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a greatly increased fracture risk compared with the general population. Gonadal hormones have an important influence on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk, and hormone therapies can significantly improve these outcomes. Gonadal dysfunction is a frequent finding in patients with CKD; yet, little is known about the impact of gonadal hormones in the pathogenesis and treatment of bone health in patients with CKD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of gonadal hormones and hormone therapies on bone outcomes in men and women with CKD. METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and clinical trial registries were systematically searched from inception to February 14, 2018 for studies that assessed gonadal hormones or hormone treatments with bone outcomes in patients with CKD stage 3-5D. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of search results according to inclusion criteria and assessed study quality and risk of bias using validated assessment tools. RECENT FINDINGS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Six moderate-to-high quality observational studies showed inconsistent association between any gonadal hormone and bone outcomes, limited by significant study heterogeneity. Five moderate-high risk of bias interventional studies examined treatment with selective oestrogen receptor modulators in post-menopausal women (four using raloxifene and one bazedoxifene) and demonstrated variable effects on BMD and fracture outcomes. Meta-analysis of raloxifene treatment in post-menopausal women demonstrated improvement in lumbar spine (SMD 3.30; 95% CI 3.21-3.38) and femoral neck (SMD 3.29; 95% CI 3.21-3.36) BMD compared with placebo. Transdermal oestradiol/norethisterone in pre-menopausal women receiving dialysis (n = 1 study), demonstrated BMD improvement over 12 months. Testosterone treatment for 6 months in dialysis-dependant men (n = 1 study) did not improve BMD. There is evidence that raloxifene treatment may be beneficial in improving BMD in post-menopausal women with CKD. There is insufficient evidence for other hormone treatments in men or women. Despite high fracture rates and frequent gonadal dysfunction in patients with CKD, significant evidence gaps exist, and well-designed studies are required to specifically assess the impact of gonadal status in the pathogenesis of CKD-related bone fragility and its treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis investigated the risk of congenital anomalies among infants of human immunodeficiency virus-infected pregnant women who were exposed to antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: Cohort studies, case-control studies, randomized controlled trials, and controlled clinical trials were reviewed by searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, AIDSLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Google/Google Scholar. Methodological quality was assessed using the GRADE evaluation. A DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were used to investigate heterogeneity. RESULTS: The electronic searches yielded 765 items. After quality assessment and grading, 30 studies were suitable for metaanalysis. In total, 1,461 congenital anomalies were found among 53,186 births. Children born to women receiving combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) had an approximately 10% higher risk of developing congenital anomalies (relative risk [RR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.14). A subgroup analysis found no significant difference in the risk of congenital anomalies between cART and efavirenz users. However, zidovudine and protease inhibitor (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.19) users were found to have a 10% increased risk of congenital anomalies, and integrase inhibitor users had a 60% increase in risk (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.60 to 2.43). The subgroup results should be interpreted cautiously because of the moderate heterogeneity (I2 =58%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of protease inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, zidovudine, and newer drugs should be carefully considered in pregnant women. Further studies are needed to address environmental, nutrition, and adherence factors related to ART. Establishing a congenital anomalies surveillance system is recommended.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a common public health problem affecting pregnant women. However, the impact of MDR-TB and its medication on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes has been poorly understood and inconsistently reported. Therefore, using the available literature, we aim to determine whether MDR-TB and its medications during pregnancy impact maternal and perinatal outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Systematic searches will be conducted in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science on 10 February 2020 for studies that reported adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes due to MDR-TB and/or its medication. The search will be performed without language and time restrictions. Adverse birth outcomes include miscarriage or abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth weight, small and large for gestational age, and neonatal death. Two independent reviewers will screen search records, extract data and assess the quality of the studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale will be used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. In addition to a narrative synthesis, a random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted when sufficient data are available. I<sup>2</sup> statistics will be used to assess the heterogeneity between studies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As it will be a systematic review and meta-analysis based on previously published evidence, there will be no requirement for ethical approval. Findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at various conferences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In female cancer patients anticipating chemotherapy or radiation, oocyte retrieval for fertility should be performed as efficiently as possible to avoid postponing cancer treatments. Our objective was to compare clinical outcomes among female cancer patients who underwent a conventional early follicular phase-start ovarian stimulation cycle and those who underwent a random-start ovarian stimulation cycle. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic review of the literature was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Medline, Embase.com, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov databases were searched to identify all original research published in English through July 2020 on the topic of female cancer patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with a random or conventional start. Studies lacking a comparison group or including women who had already undergone chemotherapy at the time of ovarian stimulation were excluded. The primary author assessed all identified article titles and abstracts, and two independent reviewers assessed full-text articles and extracted data. A meta-analysis with a random-effects model was used to calculate weighted mean differences (WMDs) for outcomes of interest. The primary outcome was the number of mature (meiosis II) oocytes retrieved. Secondary outcomes included duration of stimulation, total dose of gonadotropins, total number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and number of embryos or zygotes cryopreserved. RESULTS: A total of 446 articles were screened, and 9 full-text articles (all retrospective cohort or prospective observational) were included for review. Additionally, pooled primary retrospective data from two institutions were included. In total, data from 10 studies including 1653 women were reviewed. Five studies reported the number of embryos cryopreserved, and four reported fertilization rates. Random-start cycles were slightly longer (WMD 0.57 days, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.0-1.14 days) and used more total gonadotropins (WMD 248.8 international units, 95 % CI 57.24-440.40) than conventional-start cycles. However, there were no differences in number of mature oocytes retrieved (WMD 0.41 oocytes, 95 % CI -0.84-1.66), number of total oocytes retrieved (WMD 0.90 oocytes, 95 % CI -0.21-2.02), fertilization rates (WMD -0.12, 95 % CI -1.22-0.98), or number of embryos cryopreserved (WMD 0.12 embryos, 95 %CI -0.98-1.22) between random-start and conventional-start cycles. All outcomes except for the parameter "total oocytes retrieved" yielded an I2 of over 50 %, indicating substantial heterogeneity between studies. CONCLUSION(S): Although random-start cycles may entail a longer duration of stimulation and use more total gonadotropins than conventional-start cycles, the absolute differences are small and likely do not significantly affect treatment costs. The similar numbers of mature oocytes retrieved, fertilization rates, and number of embryos cryopreserved in the two start-types suggest that they do not differ in any clinically important ways. Given that random-start cycles can be initiated quickly, they may help facilitate fertility preservation for cancer patients.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies investigated whether progestins are as effective as gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for pituitary suppression in assisted reproduction. The primary outcome was live birth rate per woman. Secondary outcomes were live birth or ongoing pregnancy per woman and per embryo transfer, ongoing pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, numbers of oocytes and metaphase-two oocytes, duration of stimulation and gonadotrophin consumption. Adverse events included miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and multiple pregnancy rates. The GRADE system was used to assess the quality of evidence. Seven studies involving a total of 2047 women were included. Three studies compared a progestin with a GnRH antagonist and four studies compared a progestin with a GnRH agonist. Most studies are non-randomized and report outcomes per embryo transfer, rather than per woman. Although progestins were similar to GnRH antagonists in effectiveness and safety parameters, they were associated with significantly higher live birth or ongoing pregnancy per embryo transfer compared with the short GnRH agonist protocol (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.91). Progestin primed stimulation lasted significantly longer (mean difference 0.61 days, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.89) and required significantly more gonadotrophins (mean difference 433.2 IU, 95% CI 311.11 to 555.19) than the short GnRH agonist protocol, but the differences were clinically negligible. Safety parameters were similar between progestins and GnRH agonists. In conclusion, progestins can effectively prevent premature ovulation in assisted reproductive technology cycles. If larger and well-designed studies confirm these findings, progestins may be an effective and low-cost alternative to GnRH analogues when a fresh embryo transfer is not planned owing to a medical indication.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: While approximately 225,000 pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgeries are performed annually in the US, there is no consensus on the optimal route for pelvic support for the initial treatment of uterovaginal prolapse (UVP). Our objective is to compare the outcomes of abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC) to vaginal pelvic support (VPS) with either uterosacral ligament suspension (USLS) or sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSF) in combination with hysterectomy for treating apical prolapse. METHODS: A systematic search was performed through March 2021. Studies comparing ASC with VPS for treatment of UVP were included in the review. The primary outcome was the rate of overall anatomic prolapse failure per studies' definition. Secondary outcomes included evaluating isolated recurrent vaginal wall prolapse, postoperative POP-Q points, total vaginal length (TVL), and Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) scores. Random effect analyses were generated utilizing R 4.0.2. RESULTS: Out of 4225 total studies, 4 met our inclusion criteria, including 226 patients in the ASC group and 199 patients in the VPS group. ASC was not found to be associated with a higher rate of vaginal wall prolapse recurrence (OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.2-2.4; P = 0.33). There was no significant difference between groups for anterior or apical vaginal wall prolapse recurrence (P = 0.58 and P = 0.97, respectively). ASC was associated with significantly longer TVL (mean difference [MD]: 1.01; 95% CI = 0.33-1.70; P = 0.02) and better POP-Q Ba scores [MD = -0.23; 95% CI = -0.37; -0.10; P = 0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: ASC and vaginal pelvic support (either USLS or SSF) have comparable anatomical outcomes. However, weak evidence of a difference in TVL and Ba was found. The strength of the evidence in this study is based on the small number of observational studies. A large, randomized trial is highly warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs) are one of the most common, severe, and life-threatening types of adverse reactions following treatment with antiseizure medications (ASMs). Some studies have reported a higher incidence of ASM-induced cADRs in females than in males. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to perform a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to compare the ASM cADR risks between females and males. METHODS: We searched the literature using three databases (EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science) between October 1998 and November 2018, later updated to October 2019. Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) observational studies that estimated the incidence of cADRs related to ASMs; (2) provided the risk or odds ratio (OR) for cADRs among female and male patients exposed to ASMs; and (3) provided information on patients' characteristics. We assessed the impact of study characteristics, publication bias, and measures to reduce bias, and performed a DerSimonian and Laird random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 28 studies in this review. Of these, seven studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, involving a total of 223,209 patients. Overall, females were more likely to develop cADRs to ASMs than males (OR 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.55-1.99). The largest differences were observed in patients prescribed lamotrigine (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.53-3.08, p < 0.001) and carbamazepine (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.02-2.60, p = 0.042). Also, the OR trended higher for phenytoin (OR 2.46, 95% CI 0.79-7.65, p = 0.12), followed by oxcarbazepine (OR 1.91, 95% CI 0.75-4.85, p = 0.18) and sodium valproate (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.12-2.99, p = 0.53), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. In the remaining 21 studies, 13 reported numerically higher risk of cADRs among females compared to male patients, and in five of these, the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirmed that females are more susceptible to cADRs induced by ASMs than males. More research is needed to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms for this difference. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO (CRD42018111943).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research recommends the development and evaluation of interventions to support women with breast cancer in returning to, or managing, work. Despite this, there has historically been a paucity of rehabilitation interventions to support women with breast cancer to maintain or return to their work role. The aim of this systematic review was to examine key characteristics of rehabilitation interventions, and their effectiveness on work outcomes for women with breast cancer, compared to usual care. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of controlled studies of rehabilitation interventions with work outcomes for women with breast cancer. Six databases were systematically searched: EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE (OVID), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Results are presented either as pooled odds ratio (OR) or pooled effect size (hedges g) between groups, with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Narrative synthesis was conducted on intervention outcomes not suitable for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Five thousand, five hundred and thirty-five studies were identified. Nine out of 28 abstracts met inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes precluded meta-analysis for most outcomes. Of the interventions included in meta-analysis, no significant differences compared to usual care were found for sick leave (2 studies (12 months); OR 1.11 (95% CI: 0.66 to 1.87), number of sick days taken (2 studies (six months); difference in effect: - 0.08, (95% CI: - 0.48 to 0.38) or working hours (2 studies (12 months); 0.19, (95% CI: - 0.20 to 0.64). Only one study, with a multidisciplinary intervention, showed a significant difference for work outcomes when compared to usual care. Work-specific content featured in three interventions only, none of which provided conclusive evidence for improvement in work outcomes. Enhanced physical and psychological sequalae, and quality of life was observed in some studies. CONCLUSION: There remains a lack of effective and methodologically rigorous rehabilitation intervention studies for breast cancer survivors. The development and evaluation of effective rehabilitation interventions to support return to work is warranted.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The risk of procedural clinical complications and the case-fatality rate (CFR) from preventive treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms varies between studies and may depend on treatment modality and risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To assess current procedural clinical 30-day complications and the CFR from endovascular treatment (EVT) and neurosurgical treatment (NST) of unruptured intracranial aneurysms and risk factors of clinical complications. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, and the Cochrane Database for studies published between January 1, 2011, and January 1, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting on clinical complications, the CFR, and risk factors, including 50 patients or more undergoing EVT or NST for saccular unruptured intracranial aneurysms after January 1, 2000, were eligible. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Per treatment modality, we analyzed clinical complication risk and the CFR with mixed-effects logistic regression models for dichotomous data. For studies reporting data on complication risk factors, we obtained risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs and pooled risk estimates with weighted random-effects models. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical complications within 30 days and the CFR. RESULTS: We included 114 studies (106 433 patients with 108 263 aneurysms). For EVT (74 studies), the pooled clinical complication risk was 4.96% (95% CI, 4.00%-6.12%), and the CFR was 0.30% (95% CI, 0.20%-0.40%). Factors associated with complications from EVT were female sex (pooled OR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01-1.11]), diabetes (OR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.05-3.13]), hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.76 [95% CI, 1.3-2.37]), cardiac comorbidity (OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.53-3.37]), wide aneurysm neck (>4 mm or dome-to-neck ratio >1.5; OR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.38-2.11]), posterior circulation aneurysm (OR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.15-1.74]), stent-assisted coiling (OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.16-2.85]), and stenting (OR, 3.43 [95% CI, 1.45-8.09]). For NST (54 studies), the pooled complication risk was 8.34% (95% CI, 6.25%-11.10%) and the CFR was 0.10% (95% CI, 0.00%-0.20%). Factors associated with complications from NST were age (OR per year increase, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.02]), female sex (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.32-0.85]), coagulopathy (OR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.13-4.06]), use of anticoagulation (OR, 6.36 [95% CI, 2.55-15.85]), smoking (OR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.36-2.79]), hypertension (OR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.03-2.03]), diabetes (OR, 2.38 [95% CI, 1.54-3.67]), congestive heart failure (OR, 2.71 [95% CI, 1.57-4.69]), posterior aneurysm location (OR, 7.25 [95% CI, 3.70-14.20]), and aneurysm calcification (OR, 2.89 [95% CI, 1.35-6.18]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study identifies risk factors for procedural complications. Large data sets with individual patient data are needed to develop and validate prediction scores for absolute complication risks and CFRs from EVT and NST modalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is common in postmenopausal women. Some studies have demonstrated the usefulness of vitamin K through the action of bone-specific proteins and osteoblast and osteoclast activities. However, no systematic review had explored this aspect in postmenopausal women. Hence, this systematic review aimed to explore the effect of vitamin K2 alone or in combination with other agents (vitamin D3 or calcium) on various bone turnover markers (BTMs) and bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar were searched to identify relevant studies using specific inclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out using standardized tests, and the results were narratively synthesized and presented in the form of tables. RESULTS: Vitamin K2 was beneficial in inducing an improvement or preventing deterioration, as evidenced by the BMD and osteocalcin (OC), undercarboxylated OC (ucOC), carboxylated OC (cOC), and gamma-carboxylated OC levels. However, its effect was not conclusive when procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen, bone alkaline phosphatase, deoxypyridinoline, and N-terminal telopeptide levels (NTX) and ucOC:cOC or cOC:ucOC, and NTX:creatinine ratios were examined. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin K2 supplementation combined with vitamin D and calcium was found to be advantageous. However, vitamin K2 supplementation cannot replace the existing treatment options. In addition, vitamin K2 should be used with caution, considering its interactions with food and other drugs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two tocolytic drugs-atosiban and nifedipine-are currently used for first-line treatment of preterm labor (PTL). OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of atosiban with nifedipine for PTL treatment. SEARCH STRATEGY: In May 2017, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials with search terms including "nifedipine", "atosiban", and "preterm labor". SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of women with PTL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted for study design, patient characteristics, risk of bias domains, and study outcomes. A random-effects model was used to generate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We included seven studies that enrolled 992 patients. There was no significant difference between atosiban and nifedipine for pregnancy prolongation of 48 hours or more regarding efficacy (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92-1.22; P=0.440) or effectiveness (0.93, 0.84-1.03; P=0.177). Pregnancy prolongation for 7 days or more also did not differ between groups for efficacy (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.21; P=0.656) or effectiveness (0.91, 0.79-1.05; P=0.177). Atosiban-however-was associated with fewer maternal side-effects than nifedipine. CONCLUSION: Atosiban resulted in fewer maternal side-effects than nifedipine, with no difference in pregnancy prolongation. PROSPERO registration: CRD42018090223.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women. There are a limited number of targeted therapies available for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Among checkpoint inhibitors, atezolizumab is the only drug approved for PD-L1+ TNBC patients. We performed a systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in triple-negative breast cancer. We included 15 clinical trials in this review. Pembrolizumab was well tolerated by all patients with triple-negative breast cancer. Pembrolizumab was more effective in the treatment of early-stage TNBC patients as compared to placebo, regardless of PD-L1 status. In advanced-stage breast cancer, pembrolizumab was as effective as single-agent chemotherapy with a better safety profile. Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy showed significantly better median progression free survival as compared to chemotherapy in advanced TNBC.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) are associated with breast cancer. CoQ10 as an adjuvant treatment with conventional anti-cancer chemotherapy has been demonstrated to help in the inflammatory process and OS. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the efficacy of CoQ10 supplementation on levels of inflammatory markers, OS parameters, and matrix metalloproteinases/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (MMPs/TIMPs) in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out using electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Embase, up to December 2020 to identify eligible RCTs evaluating the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on OS biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, and MMPs/TIMPs. From 827 potential reports, 5 eligible studies consisting of 9 trials were finally included in the current meta-analysis. Quality assessment and heterogeneity tests of the selected trials were performed using the PRISMA checklist protocol and the I<sup>2</sup> statistic, respectively. Fixed and random-effects models were assessed based on the heterogeneity tests, and pooled data were determined as the standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Our meta-analysis of the pooled findings for inflammatory biomarkers of OS and MMPs showed that CoQ10 supplementation (100 mg/day for 45-90 days) significantly decreased the levels of VEGF [SMD: - 1.88, 95% CI: (- 2. 62 to - 1.13); I<sup>2</sup> = 93.1%, p < 0.001], IL-8 [SMD: - 2.24, 95% CI: (- 2.68 to - 1.8); I<sup>2</sup> = 79.6%, p = 0.001], MMP-2 [SMD: - 1.49, 95% CI: (- 1.85 to - 1.14); I<sup>2</sup> = 76.3%, p = 0.005] and MMP-9 [SMD: - 1.58, 95% CI: (- 1.97 to - 1.19); I<sup>2</sup> = 79.6%, p = 0.002], but no significant difference was observed between CoQ10 supplementation and control group on TNF-alpha [SMD: - 2.30, 95% CI: (- 2.50 to - 2.11); I<sup>2</sup> = 21.8%, p = 0.280], IL-6 [SMD: - 1.56, 95% CI: (- 1.73 to - 1.39); I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, p = 0.683], IL-1beta [SMD: - 3.34, 95% CI: (- 3.58 to - 3.11); I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, p = 0.561], catalase (CAT) [SMD: 1.40, 95% CI: (1.15 to 1.65); I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, p = 0.598], superoxide dismutase (SOD) [SMD: 2.42, 95% CI: (2.12 to 2.71); I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, p = 0.986], glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [SMD: 2.80, 95% CI: (2.49 to 3.11); I<sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, p = 0.543]], glutathione (GSH) [SMD: 4.71, 95% CI: (4.26 to 5.16); I<sup>2</sup> = 6.1%, p = 0.302] and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) [SMD: - 3.20, 95% CI: (- 3.53 to - 2.86); I<sup>2</sup> = 29.7%, p = 0.233]. CONCLUSION: Overall, the findings showed that CoQ10 supplementation reduced some of the important markers of inflammation and MMPs in patients with breast cancer. However, further studies with controlled trials for other types of cancer are needed to better understand and confirm the effect of CoQ10 on tumor therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common psychological traumas after earthquake. Social support is suggested as a protective factor, but the impact of social support on the prevention and reduction of PTSD among earthquake survivors is still unknown. This systematic review aims to explore the effectiveness of social support in prevention and reduction of PTSD in earthquake survivors. An electronic search was conducted in Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, including systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case control studies, cross-sectional surveys, and case studies. The initial search identified 1,202 articles, 748 were duplicates, 454 were excluded by abstract evaluation and 37 excluded based on full text appraisal, and 14 articles were finally included. The results of the included studies indicated an overall possible positive effect for social support for prevention of PTSD. However, the relationship is not a direct effect, and many confounding factors seems to play a role in this complex situation, such as gender, previous history of violent trauma, and self-efficacy. Future studies have to identify people who are prone to PTSD and can benefit from receiving social support, and they have to also make it clear what can constitute an effective social support.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the incidence and clinical impact of device related thrombus (DRT) following precautions left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO). BACKGROUND: Device-related thrombus is a known complication of LAAO. However, data on the incidence of DRT and its impact on outcomes are limited. METHODS: The authors performed a meta-analysis of randomized and observational studies to calculate the pooled incidence of DRT and the pooled odds ratio (OR) of ischemic events in patients with DRT and those without DRT. RESULTS: In the 66 included studies; the incidence of DRT was 351/10, 153 (3.8%, range 0% to 17%, I2 = 56.8). The diagnosis was made in <90, 90 to 365, and >365 days in 42%, 57%, and 1% of patients, respectively. There was no difference in DRT rates between the AMPLATZER (AMPLATZER, AGA Medical Corporation, Golden Valley, Minnesota) and WATCHMAN (WATCHMAN, Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, Massachusetts) devices (3.6% vs. 3.1%, p = 0.24). In a meta-regression, age, gender, heart failure, diabetes, CHA2DS2-VASc score, previous stroke, and post-LAAO antithrombotic regimen did not explain the heterogeneity in the incidence of DRT. The pooled incidence of ischemic events in studies that compared outcomes of patients with and without DRT (32 studies; n = 7,689) was 13.2% (37 of 280) in patients with DRT and 3.8% (285 of 7,399) in those without DRT (OR: 5.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.66 to 7.59; p < 0.001, I2 = 0). In a sensitivity analysis including randomized trials and prospective multicenter registries, the incidence of DRT was 3.7%, and DRT remained associated with higher rates of ischemic events (13.5% vs. 4.4%, OR: 4.15, 95% CI: 2.77 to 6.22; p < 0.001, I2 = 0). CONCLUSIONS: DRT after LAAO is uncommon (3.8%) but is associated with a 4- to 5-fold increase in ischemic events. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and the optimal surveillance and management of DRT.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common complication of pregnancy and can lead to significant perinatal mortalities as well as long term risk of comorbidities for both mother and her offspring. This systematic review aimed to explore whether combined diet and exercise interventions are associated with improved glycemic control and/or improved maternal and newborn outcomes in women with GDM when compared to dietary interventions. A search on combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy in women with GDM was performed in 3 electronic databases: PubMed (NCBI), ScienceDierct, and the Cochrane Library. Evaluated outcomes were fasting blood glucose levels, postprandial blood glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin percentages, total weight gain during pregnancy, proportion of caesarean delivery, proportion of patients needing insulin, neonatal birth weight, proportion of macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and preterm birth. This systematic review identified eight randomized, controlled trials involving 592 pregnant women and 350 infants. The risk of bias of the included trials ranged from high to low. The combined diet and exercise interventions reduced fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels when compared to dietary interventions. No significant differences were reported in the selected trials regarding total weight gain during pregnancy, cesarean section, neonatal birth weight, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and preterm birth between diet plus exercise and diet groups. The combination of diet and exercise interventions help to control postprandial blood glucose concentration in women diagnosed with GDM, but did not change either maternal or newborn outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Registry data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) show an increase of 40% in IUI and 377% in IVF cases using donor sperm between 2006 and 2016. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The objective of this study was to establish whether pregnancies conceived using donor sperm are at higher risk of obstetric and perinatal complications than those conceived with partner sperm. As more treatments are being carried out using donor sperm, attention is being given to obstetric and perinatal outcomes, as events in utero and at delivery have implications for long-term health. There is a need to know if there is any difference in the outcomes of pregnancies between those conceived using donor versus partner sperm in order to adequately inform and counsel couples. SEARCH METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcomes of pregnancies conceived using donor sperm compared with partner sperm. Searches were performed in the OVID MEDLINE, OVID Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL databases, including all studies published before 11 February 2019. The search strategy involved search terms for pregnancy, infant, donor sperm, heterologous artificial insemination, donor gametes, pregnancy outcomes and perinatal outcomes. Studies were included if they assessed pregnancies conceived by any method using, or infants born from, donor sperm compared with partner sperm and described early pregnancy, obstetric or perinatal outcomes. The Downs and Black tool was used for quality and bias assessment of studies. OUTCOMES: Of 3391 studies identified from the search, 37 studies were included in the review and 36 were included in the meta-analysis. For pregnancies conceived with donor sperm, versus partner sperm, there was an increase in the relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of combined hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: 1.44 (1.17-1.78), pre-eclampsia: 1.49 (1.05-2.09) and small for gestational age (SGA): 1.42 (1.17-1.79) but a reduced risk of ectopic pregnancy: 0.69 (0.48-0.98). There was no difference in the overall RR (95% CI) of miscarriage: 0.94 (0.80-1.11), gestational diabetes: 1.49 (0.62-3.59), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH): 1.24 (0.87-1.76), placental abruption: 0.65 (0.04-10.37), placenta praevia: 1.19 (0.64-2.21), preterm birth: 0.98 (0.88-1.08), low birth weight: 0.97 (0.82-1.15), high birthweight: 1.28 (0.94-1.73): large for gestational age (LGA): 1.01 (0.84-1.22), stillbirth: 1.23 (0.97-1.57), neonatal death: 0.79 (0.36-1.73) and congenital anomaly: 1.15 (0.86-1.53). WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The majority of our findings are reassuring, except for the mild increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and SGA in pregnancies resulting from donor sperm. However, the evidence for this is limited and should be interpreted with caution because the evidence was based on observational studies which varied in their quality and risk of bias. Further high-quality population-based studies reporting obstetric outcomes in detail are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder affecting about 10% of women in reproductive age and associated with a variety of hormonal abnormalities, including hyperandrogenemia and infertility, all of which could lead to PCOS. Statins were previously introduced as a therapeutic option for reducing testosterone levels in women with PCOS, either alone or in combination. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different statins alone or in combination with metformin in reducing testosterone levels in women with PCOS. METHODS: Medline, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies that investigated the efficacy of statins, metformin, spironolactone, or combined oral contraceptives (COCs), individually or in combination, in reducing the testosterone level in patients with PCOS. The search was limited to randomized clinical trials and conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses - extension statement for network meta-analyses (PRISMA-NMA). The quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias (RoB) assessment tool. A frequentist network meta-analysis using random-effects models was used to assess the efficacy in reducing testosterone level and were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% credible interval (95%Crl). All statistical analyses were performed using netmeta Version 1.0 on R statistical package. RESULT: Nine RCTs involving 613 patients were included. Atorvastatin showed greater reduction in testosterone level compared to COC (MD -2.78, 95%CrI -3.60, -1.97), spironolactone plus metformin (MD -2.83, 95%CrI -3.80, -1.87), simvastatin (MD -2.88, 95%CrI -3.85, -1.92), spironolactone (MD -2.90, 95%CI -3.77, -2.02), simvastatin plus metformin (MD -2.93, 95%CrI -3.79, -2.06), metformin (MD -2.97, 95%CrI -3.69, -2.25), lifestyle modification (MD -3.02, 95%CrI -3.87, -2.18), and placebo (MD -3.04, 95%CrI -3.56, -2.53). CONCLUSION: Atorvastatin was found to be more effective than the other management strategies in reducing the total testosterone level for patients with PCOS. Future studies should focus on the optimal dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analyses was to assess the risk of preeclampsia among women who conceived with assisted reproductive technology (ART). METHODS: We searched the ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline/PubMed, Scopus, and Embase (from inception to May 2017) for English language articles using a list of key words. In addition, reference lists from identified studies and relevant review articles were also searched. Data extraction was performed by two authors, and the study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random-effects model meta-analysis was applied to pool the relative risks (RR) across studies. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies (5 case-control studies and 43 cohort studies) were included in this meta-analysis. The Cochran Q test and I<sup>2</sup> statistics revealed substantial heterogeneity (Q = 26,313.92, d.f. = 47, p < 0.001 and I<sup>2</sup> = 99.8%). Meta-analysis showed a significant increase in preeclampsia in women who conceived by ART compared with those who conceived spontaneously (RR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.11-2.62, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this systematic review indicate that the use of ART treatment is associated with a 1.71-fold increase in preeclampsia.

AB  - PURPOSE: Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the evidence of intra-arterial therapies in liver metastatic breast cancer (LMBC) patients. METHODS: A systemic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS for studies regarding intra-arterial therapies in LMBC patients. Full text studies of LMBC patients (n >= 10) published between January 2010 and December 2020 were included when at least one outcome among response rate, adverse events or survival was available. Response rates were pooled using generalized linear mixed models. A weighted estimate of the population median overall survival (OS) was obtained under the assumption of exponentially distributed survival times. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies (1266 patients) were included. Eleven articles reported on transarterial radioembolization (TARE), ten on transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and four on chemo-infusion. One retrospective study compared TARE and TACE. Pooled response rates were 49% for TARE (95%CI 32-67%), 34% for TACE (95%CI 22-50%) and 19% for chemo-infusion (95%CI 14-25%). Pooled median survival was 9.2 months (range 6.1-35.4 months) for TARE, 17.8 months (range 4.6-47.0) for TACE and 7.9 months (range 7.0-14.2) for chemo-infusion. No comparison for OS was possible due to missing survival rates at specific time points (1 and 2 year OS) and the large heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Although results have to be interpreted with caution due to the large heterogeneity, the superior response rate of TARE and TACE compared to chemo-infusion suggests first choice of TARE or TACE in chemorefractory LMBC patients. Chemo-infusion could be considered in LMBC patients not suitable for TARE or TACE. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3a.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of screening can be highly sensitive to the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) effects of screen tests and subsequent treatment. Accordingly, accurate assessment of HRQoL is essential. We reviewed the literature regarding HRQoL in cervical prevention and management in order to appraise the current evidence regarding this important input to CEA. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, Scopus and EconLit databases for studies that estimated HRQoL in cervical cancer prevention and management published January 1995-December 2015. The primary inclusion criterion was for studies that assess HRQoL using the EQ-5D. Data were abstracted from eligible studies on setting, elicitation group, sample size, elicitation instruments, health state valuations, study design and follow-up. We assessed the quality and comparability of the studies with a particular focus on the HRQoL reported across states and groups. RESULTS: Fifteen papers met the inclusion criteria. Most used patient elicitation groups (n = 11), 2 used the general public and 2 used a mix of both. Eight studies were cross-sectional and seven were longitudinal. Six studies used both the EQ-5D-3L and the EQ-VAS together with other measures of overall HRQoL or condition-specific instruments. Extensive heterogeneity was observed across study characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal the challenges of sourcing reliable estimates of HRQoL for use in CEAs of cervical cancer prevention and treatment. The EQ-5D appears insufficiently sensitive for some health states. A more general problem is the paucity of HRQoL estimates for many health states and their change over time.

AB  - Purpose/Hypothesis: Cardiovascular disease is a common health problem resulting from many factors including dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia, which includes abnormal levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), is estimated to affect 41 to 98 million men and women in the United States. A decreased level of HDL-C has been shown to be a strong predictor of CVD, even when LDL-C levels are within normal limits. Some evidence suggests that tai chi interventions may be associated with improved cardiovascular health. However, there is conflicting data as to whether tai chi improves lipid profiles. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate existing randomized clinical trials (RCT) to investigate the effect of Tai Chi interventions on lipid profiles, and specifically on HDL-C levels. Number of Subjects: N/A. Materials/METHODS: Medline and CINAHL searches were performed using combinations of the terms tai chi and lipids or lipoprotein. We included RCTs published in English that used tai chi as the primary intervention and included HDL-C as a primary outcome, and LDL-C or total cholesterol (TC) as secondary outcomes. Two reviewers independently evaluated the included studies, assessing for risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and for levels of evidence using modified Sacket criteria. RESULTS: We identified 37 potentially eligible studies. Of these, 7 RCTs were eligible for our qualitative review, and 6 were eligible for meta-analysis. The included studies generally demonstrated low risk of bias as determined by the Cochrane tool. Specifically, 4 studies were assessed as being at low risk for biasing factors, and 3 studies as being at high risk. All studies failed to blind participants to group assignment, and were unclear about whether data was selectively reported. Further, 4 studies were unclear regarding their strategy for missing data. In terms of tai chi's effectiveness, a fixed effect model demonstrated a small positive effect on HDL-C (Cohen d = 0.11; Standard Error [SE] = 0.069; P = .056), while a random effects model demonstrated a medium effect for LDL-C (Cohen d = 0.67; SE = 0.371; P < .05) and a small effect for TC (Cohen d = 0.35; SE = 0.251; P = .082). CONCLUSIONS: Tai chi may beneficial affect lipid profiles across different age groups and populations including middle aged inactive adults, healthy older adults, and people with insomnia, hypertension, or kidney diseases. Although there was variation regarding the overall effectiveness of tai chi on lipid profiles in our meta-analysis, the majority of studies showed at least a small positive effect, indicating that tai chi is potentially beneficial for HDL-C, LDL-C and TC. Clinical Relevance: Tai chi is an easy to perform and enjoyable form of exercise that may positively influence lipid profiles. Our analysis suggests that physical therapists should consider using tai chi as a component of interventional approaches designed to reduce CVD risk.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous meta-analyses have shown a moderate negative impact of maltreatment on the neuropsychological functioning of people with or without psychiatric disorders compared to healthy groups. The objectives of the present meta-analysis were to (1) investigate the impact of maltreatment on neuropsychological functioning of people with psychiatric disorders and to (2) evaluate the moderating effect of age, at the time of the cognitive assessment, on neuropsychological functioning. METHODS: Seventeen studies published between 1970 and July 2017 were included. RESULTS: The results showed a negative impact of maltreatment with a small effect size (g = -0.25) on the neuropsychological performances in the group with psychiatric disorders with a history of exposure to childhood maltreatment compared to the group with psychiatric disorders without a history of exposure to childhood maltreatment. Cognitive domains that are significantly affected by maltreatment are: working memory (g = -0.56), verbal episodic memory (g = -0.39), intelligence (g = -0.27) and processing speed (g = -0.21). The impact of childhood maltreatment on the cognitive profile is greater in adults than young people. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider these common cognitive deficits using a transdiagnostic approach in cognitive interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Infertility is defined as the inability of heterosexual couples to achieve a successful clinically recognizable pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse. Infertility estimations are very important to inform the healthcare policymakers and governments to implement appropriate social and economic policies. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of infertility (primary and secondary) and its etiologic factors in Sudan. METHODS: This study included all published and unpublished studies written in Arabic or English. Electronic sources (namely, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov) and nonelectronic sources (direct Google search, Google Scholar, OpenGrey, OATD, WorldCat log, and university websites) were used from their inception to May 16, 2021. A total of 1955 studies were reviewed, of which only 20 studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. Studies were eligible if they provided the prevalence of infertility in Sudan. The Joanna Briggs Institute Quality Assessment Tool was used to evaluate each study. Data synthesis and statistical analysis were conducted using Jeffrey's Amazing Statistics Program version 0.14.1.0. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of overall infertility, primary infertility, and secondary infertility in Sudan were 13% (I<sup>2</sup> = 96.45, p < 0.001), 65% (I<sup>2</sup> = 98.5, p < 0.001), and 35% (I<sup>2</sup> = 98.5, p < 0.001), respectively, and the prevalence of infertility factors were 41%, 27%, 16%, and 17% for female, male, combined factors, and unexplained factors, respectively. Women with infertility were mainly present because of ovulatory disorders (ovulatory factors, 36%; polycystic ovary syndrome, 38%). By contrast, spermatic disorders such as azoospermia (37%), oligozoospermia (30%), and asthenozoospermia (30%) were the main causes of male infertility. CONCLUSION: In Sudan, the prevalence of primary infertility is higher than that of secondary infertility. Female factors were the most common causes of infertility in Sudan, and this study found a high prevalence of unexplained factors. Polycystic ovary syndrome and azoospermia were the most common causes of female and male infertility in Sudan, respectively. The interpretation of these findings should take into consideration the presence of substantial heterogeneity between the included studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) occurs in the elderly and the early stage of aging, with early clinical manifestations of memory impairment, cognitive impairment, behavioral change and decline in language function, etc., and eventually loss of the ability to live independently, requiring 24-hour care, and a variety of complications. However, these complications are the direct cause of death in AD patients. With the acceleration of the aging process of society, the incidence of AD is increasing year by year, seriously threatening the physical health and quality of life of the elderly. There are many ways to treat AD, however, moxibustion is especially popular in China. Therefore, our systematic review aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxibustion in the treatment of ADand to provide reliable evidence for clinical decision-makers. METHODS: We will search electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database (WF), and China Scientific Journals Database (VIP) from inception to January 2021. Two authors will independently screen the studies, extract data information, and assess methodological quality through the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool. The RevmanV.5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The results of this study will evaluate the current status of moxibustion therapy for AD, aiming to prove the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion therapy, and will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: This systematic review will provide a credible evidence-based for moxibustion in the treatment of AD. Inplasy registration number: Inplasy202110021.

AB  - Objectives:Taking a small amount of tissue from the lining of the womb (endometrium) can sometimes improve the chance of achieving a pregnancy in women who have previously had several unsuccessful attempts at In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF). This procedure has been named endometrial scratch (ES). It is not known exactly why performing an Endometrial Scratch may be beneficial, but it is thought that the process of scratching the lining of the womb may release certain chemicals that are important in helping the fertilised egg (embryo) stick to the lining of the womb (implantation). The use of Endometrial Scratch has not yet been fully tried in women who are about to have IVF for the first time. If found to be beneficial then it could be used to improve the chance of achieving a pregnancy for a large group of women without the need for repeated IVF attempts. Our study aims to explore the use of performing an Endoemtrial Scratch in younger women (37yrs of age or younger) about to start their first IVF treatment cycle. The study will involve 1044 participants over the course of two &amp; half years. Women taking part in the study will be selected to have either the scratch or not in a random way (like a tossing a coin) so each woman would have a 50/50 chance of having the scratch procedure. Those having the scratch would be known as the study group and those who do not the control group . Both groups would then have their IVF treatment in the usual way and would be followed up to see whether or not they get pregnant and have a healthy baby. Except for one extra visit when the scratch is performed, the study does not involve any other visits or treatments above normal routine care. Participation in this study will be entirely voluntary and the choice not to participate would not have any impact on the woman s care. Performing the emdometrial scratch is a very simple routine outpatient procedure that does not require any anaesthetic. Women are advised to take some simple painkillers beforehand (such as paracetamol) as these should lessen the chance of any discomfort as the procedure can sometimes cause period like cramps. The procedure involves placing a small tube (about the size of a small drinking straw) through the neck of the womb and then the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is gently scratched . There will be a small sub-study performed in only in Sheffield where consent will be sought to remove a small amount of tissue from the lining of the womb. This tissue will be stored and later examined in the laboratory which could provide helpful information to tell us why some women may respond better than others to the scratch procedure. Performing the Endometrial Scratch has no clear risks although, in theory, inserting any instrument into the womb could carry a risk of infection. However all women having IVF are routinely screened for important vaginal infections before starting their IVF treatment. The Endometrial Scratch procedure is performed about a week before starting IVF treatment. The study will involve collaboration with 10 units across the UK. Each Unit will have a designated person responsible for the safe running of the study(Principle Investigator) but the overall conduct of the study will lie with the Chief Investigator at the lead site. By the end of the study we hope to be able to tell whether or not endometrial scratch should be offered routinely to women having their first IVF treatment cycle.

AB  - Objectives:Gallstones are common, especially in women, but in many people they do not cause any symptoms. About one in three people with gallstones develop symptoms. Symptoms usually include a severe pain in the upper right-hand side of the abdomen (known as biliary colic ), and sometimes nausea and vomiting. At times the pain is accompanied by inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis).Once gallstones start giving symptoms, painkillers, anti-inflammatory medicines and antibiotics are usually prescribed initially and surgery is advised to medically fit patients. Surgery to remove the gallbladder, known as cholecystectomy, is the most common way to treat biliary pain or cholecystitis due to gallstones. Approximately 70,000 cholecystectomies are performed every year in the UK, with significant costs for the NHS. In the UK, surgery is commonly offered to people who present at secondary care with pain or cholecystitis due to gallstones. However, it is known that some patients do not have any more symptoms after the initial episode of pain and that surgery may not be necessary. A policy of conservative management (painkillers/antibiotics and lifestyle advice) could, therefore, be appropriate in this group of people. A review of current evidence suggested that conservative management may provide a more efficient use of NHS resources. There were, however, great uncertainties in the data, with only two small studies run in Norway. There is a need for a definitive clinical trial to address these uncertainties. The study proposed here will identify patients for the trial at hospital settings for people referred by general practitioners with symptomatic gallstone disease. Patients will be recruited following informed consent to participate using processes approved by an NHS Research Ethics Committee. Once consented, the patient will be allocated randomly to either receive a surgical procedure to remove the gallbladder or to receive conservative management. Apart from treatment allocation and measurement of study outcomes, participants will have standard NHS follow up. Based on statistical calculations, we aim to recruit 430 participants over one and half years who will be followed up for at least 18 months across 20 UK hospitals. The main outcome of the study will be the difference between the two policies in the patients quality of life across an 18 month period from enrolment. We will assess this using a specifically designed questionnaire. To assess any longer term benefits of either policy we will use a mathematical model to give a prediction of quality of life over each participant s lifetime. We will use the measurements we collect and the model to work out whether gall bladder removal is worthwhile to the NHS in terms of balancing any benefit to people s health against the added costs (cost-effectiveness). The results of this study will enable patients, clinicians and policy-makers to decide the worth of conservative management as part of treatment of uncomplicated gallstone disease. We have assembled a national team of experts with experience in carrying out clinical trials of surgical procedures, including surgeons, trial methodologists, statisticians, economists and trial managers. The team also benefits from the valuable insight of a knowledgeable patient user group that will continue to be closely involved as the trial progresses. The funding will support essential staff and research resources necessary for this trial.

AB  - Objectives:The REACT project evaluates the usefulness and value for money of an intervention to promote physical activity in retired people aged 65 and over who have low levels of physical activity and who are already showing some signs of limited mobility. We propose to adapt the successful LIFE intervention programme from the USA, which has been shown to be effective in improving mobility and physical functioning. Our previous development work, which involved extensive consultation with a network of service users and service providers as well as charities, researchers and experts in physical activity promotion, selected the LIFE programme as the best bet for use in the UK to promote physical activity with a wide range of older people living in different areas and with different cultural backgrounds. We will adapt the LIFE intervention for use in leisure and community centres in three locations during low cost daytime hours. The programme takes full account of the needs of UK older adults, particularly those in more deprived/less well-off communities. REACT is a 12-month activity programme for inactive people aged 65 and over designed to help them get started with activity, become fitter, and improve their health and well-being. As well as improving heart fitness, strength and balance, it emphasises enjoyment of activities, provides opportunities for rewarding social contact, and helps people develop skills for long term changes in their lifestyle. A novel element is the "ambassadors" programme that provides the opportunity for people who have taken part to get involved as programme recruiters, supporters, or in helping other participants to get involved in activities in the local community. We will conduct a pilot study to confirm that the programme can be delivered as planned and that the trial procedures work well. If we have problems with recruitment, obtaining follow-up measurements, or delivering the intervention we will stop the trial. Otherwise the study will carry on to become a full-scale evaluation study. In total this will involve 768 people. We will ask them to sign up to either join our REACT intervention programme or to receive a less intensive intervention (including information, vouchers for taster sessions at local centres and attendance at two sessions with a healthy living education group). All participants will complete tests at the start of the study and then again at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. This will include a set of three tests of physical functioning (a balance test, a sit-to-stand test and a walking speed test), wearing a small device that assesses their physical activity for a week, and some questionnaires to measure health status and mental health. Participants will be invited to contribute to discussion groups, where we will get feedback about whether the proposed intervention and evaluation methods were acceptable and how they might be improved. The work will be conducted by a team of researchers and practitioners who are experienced in promoting physical activity in older people and in conducting this type of research. The proposed research is important because physical fitness makes a huge difference to older people s mobility and quality of life. We currently do not have any interventions targeting functional ability in older people that have been shown to be effective and to provide good value for money

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The incidence of metabolic syndrome varies greatly in developed and developing countries. In the last 10 to 15 years, important studies have been performed examining the incidence of metabolic syndrome in Turkey. This article is a meta-analysis of the studies that investigated the incidence of metabolic syndrome this country. METHODS: Epidemiological studies from the last 15 years that provided information about the incidence of metabolic syndrome in Turkey were screened in the Ovid Medline, the Web of Science Core Collection, and the Turkish Academic Network and Information Center (ULAKBIM) databases. In addition, web pages of the Ministry of Health, the Turkish Statistical Institute, and the associations of the related medical discipilnes were screened for appropriate studies. A bias tool that is developed by our team was used to categorize the included studies as having low- or high risk of bias. A random effects model was used in the meta-analysis. Linear and nonlinear meta-regression analyses were performed to evaluate heterogeneity and temporal variations in prevalence rates. RESULTS: Four studies (n=34893) were identified that provided information about the status of metabolic syndrome in Turkey using the Adult Treatment Panel III definition. There was excellent interobserver agreement regarding the selection of studies and the scoring of the selected research with respect to bias. The metaanalysis revealed a prevalence of 32.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30.2-35) overall, 38.3% (95% CI: 35.8-40.8) in women, and 26.8% (95% CI: 23.4-30.3) in men. Two studies (n=8568) provided data according to the International Diabetes Federation definition of metabolic syndrome. The random effects model used in the metaanalysis of these studies demonstrated a prevalence of metabolic syndrome of 43.3% (95% CI: 41.9-44.7) overall, 50.4% (95% CI: 49.0-51.9) in women, and 35.4% (95% CI: 32.5-38.5) in men. CONCLUSION: In Turkey, the incidence of metabolic syndrome is 1 in every 4 men, and 1 in every 3 women. The rate is particularly high among women. Studies designed to prevent the development of metabolic syndrome are needed.

AB  - This meta-analytic review examines the association between childhood sexual abuse and risky sexual behaviours with sub-group analyses by gender. Systematic searches of electronic databases including MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO were performed using key terms. We used a priori criteria to include high quality studies and control for heterogeneities across eligible studies. The review was registered with PROSPERO and used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The final meta-analysis applied fixed-effects model to generate pooled odds ratio (OR). Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential methodological moderators. The meta-analysis included 8 eligible studies (N=38,989, females=53.1%). The overall syndemic of risky sexual behaviors at adulthood was 1.59 times more common in childhood sexual abuse victims. There was a similar association between childhood sexual abuse in general and subsequent risky sexual behaviors in both females and males. However, in cases of substantiated childhood sexual abuse, there was a greater odds of risky sexual behaviors in females (OR=2.72) than males (OR=1.69). The magnitude of association of childhood sexual abuse and risky sexual behaviors was similar for males and females regardless of study time, study quality score and method of childhood sexual abuse measurement. There were nonsignificant overall and subgroup differences between males and females. Childhood sexual abuse is a significant risk factor for a syndemic of risky sexual behaviors and the magnitude is similar both in females and males. More research is needed to explore possible mechanisms of association.

AB  - PURPOSE: There is no published dose-response meta-analysis on the association between height and colorectal cancer risk (CRC) by sex and anatomical sub-site. We conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies on the association between height and CRC risk with subgroup analysis and updated evidence on the association between body fatness and CRC risk. METHODS: PubMed and several other databases were searched up to November 2016. A random effects model was used to calculate dose-response summary relative risks (RR's). RESULTS: 47 studies were included in the meta-analyses including 50,936 cases among 7,393,510 participants. The findings support the existing evidence regarding a positive association of height, general and abdominal body fatness and CRC risk. The summary RR were 1.04 [95% (CI)1.02-1.05, I² = 91%] per 5 cm increase in height, 1.02 [95% (CI)1.01-1.02, I² = 0%] per 5 kg increase in weight, 1.06 [95% (CI)1.04-1.07, I² = 83%] per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI, 1.02 [95% (CI)1.02-1.03, I² = 4%] per 10 cm increase in waist circumference, 1.03 [95% (CI)1.01-1.05, I² = 16%] per 0.1 unit increase in waist to hip ratio. The significant association for height and CRC risk was similar in men and women. The significant association for BMI and CRC risk was stronger in men than in women. CONCLUSION: The positive association between height and risk of CRC suggests that life factors during childhood and early adulthood might play a role in CRC aetiology. Higher general and abdominal body fatness during adulthood are risk factors of CRC and these associations are stronger in men than in women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccination, screening, and linkage to care can reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, recommendations vary among organizations, and their implementation has been suboptimal. The American College of Physicians' High Value Care Task Force and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed this article to present best practice statements for hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care. METHODS: A narrative literature review of clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized trials, and intervention studies on hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care published between January 2005 and June 2017 was conducted. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Clinicians should vaccinate against hepatitis B virus (HBV) in all unvaccinated adults (including pregnant women) at risk for infection due to sexual, percutaneous, or mucosal exposure; health care and public safety workers at risk for blood exposure; adults with chronic liver disease, end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis patients), or HIV infection; travelers to HBV-endemic regions; and adults seeking protection from HBV infection. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Clinicians should screen (hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) for HBV in high-risk persons, including persons born in countries with 2% or higher HBV prevalence, men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, HIV-positive persons, household and sexual contacts of HBV-infected persons, persons requiring immunosuppressive therapy, persons with end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis patients), blood and tissue donors, persons infected with hepatitis C virus, persons with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (≥19 IU/L for women and ≥30 IU/L for men), incarcerated persons, pregnant women, and infants born to HBV-infected mothers. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Clinicians should provide or refer all patients identified with HBV (HBsAg-positive) for posttest counseling and hepatitis B-directed care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of individuals. Understanding the experiences of people living with PAD will be useful in developing comprehensive patient-centred secondary prevention therapies for this population. AIM: The aim of this study is to identify first-hand accounts of patients' experiences of living with PAD. METHODS: Six databases (CINALH, PsyclNFO, MEDLINE, AMED, EMBASE, Social citation index/Science citation index via Web of Science (WOS)) and reference lists of identified studies were searched until September 2017 (updated February 2018). Qualitative studies reporting patients' account of living with PAD were eligible for inclusion. A framework thematic synthesis was implemented. RESULTS: Fourteen studies with 360 participants were included. Pain and walking limitation were recurrent among the varied symptom descriptions. Patients' ignorance and trivialisation of symptoms contributed to delays in diagnosis. Inadequate engagement in disease understanding and treatment decisions meant patients had poor attitudes towards walking treatments and unrealistic expectations about surgery. Depending on symptom progression, patients battle with walking impairment, powerlessness, and loss of independence which were a source of burden to them. Lack of disease understanding is central through patients' journey with PAD and, although they subsequently began adaptation to long term living with PAD, many worried about their future. CONCLUSIONS: Disease understanding is vital across the illness trajectory in patients with PAD. Although certain experiences are common throughout patient journey, some might be unique to a particular stage (e.g. unrealistic expectation about surgery, or rationale of walking in spite of pain in a supervised exercise program). Given that PAD is an overarching construct ranging from the mildest form of intermittent claudication to severe critical limb ischemia with ulceration and gangrene, consideration of important patient constructs specific to each stage of the disease may enhance treatment success.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at increased risk of pregnancy complications and need information on safe, effective contraceptive methods to avoid unintended pregnancy. This systematic review examines evidence regarding safety of contraceptive use among women with CHD. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched for any peer-reviewed articles published through April 2018 that included safety outcomes associated with reversible contraceptive methods among women with CHD. RESULTS: Five articles met inclusion criteria: three studies comparing contraceptive users to nonusers and two noncomparative studies. Sample sizes ranged from 65 to 505 women with CHD. Two studies found a higher percent of thromboembolic complications among women with Fontan palliation or transposition of the great arteries using oral contraceptives. One study, among women with Fontan palliation, found no increased risk of thromboembolic complications between contraceptive users (not separated by type) and nonusers. Two studies found no endocarditis among intrauterine device users. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of contraceptive methods among women with CHD. Limited evidence suggests an increased incidence of thromboembolic complications with use of oral contraceptives. Further studies are needed to evaluate contraceptive safety and quantify risk in this growing population. There is also limited data regarding the safety of contraceptive methods among women with CHD. Further information is needed to assist practitioners counseling women with CHD on safety of contraceptive methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the sex difference in the prevalence of COVID-19 confirmed cases. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for related information. The authors developed a data extraction form on an Excel sheet and the following data from eligible studies were extracted: author, country, sample size, number of female patients and number of male patients. Using STATA V.14 for analysis, the authors pooled the overall prevalence of men and/or women using a random-effect meta-analysis model. The authors examined the heterogeneity in effect size using Q statistics and I2 statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was also checked. PARTICIPANTS: Studies on COVID-19 confirmed cases were included. INTERVENTION: Sex (male/female) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was considered. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 among men and women. RESULTS: A total of 57 studies with 221 195 participants were used in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among men was found to be 55.00 (51.43-56.58, I2=99.5%, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed the findings were not dependent on a single study. Moreover, a funnel plot showed symmetrical distribution. Egger's regression test p value was not significant, which indicates absence of publication bias in both outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 was found to be higher in men than in women. The high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption contributed to the high prevalence of COVID-19 among men. Additional studies on the discrepancies in severity and mortality rate due to COVID-19 among men and women and the associated factors are recommended.

AB  - Coagulation abnormalities, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction have been described in COVID-19 patients. Spontaneous muscle hematoma (SMH) is a rare complication in COVID-19. The aims of this study are to: (1) perform a systematic review of the literature to better define the clinical SMH characteristics, (2) describe the prevalence and the clinical characteristics of SMH in COVID-19 patients referring to a Department of Internal Medicine (IM) (Federico II University of Naples), a Department of Sub-Intensive Care Medicine (SIM) (Ospedale Del Mare), and a Department of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (Federico II University). The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA criteria. The local prevalence of SMH in COVID-19 was evaluated retrospectively. The medical records of all COVID-19 patients referring to IM and ICU from March 11th, 2020, to February 28th, 2021 were examined for SMH occurrence. In our retrospective analysis, we describe 10 cases of COVID-19 patients with SMH not previously reported in literature, with a prevalence of 2.1%. The literature review, inclusive of our case series, describes a total of 50 SMHs in COVID-19 patients (57.4% males; mean age 68.8 +/- 10.0 years). The SMH sites were ileo-psoas, vastus intermedius, gluteus, sternocleidomastoid, and pectoralis major muscles. Males developed SMH earlier than females (9.5 +/- 7.8 vs. 17.1 +/- 9.7 days). Ileo-psoas hematoma was more frequent in males (69.2 vs. 30.8%), while pectoralis major hematoma occurred only in females. The in-hospital mortality rate of SMH in COVID-19 patients was 32.4%. SMH is a rare but severe complication in COVID-19 hospitalized patients, associated with high mortality. A gender difference seems to be present in the clinical presentation of the disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is inevitable in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to its effect on the gastrointestinal system, immune system, and high metabolic activity. However, the prevalence of malnutrition and its outcomes is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and outcome of malnutrition among patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from December 29, 2019 to September, 2020 without language restriction. All observational studies reporting the prevalence of malnutrition were included while case reports and reviews were excluded. The data were extracted with two independent authors with a customized format and the disagreements were resolved by the other authors. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using a standardized critical appraisal tool. RESULTS: A total of 511 articles were identified from different databases and 27 articles were selected for evaluation after the successive screening. Fourteen articles with 4187 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of malnutrition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 49.11% (95% CI: 31.67 to 66.54). The odd of mortality among patients COVID-19 with malnutrition was 10 times more likely as compared to those who were well-nourished. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition and mortality associated with malnutrition among COVID-19 hospitalized patients was very high which entails a mitigating strategy by different stakeholders to prevent and manage malnutrition and its outcomes. REGISTRATION: This systematic review was registered in Prospero's international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020215396).

AB  - Peak stimulated growth hormone (GH) levels are known to decrease with increasing body mass index (BMI), possibly leading to overdiagnosis of GH deficiency (GHD) in children with overweight and obesity. However, current guidelines do not guide how to interpret the peak GH values of these children. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to study the effect of the BMI standard deviation score (SDS) on stimulated peak GH values in children, to identify potential moderators of this association, and to quantify the extent to which peak GH values in children with obesity are decreased. This systematic review was performed by the PRISMA guidelines. Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched for studies reporting the impact of weight status on peak GH in children. Where possible, individual participant data was extracted and/or obtained from authors. Quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) checklists. The primary outcome was the association between peak GH values and BMI SDS. The pooled correlation coefficient r, 95% confidence interval (CI), and heterogeneity statistic I2 were calculated under a multilevel, random-effects model. In addition, exploratory moderator analyses and meta-regressions were performed to investigate the effects of sex, pubertal status, presence of syndromic obesity, mean age and mean BMI SDS on the study level. For the individual participant dataset, linear mixed-models regression analysis was performed with BMI SDS as the predictor and ln(peak GH) as the outcome, accounting for the different studies and GH stimulation agents used. In total, 58 studies were included, providing data on n = 5135 children (576 with individual participant data). Thirty-six (62%) studies had high, 19 (33%) medium, and 3 (5%) low risks of bias. Across all studies, a pooled r of -0.32 (95% CI -0.41 to -0.23, n = 2434 patients from k = 29 subcohorts, I2 = 75.2%) was found. In meta-regressions, larger proportions of males included were associated with weaker negative correlations (p = 0.04). Pubertal status, presence of syndromic obesity, mean age, and mean BMI SDS did not moderate the pooled r (all p > 0.05). Individual participant data analysis revealed a beta of -0.123 (95% CI -0.160 to -0.086, p < 0.0001), i.e. per one-point increase in BMI SDS, peak GH decreases by 11.6% (95% CI 8.3-14.8%). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the impact of BMI SDS on peak GH values in children. It showed a significant negative relationship. Importantly, this relationship was already present in the normal range of BMI SDS and could lead to overdiagnosis of GHD in children with overweight and obesity. With the ever-rising prevalence of pediatric obesity, there is a need for BMI (SDS)-specific cutoff values for GH stimulation tests in children. Based on the evidence from this meta-analysis, we suggest the following weight status-adjusted cutoffs for GH stimulation tests that have cutoffs for children with normal weight of 5, 7, 10, and 20 µg/L: for overweight children: 4.6, 6.5, 9.3, and 18.6 µg/L; and for children with obesity: 4.3, 6.0, 8.6, and 17.3 µg/L.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The variability of the urethral plate (UP) characteristics is one of the factors that influence technical choices for hypospadias correction. However, it is difficult to objectively evaluate the UP, leading to controversies in this subject, and vague terms utilized in the literature to describe its characteristics. OBJECTIVE: We aim to analyze the previously described methods used to characterize and evaluate UP quality, emphasizing the pros and cons of each system, and highlighting its possible influence on different postoperative outcomes. METHODS: We searched the databases PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library CENTRAL from January 1, 2000 to August 20, 2020. The following concepts were searched: urethra reconstruction/urethra replacement/urethroplasty AND hypospadias/hypospadias, AND children AND "plate" with the gray literature search. Subgroup analyses were also carried out. The quality of the involved studies was reviewed operating a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). RESULTS: 996 citations perceived as relevant to screening were retrieved. Thirteen studies were included comprising a total of 1552 cases. The number of patients in each study varied between 42 and 442, and the average post-surgical follow-up duration ranged between 6 months and twenty-six months. All studies used postoperative urethral stents of variable sizes and types. The impact of UP was most frequently assessed for cases treated with the tubularized incised plate (TIP) repair. CONCLUSION: The UP quality seems to play a role as an independent factor influencing postoperative outcomes of hypospadias repair. Currently used strategies for the appraisal of UP quality are highly subjective with a low index of generalizability. Various attempts to overcome these limitations exist but none was consistently accepted, leaving a wide space for creative investigation in order to obtain an objective, reproducible, precise, and well-validated tool.

AB  - Effective decision making in the healthcare setting is highly dependent on access to reliable and robust data and information. A minimum data set is a standard assessment instrument that is used during the data collection process to ensure that decision makers have access to a consistent set of information. The objective of the current study was to develop a minimum data set for infertility patients that can be employed as the basis for an infertility registry in Iran. A systematic review resulted in the identification of 2,501 articles and 17 patient forms from infertility centers that were relevant to the study objectives. Of these, 10 articles met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 232 data elements were subsequently extracted from these papers. The data elements were classified by three experts and validated via two rounds of a Delphi technique. The accessibility of the data elements was then evaluated during a focus group discussion. Finally, 146 data elements were selected as the minimum data set. The proposed minimum data set could provide the basis for standardization of infertility treatments. Synchronizing the various data sets that are currently in use will be necessary to allow sharing of data across infertility registries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Profound healthcare challenges confront societies with an increase in prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Due to several facility and patient related factors, ESRD is significantly associated with increased morbidity and mortality attributed to infections. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess systematically the characteristics of patients and risk factors associated with nosocomial infections among ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify eligible studies published during the period from inception to December 2018 pertaining to risk factors associated with nosocomial infections among hemodialysis patients. The relevant studies were generated through a computerized search on five databases (PubMed, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and Scopus) using the Mesh Words: nosocomial infections, hospital acquired infections, healthcare associated infections, end stage renal disease, end stage renal failure, hemodialysis, and risk factors. The complete protocol has been registered under PROSPERO (CRD42019124099). RESULTS: Initially, 1411 articles were retrieved. Out of these, 24 were duplicates and hence were removed. Out of 1387 remaining articles, 1337 were removed based on irrelevant titles and/or abstracts. Subsequently, the full texts of 50 articles were reviewed and 41 studies were excluded at this stage due to lack of relevant information. Finally, nine articles were selected for this review. Longer hospital stay, longer duration on hemodialysis, multiple catheter sites, longer catheterization, age group, lower white blood cell count, history of blood transfusion, and diabetes were identified as the major risk factors for nosocomial infections among hemodialysis patients. CONCLUSION: The results of this review indicate an information gap and potential benefits of additional preventive measures to further reduce the risk of infections in hemodialysis population. Moreover, several patient-related and facility-related risk factors were consistently observed in the studies included in this review, which require optimal control measures.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Occupational noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) due to industrial, military, and other job -related noise exposure can cause harmful health issues to occupied workers, but may also be potentially preventable. Vitamins/antioxidant have been studied as therapeutic strategies to prevent and/or delay the risks of human diseases as well as NIHL .So, this study was conducted to systematically review the protective effects of vitamins/antioxidants on occupational NIHL. METHODS: Online databases including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were systematically searched up to 12 January 2021. Based on 6336 potentially relevant records identified through the initial search in the databases, 12 full-text publications were retrieved, one of which can be viewed as two separate trials, because it has studied the effects of two different antioxidants (ginseng and NAC) on NIHL, separately. RESULTS: A review of the studies shows that vitamin B12, folic acid, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have a considerable protective effect on NIHL. However, these protective effects are not yet specified in different frequencies. The findings regarding the protective effects of other antioxidants are inconsistent in this field. CONCLUSION: Vitamin B12, folic acid, and NAC may have a protective effect as an antioxidant on reducing occupational hearing loss. For a conclusive evidence of vitamin/antioxidant protective therapies, future studies with precise criteria for noise exposure and similar outcome parameters are required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: First pass effect (FPE) in mechanical thrombectomy is thought to be associated with good clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine FPE rates as a function of thrombectomy technique and to compare clinical outcomes between patients with and without FPE. METHODS: In July 2020, a literature search on FPE (defined as modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2c-3 after a single pass) and modified FPE (mFPE, defined as TICI 2b-3 after a single pass) and mechanical thrombectomy for stroke was performed. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, we evaluated the following outcomes for both FPE and mFPE: overall rates, rates by thrombectomy technique, rates of good neurologic outcome (modified Rankin Scale score <=2 at day 90), mortality, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) rate. RESULTS: Sixty-seven studies comprising 16 870 patients were included. Overall rates of FPE and mFPE were 28% and 45%, respectively. Thrombectomy techniques shared similar FPE (p=0.17) and mFPE (p=0.20) rates. Higher odds of good neurologic outcome were found when we compared FPE with non-FPE (56% vs 41%, OR=1.78) and mFPE with non-mFPE (57% vs 44%, OR=1.73). FPE had a lower mortality rate (17% vs 25%, OR=0.62) than non-FPE. FPE and mFPE were not associated with lower sICH rate compared with non-FPE and non-mFPE (4% vs 18%, OR=0.41 for FPE; 5% vs 7%, OR=0.98 for mFPE). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that approximately one-third of patients achieve FPE and around half of patients achieve mFPE, with equivalent results throughout thrombectomy techniques. FPE and mFPE are associated with better clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Lifestyle factors heavily influence the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD); therefore, interventions delivering adequate lifestyle changes may improve the prognosis among patients at cardiovascular (CV) risk. Recently published research on the effectiveness of dietary and exercise intervention programmes, alone or combined, on reducing risk factors associated with CVD as well as preventing CV events have been now assessed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the Medline database via PubMed, we searched for prospective studies published between January 2000 and January 2020 assessing the efficacy of dietary interventions alone or in combination with exercise on reducing CV risk factors or events in human adults at risk. Study quality was assessed using the American Dietetic Association Quality Criteria Checklist. From 934 articles, 21 prospective experimental design studies (15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), one cluster RCT, and five quasi-experimental intervention studies with a control group) met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most interventions improved at least some markers of CV risk and the most improvement was time devoted to physical activity increased. A low-fat intervention diet seemed to be effective only when coupled with moderate intensity exercise and weight loss, while a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) intervention without physical activity, decreased both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, major CV events rate and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSION: The MedDiet appears to have the most beneficial effect on CV events and increased hours of physical training are strongly related to greater improvement of risk factors; nevertheless, adherence to intervention is fundamental as it directly relates to health outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol administration studies are crucial because causal questions about alcohol's role in human behavior can only be answered through experimental research that randomly assigns participants to drink conditions. The primary goal of this review is to catalogue the characteristics of experimental analogues used in alcohol administration research to assess men's sexual aggression proclivity and evaluate the extent to which they represent the scope of alcohol-involved sexual aggression. Although this review focuses on sexual aggression analogues, the identified methodological issues are relevant to a wide range of alcohol administration studies. METHODS: Online databases were searched for published studies that randomly assigned participants to drink conditions and assessed participants' sexual aggression proclivity with an experimental analogue. Characteristics of the analogues were coded by both authors. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified that used 12 unique experimental analogues. All of the analogues depicted a completed or potential sexual assault in an apartment between a male perpetrator and female victim who did not know each other well. This information was presented in written (n = 7), audio (n = 1), video (n = 3), or virtual simulation (n = 1) format. Sexual aggression proclivity was measured through participants' self-reports (n = 10) and behavioral responses (n = 2). Perpetrators primarily used physical force which the woman verbally and physically resisted. Only one analogue depicted behavioral signs of the woman's alcohol impairment; none included signs of the man's alcohol impairment. CONCLUSIONS: These analogues were designed to address important theoretical questions; however, they do not represent the full range of alcohol-involved sexual assaults. This hampers the development of evidence-based prevention and treatment programs because we do not know if these findings generalize to other types of sexual assaults (e.g., with incapacitated victims, within serious relationships, with sexual and other gender minorities). Funding agencies need to support more alcohol administration research in order to provide a strong foundation for the development of effective interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: While increasing attention is paid to the rising prevalence of chronic diseases in Africa, there is little focus on chronic kidney disease (CKD). This systematic review assesses CKD burden among the general population and high-risk groups on the entire African continent. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We searched Medline and PubMed databases for articles published between 1 January 1995 and 7 April 2017 by sensitive search strategies focusing on CKD surveys at the community level and high-risk groups. In total, 7918 references were evaluated, of which 7766 articles were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thus, 152 studies were included in the final analysis. OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The prevalence of CKD in each study group was expressed as a range and pooled prevalence rate of CKD was calculated as a point estimate and 95% CI. No meta-analysis was done. Data were presented for different populations. RESULTS: In the community-level studies, based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies, the prevalence of CKD ranged from 2% to 41% (pooled prevalence: 10.1%; 95% CI 9.8% to 10.5%). The prevalence of CKD in the high-risk groups ranged from 1% to 46% (pooled prevalence: 5.6%; 95% CI 5.4% to 5.8%) in patients with HIV (based on available medium-quality and high-quality studies), 11%-90% (pooled prevalence: 24.7%; 95% CI 23.6% to 25.7%) in patients with diabetes (based on all available studies which are of low quality except four of medium quality) and 13%-51% (pooled prevalence: 34.5%; 95 % CI 34.04% to 36%) in patients with hypertension (based on all available studies which are of low quality except two of medium quality). CONCLUSION: In Africa, CKD is a public health problem, mainly attributed to high-risk conditions as hypertension and diabetes. The poor data quality restricts the validity of the findings and draws the attention to the importance of designing future robust studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Over the past 20 years, there has been a growing interest in the psychosocial outcomes of children and adolescents born with a congenital heart defect (CHD). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to appraise and synthesize current literature on the psychosocial outcomes of children and adolescents with severe CHD. METHODS: A search of studies examining psychosocial outcomes in children and adolescents with severe CHD was performed. Meta-analyses were used to calculate the prevalence of psychosocial impairments and the standardized mean differences between cases and controls. Results that were not included in the meta-analysis were collated using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies were included in this review, and results were summarized according to three domains: behavior, social cognition, and self-esteem. Results from a meta-analysis identified that 25% of children and adolescents with CHD presented behavioral problems. Children and adolescents with CHD had more problematic behavior than healthy peers (standardized mean difference; g = 0.71). Young people with CHD had significantly more difficulties inferring on the mental states of others (standardized mean difference; g = 0.72). In contrast, identifying the emotions of others and self-esteem was not statistically different from healthy controls. CONCLUSION: This review and meta-analysis provides evidence to support the presence of psychosocial difficulties in children and adolescents born with a severe CHD giving grounds for the systematic assessment of behavior and social cognition during their clinical follow-up.

AB  - Homeobox transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), one of the well-known long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), plays an important role in initiation and development of various tumors. Elevated level of HOTAIR is associated with metastatic behavior of primary tumor and poor outcome in several cancers. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clearly measure the prognostic impact of HOTAIR in patients with digestive system carcinomas. Fourteen studies including 2,666 patients with five different type of digestive system cancers were selected to be entered in meta-analysis. Finding demonstrated that HOTAIR overexpression could predict unfavorable outcome in digestive system carcinomas (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0-2.9; p < 0.001; fixed-effect model). In stratified analysis, increased level of HOTAIR predicted poor overall survival in gastric cancer (HR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.9; p < 0.001), colorectal cancer (HR = 4.1, 95% CI: 1.6-10.2; p = 0.002), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.7-3.0; p < 0.001), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.9-6.1; p < 0.001). Our meta-analysis results clearly support the prognostic value of HOTAIR to predict unfavorable prognostic outcomes in diverse digestive system carcinomas.

AB  - AIMS: Metformin may have clinical benefits in dialysis patients; however, its safety in this population is unknown. This systematic review evaluated the safety of metformin in dialysis patients. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised controlled trials and observational studies evaluating metformin use in dialysis patients. Three authors reviewed the studies and extracted data. The primary outcomes were mortality, occurrence of lactic acidosis and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients taking metformin during dialysis treatment for >=12 months (long term). Risk of bias was assessed using Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-1). Overall quality of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: Fifteen observational studies were eligible; 7 were prospective observational studies and 8 were case reports/case series. No randomised controlled trials were identified. The 7 prospective observational studies (n = 194) reported on cautious metformin use in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. Only 3 provided long-term follow-up data. In 2 long-term studies of metformin therapy (<=1000 mg/d) in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), 1 reported 6 deaths (6/83; 7%) due to major cardiovascular events (3 MI) and the other reported no deaths (0/35). One long-term study of metformin therapy (250 mg to 500 mg thrice weekly) in patients undergoing haemodialysis reported 4 deaths (4/61; 7%) due to major cardiovascular events (2 MI). These findings provide very low-quality evidence as they come from small observational studies. CONCLUSION: The evidence regarding the safety of metformin in people undergoing dialysis is inconclusive. Appropriately designed randomised controlled trials are needed to resolve this uncertainty.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of delay in initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy on the outcomes of breast cancer patients referred for adjuvant treatment. METHODS: This is a pooled analysis of patient-level data of 3390 breast cancer patients referred for adjuvant chemotherapy in three clinical trials. Overall and relapse-free survivals were assessed according to "surgery to chemotherapy interval" through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Likewise, among patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy, relapse-free survival was assessed according to "surgery to radiotherapy interval" through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and Multivariate analysis of factors affecting overall and relapse-free survival was then conducted through Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival according to surgery to chemotherapy interval (<vs. > 6 weeks) was conducted. When stratified by the hormone receptor status, the longer interval was associated with worse overall survival in hormone receptor-negative patients (P=0.006); while it was not associated with overall survival difference in hormone receptor-positive patients (P=0.268). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the test of interaction between "surgery to chemotherapy interval" and hormone receptor status was significant (P=0.015). Moreover, when the multivariate analysis was restricted to hormone receptor-negative patients, longer surgery to chemotherapy interval was associated with worse overall survival among this subset of patients (P=0.004). On the other hand, in multivariate analysis of factors affecting relapse-free survival, surgery to radiotherapy interval did not impact relapse-free survival (P=0.439). CONCLUSION: Among hormone receptor-negative patients, delaying chemotherapy initiation beyond 6 weeks (after surgery) is associated with worse patient outcomes. Moreover, delaying radiotherapy initiation beyond surgery does not compromise outcomes in patients receiving long course adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to assess the impact of disease-free interval (DFI) following treatment of primary localized breast cancer on the outcomes of patients with subsequent metastatic breast cancer treated with first-line docetaxel chemotherapy. This study is a combined analysis of patient-level raw data of 604 metastatic breast cancer patients referred for docetaxel first-line chemotherapy in two clinical trials. Overall survival and time to progression were evaluated according to DFI through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting overall survival and time to progression was then conducted through Cox regression analysis. For the overall cohort, shorter DFI is associated with worse overall survival (P < 0.0001). When classified by the hormone receptor status, the shorter interval was associated with worse overall survival in both hormone receptor positive and negative patients (P = 0.009; P = 0.018; respectively). Likewise, shorter DFI is associated with shorter time to progression (P < 0.0001) in the overall cohort. When classified by the hormone receptor status, the shorter interval was associated with shorter time to progression for hormone receptor negative but not positive patients (P = 0.001; P = 0.070; respectively). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, the following factors were associated with worse overall survival: shorter DFI (P < 0.0001), poorer ECOG performance score (P = 0.008) and lower body mass index (P = 0.018). Likewise, in multivariate Cox regression analysis, the following factors were associated with shorter time to progression: shorter DFI (P < 0.0001) and hormone receptor negative status (P = 0.025). Shorter DFI was associated with worse overall survival and shorter time to progression among patients receiving first-line docetaxel chemotherapy.

AB  - Breast cancer remains the most common cancer among women worldwide. Many patients, especially in our region, are affected while young and during their child-bearing years. Chemotherapy, more commonly used in this age group, may result in premature ovarian failure and thus negatively impact their fertility. Several fertility-preservation methods are currently in use in this age group. Unfertilized ova cryopreservation and in vitro fertilization plus embryo cryopreservation are widely used in clinical practice. More recently, ovarian tissue cryopreservation is gaining in popularity. Several clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that premenopausal women who received ovarian function suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists while on chemotherapy were less likely to experience ovarian failure and had higher rates of menses resumption compared to those who did not. Some studies have also shown higher rates of successful pregnancies among treated patients. Given the conflicting results of the reported clinical trials and even the many published meta-analyses, this approach continues to be controversial and should only be used when other established fertility preservation methods cannot be utilized. The current review seeks to provide an updated summary on this controversial topic by reviewing all recently published clinical trials and meta-analyses.

AB  - Objective The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the risk of developing elevated antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies and related thromboembolic and/or pregnancy events following a viral infection. Method We searched Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed ePubs, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through June 2016. Independent observational studies of elevated aPL antibodies in patients with a viral infection compared with controls or patients with lupus were included. Results We analyzed 73 publications for 60 studies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were most commonly reported. Compared with healthy controls, patients with HIV were more likely to develop elevated anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies (risk ratio (RR) 10.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6-19.4), as were those with HCV (RR 6.3, 95% CI 3.9-10.1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (RR 4.2, 95% CI 1.8-9.5), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (RR 10.9 95% CI 5.4-22.2). The only statistically significant increased risk for anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta2-GPI) antibodies was observed in patients with HCV (RR 4.8 95% CI 1.0-22.3). Compared with patients with lupus, patients with HIV were more likely to develop elevated aCL antibodies (RR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.6), and those with EBV, elevated anti-beta2-GPI antibodies (RR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3-3.9). Thromboembolic events were most prevalent in patients with elevated aPL antibodies who had HCV (9.1%, 95% CI 3.0-18.1), and HBV (5.9%, 95% CI 2.0-11.9) infections, and pregnancy events were most prevalent in those with parvovirus B19 (16.3%, 95% CI 0.78-45.7). However, compared to virus-infected patients with negative aPL antibodies, the only statistically significant increased risk was observed in those with HCV and positive aPL. Conclusions Viral infection can increase the risk of developing elevated aPL antibodies and associated thromboembolic events. Results are contingent on the reported information.

AB  - - Background Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common liver neoplasm, the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and the third most common cause of cancer mortality. Moreover, its incidence has increased dramatically in the past decade. While surgical resection and liver transplantation are the main curative treatments, only around 20% of people with early hepatocellular carcinoma may benefit from these therapies. Current treatment options for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma include various ablative and transarterial therapies in addition to the drug sorafenib. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of external beam radiotherapy in the management of localised unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), Science Citation Index Expanded (Web of Science), and clinicaltrials.gov registry. We also checked reference lists of primary original studies and review articles manually for further related articles (cross‐references) up to October 6, 2016. Selection criteria Eligible studies included all randomised clinical trials comparing external beam radiotherapy either as a monotherapy or in combination with other systemic or locoregional therapies versus placebo, no treatment, or other systemic or locoregional therapies for people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used a random‐effects model as well as a fixed‐effect model meta‐analysis but in case of discrepancy between the two models (e.g. one giving a significant intervention effect, the other no significant intervention effect), we reported both results; otherwise, we reported only the results from the fixed‐effect model meta‐analysis. We assessed risk of bias of the included trials using predefined risk of bias domains; assessed risks of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis; and presented the review results incorporating the methodological quality of the trials using GRADE. Main results Nine randomised clinical trials with 879 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low quality. All of the included trials compared combined external beam radiotherapy plus chemoembolisation versus chemoembolisation alone in people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma; moreover, three of the trials compared external beam radiotherapy alone versus chemoembolisation alone. All trials were conducted in China. The median age in most of the included trials was around 52 years, and most trial participants were male. The median follow‐up duration ranged from one to three years. None of the trials reported data on cancer‐related mortality, quality of life, serious adverse events, or time to progression of the tumour. For the comparison of radiotherapy plus chemoembolisation versus chemoembolisation alone, the risk ratio for one‐year all‐cause mortality was 0.51 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.62; P < 0.001; 9 trials; low‐quality evidence); for complete response rate was 2.14 (95% CI 1.47 to 3.13; P < 0.001; 7 trials; low‐quality evidence); and for overall response rate defined as complete response plus partial response was 1.58 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.78; P < 0.001; 7 trials; low‐quality evidence), all in favour of combined treatment with external beam radiotherapy plus transarterial chemoembolisation and seemingly supported by our Trial Sequential Analysis. Additionally, the combined treatment was associated with a higher risk of elevated total bilirubin and elevated alanine aminotransferase. The risk ratio for the risk of elevated alanine aminotransferase was 1.41 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.84; P = 0.01; very low‐quality evidence), while for elevated total bilirubin it was 2.69 (95% CI 1.34 to 5.40; P = 0.005; very low‐quality evidence). For the comp rison of radiotherapy versus chemoembolisation, the risk ratio for one‐year all‐cause mortality was 1.21 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.50; 3 trials; I 2 = 0%; very low‐quality evidence) which was not supported by our Trial Sequential Analysis. In addition, we found seven ongoing randomised clinical trials evaluating different external beam radiotherapy techniques for people with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Authors' conclusions We found very low‐ and low‐quality evidence suggesting that combined external beam radiotherapy and chemoembolisation may be associated with lower mortality and increased complete and overall response rates, despite an increased toxicity as expressed by a higher rise of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase. A high risk of systematic errors (bias) as well as imprecision and inconsistency suggest that these findings should be considered cautiously and that high‐quality trials are needed to assess further the role of external beam radiotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Plain language summary Radiotherapy administered externally for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) Review question What are the benefits and harms of radiotherapy administered externally in people with advanced liver cancer compared with other available therapies or no therapy? Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer) is the most common cancerous tumour of the liver and the sixth most common cancerous tumour worldwide. In the majority of people with hepatocellular carcinoma, the disease is diagnosed at the advanced stage. Treatment options for these people include ablation (which destroys the tumour), embolisation (the use of substances to block or decrease the flow of blood through the hepatic artery to the tumour), radiotherapy, or sorafenib, which is a targeted drug therapy (a treatment that uses a substance to identify and attack cancer cells while avoiding normal cells). Study characteristics We searched the medical literature for randomised clinical trials (where people are allocated at random to one of two or more treatment groups) in order to perform an analysis of the role of radiotherapy administered externally for advanced liver cancer. We found nine randomised clinical trials including a total of 879 people with advanced liver cancer. All of the included trials were conducted in China. The average age in most of the included studies was around 52 years, and most trial participants were male. The average follow‐up duration ranged from one to three years. All trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as low to very low quality. Most of the included trials compared combined radiotherapy and chemoembolisation versus chemoembolisation alone. We also identified seven ongoing randomised clinical trials. The evidence is current to October 2016. Key results When compared with chemoembolisation alone, combined radiotherapy plus chemoembolisation may be associated with fewer deaths and more tumour size reduction, despite being associated with an increased risk for non‐life‐threatening adverse effects such as a higher rise of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase. Quality of the evidence and conclusions Combined radiotherapy and chemoembolisation may be associated with fewer deaths and increased overall response, but also an increased risk of adverse effects, when compared with chemoembolisation alone. The low quality of evidence suggests that these results should be considered cautiously and that high‐quality randomised trials should be performed to assess further the role of external beam radiotherapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancers are a group of rare heterogeneous malignant tumours. They include intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, gallbladder carcinomas, and ampullary carcinomas. Surgery remains the optimal modality of therapy leading to long-term survival for people diagnosed with resectable biliary tract carcinomas. Unfortunately, most people with biliary tract carcinomas are diagnosed with either unresectable locally-advanced or metastatic disease, and they are only suitable for palliative chemotherapy or supportive care. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of intravenous administration of gemcitabine monotherapy or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy versus placebo, or no intervention, or other treatments (excluding gemcitabine) in adults with advanced biliary tract carcinomas. SEARCH METHODS: We performed electronic searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index – Science up to June 2017. We also checked reference lists of primary original studies and review articles manually, for further related articles (cross-references). SELECTION CRITERIA: Eligible studies include randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language or publication status, comparing intravenous administration of gemcitabine monotherapy or gemcitabine-based combination to placebo, to no intervention, or to treatments other than gemcitabine. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We assessed risks of bias of the included trials using definitions of predefined bias risk domains, and presented the review results incorporating the methodological quality of the trials using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included seven published randomised clinical trials with 600 participants. All included trials were at high risk of bias, and we rated the evidence as very low quality. Cointerventions were equally applied in three trials (gemcitabine plus S-1 (a combination of tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil) versus S-1 monotherapy; gemcitabine plus S-1 versus gemcitabine monotherapy versus S-1 monotherapy; and gemcitabine plus vandetanib versus gemcitabine plus placebo versus vandetanib monotherapy), while four trials compared gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin; gemcitabine plus mitomycin C versus capecitabine plus mitomycin C; gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin versus chemoradiotherapy; and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin versus 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid versus best supportive care. The seven trials were conducted in India, Japan, France, China, Austria, South Korea, and Italy. The median age of the participants in the seven trials was between 50 and 60 years, and the male/female ratios were comparable in most of the trials. Based on these seven trials, we established eight comparisons. We could not perform all planned analyses in all comparisons because of insufficient data.Gemcitabine versus vandetanib One three-arm trial compared gemcitabine versus vandetanib versus both drugs in combination. It reported no data for mortality, health-related quality of life, or tumour progression outcomes. We rated the increased risk of serious adverse events, anaemia, and overall response rate as very low-certainty evidence.Gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin From one trial of 96 participants, we found very low-certainty evidence that gemcitabine can lower the risk of mortality at one year when used with cisplatin versus S-1 plus cisplatin (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.98; P = 0.04; participants = 96). The trial did not report data for serious adverse events, quality of life, or tumour response outcomes. There is very low-certainty evidence that gemcitabine plus cisplatin combination leads to a higher risk of high-grade thrombocytopenia compared with S-1 plus cisplatin combination (RR 5.28, 95% CI 1.23 to 22.55; P = 0.02; participants = 96).Gemcitabine plus S-1 versus S-1 From two trials enrolling 51 participants, we found no difference between the two groups in terms of risk of mortality at one year or risk of serious adverse events. Gemcitabine plus S-1 combination was associated with a higher overall response rate compared with S-1 alone (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.75; P = 0.007; participants = 140; trials = 2; I2 = 0%; very low certainty of evidence). Neither of the trials reported data for health-related quality of life or time to progression of the tumour.Gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin versus 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid versus best supportive care One three-arm trial compared gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin versus 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid versus best supportive care. It reported no data for serious adverse events, health-related quality of life, or tumour progression. We rated the evidence for mortality and for overall response rate as of very low certainty.Gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin versus 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin plus radiotherapy One trial of 34 participants compared gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin versus 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin plus radiotherapy. It reported no data for quality of life, overall response rate, or tumour progression outcomes. We rated the evidence for mortality and serious adverse events as of very low certainty.Gemcitabine plus mitomycin C versus capecitabine plus mitomycin C One trial of 51 participants compared gemcitabine plus mitomycin C versus capecitabine plus mitomycin C. It reported no data for serious adverse events, quality of life, or tumour progression. We rated the evidence for mortality, overall response rate and thrombocytopenia as of very low certainty.We also identified three ongoing trials evaluating outcomes of interest for our review, which we can incorporate in future updates.For-profit bias: there was a high risk of for-profit bias in two trials (because of industry sponsorship) while there was a low risk of for-profit bias in another three trials, and unclear risk in two trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In adults with advanced biliary tract carcinomas, the effects of gemcitabine or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy are uncertain on mortality and overall response compared with a range of inactive or active controls. The very low certainty of evidence is due to risk of bias, lack of information in the analyses and hence large imprecision, and possible publication bias. The confidence intervals do not rule out meaningful benefits or lack of effect of gemcitabine in all comparisons but one on mortality where gemcitabine plus cisplatin is compared with S-1 plus cisplatin. Gemcitabine-based regimens showed an increase in non-serious adverse events (particularly haematological toxicities). Further randomised clinical trials are mandatory, to further explore the best therapeutic options for adults with advanced biliary tract carcinomas.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine long-term clinical outcomes with transcatheter patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure versus medical therapy alone in patients with cryptogenic stroke. BACKGROUND: A long-standing debate regarding the optimal approach for the management of patients with PFO after a cryptogenic stroke exists. METHODS: An electronic search was performed for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) reporting clinical outcomes with PFO closure vs. medical therapy alone after stroke. Random effects DerSimonian-Laird risk ratios (RR) were calculated. The main outcome was recurrence of stroke. Other outcomes included transient ischemic attack (TIA), new-onset atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL), major bleeding, serious adverse events, and device-related complications. All-cause mortality was also examined. RESULTS: Five RCTs with a total of 3,440 patients were included. At a mean follow-up of 4.02 +/- 1.57 years, PFO closure was associated with less recurrence of stroke (RR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.19-0.91; P = .027) compared with medical therapy alone. No difference was observed between both strategies for TIA (P = .21), major bleeding (P = .69), serious adverse events (P = .35), and all-cause death (P = .48). However, PFO closure, was associated with increased new-onset AF/AFL (P < .001), risk of pulmonary embolism (P = .04), and device-related complications (P < .001). On a subgroup analysis, stroke recurrence rate remained lower in PFO closure arm regardless of the type of closure device used (P<sub>interaction</sub> = .50), or the presence of substantial shunt in the majority of study population (P<sub>interaction</sub> = .13). CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter PFO closure reduces the recurrence of stroke compared with medical therapy alone, with no significant safety concerns. Close follow-up of patients after PFO closure is recommended to detect new-onset atrial arrhythmias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients may develop post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP-4) inhibitors are evolving agents in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors in the management of post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the electronic databases using keys words and Mesh terms. Data were extracted and reviewed using structured proforma. A comprehensive review of the eligible studies was performed independently by each of two reviewers; conflicts were resolved by the third reviewer. The primary efficacy endpoint was the difference in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) comparing any of the DPP-4 inhibitors to either placebo or other hypoglycaemic agent. The primary safety endpoints were the worsening of graft functions and change in Tacrolimus trough level. We performed the Random effect model using standardised mean difference. RESULTS: We identified seven studies that were eligible for the systematic review; only one study compared Sitagliptin to insulin Glargine. One study involved head to head comparison of three DPP-4 inhibitors. The other five studies were pooled in the meta-analysis. DPP-4 inhibitors had a favourable glycemic effect as measured by HbA1c when compared to either placebo or oral anti-hyperglycemic medications (standardised mean difference in HbA1c = -0.993, 95% CI= -1.303 to -0.683, P=0.001). DPP-4 inhibitors use did not result in significant change in eGFR ((standardised mean difference = 0.147, 95% CI= -0.139 - 0.433, p=0.312). ) nor Tacrolimus level (standardised Mean Difference= 0.152, 95% CI= -0.172 to 0.477, P=0.354). CONCLUSION: Current evidence supports the short term efficacy and safety of DDP-4 inhibitor agents in the management of post transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) in kidney transplant recipients. However, more RCTs are required to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of these agents in kidney transplant recipients.

AB  - - Background Evidence on the health effects of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is equivocal. Fish oils are rich in omega‐3 PUFA and plant oils in omega‐6 PUFA. Evidence suggests that increasing PUFA‐rich foods, supplements or supplemented foods can reduce serum cholesterol, but may increase body weight, so overall cardiovascular effects are unclear. Objectives To assess effects of increasing total PUFA intake on cardiovascular disease and all‐cause mortality, lipids and adiposity in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower PUFA intakes in adults with or without cardiovascular disease that assessed effects over 12 months or longer. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished data. Outcomes were all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate effects of PUFA intake from other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We wrote to authors of included trials for further data. Meta‐analyses used random‐effects analysis, sensitivity analyses included fixed‐effects and limiting to low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence. Main results We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA. Increasing PUFA intake probably has little or no effect on all‐cause mortality (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and cardiovascular disease events from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate‐quality evidence. Increasing PUFA may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease death (6.6% to 6.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 9 trials, 8810 participants) and stroke (1.2% to 1.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44, 11 trials, 14,742 participants, though confidence intervals include important harms), but has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26, 16 trials, 15,107 participants) all low‐quality evidence. Effects of increasing PUFA on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and atrial fibrillation are unclear as evidence is of very low quality. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly decreases triglycerides (by 15%, MD ‐0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.20 to ‐0.04, 20 trials, 3905 participants), but has little or no effect on total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) ‐0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.23 to ‐0.02, 26 trials, 8072 participants), high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD ‐0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.02 to 0.01, 18 trials, 4674 participants) or low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD ‐0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI ‐0.09 to 0.06, 15 trials, 3362 participants). Increasing PUFA probably has little or no effect on adiposity (body weight MD 0.76 kg, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.19, 12 trials, 7100 participants). Effects of increasing PUFA on serio s adverse events such as pulmonary embolism and bleeding are unclear as the evidence is of very low quality. Authors' conclusions This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all‐cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via TG reduction. Plain language summary Polyunsaturated fatty acids for prevention and treatment of diseases of the heart and circulation Review question We reviewed randomised trials (participants have an equal chance to be assigned to either treatment) examining effects of increasing intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on deaths and diseases of the heart and circulation (cardiovascular diseases), including heart attacks and stroke. Background We eat PUFA in our usual food, but quantities of PUFA eaten vary. There is some evidence that increasing the amount of PUFA we eat can reduce our blood cholesterol and make us less likely to develop cardiovascular disease, particularly if PUFAs are eaten instead of saturated fats (fats from animal sources such as meat and cheese). But eating more PUFA may increase our body weight, and omega‐6 fats (one component of PUFA) may worsen cardiovascular risk by increasing inflammation. Evidence on the benefits or harms of increasing PUFA intake on diseases of the heart and circulation, or on other health outcomes, is inconclusive. Trial characteristics Evidence in this Cochrane Review is current to 27 April 2017. We included 49 trials randomising 24,272 participants, for one to eight years. These trials assessed effects of eating more, compared to less PUFA, on diseases of the heart and circulation, and deaths. Twelve trials were very trustworthy (had low risk of bias overall). Participants were men and women, some with existing illnesses and some not. Trials took place in North America, Asia, Europe and Australia, and sixteen were funded only by national or charitable agencies. Key results Increasing PUFA probably makes little or no difference (neither benefit nor harm) to our risk of death (moderate‐quality evidence), and may make little or no difference to our risk of dying from cardiovascular disease (low‐quality evidence). However, increasing PUFA probably slightly reduces our risk of heart disease events and of combined heart and stroke events (moderate‐quality evidence). Fifty three people would need to eat more PUFA to prevent one person experiencing a heart disease event, and 63 people to prevent one person experiencing a heart or stroke event. Increasing PUFA may very slightly reduce risk of death due to heart disease, as well as stroke, but harm is possible (low‐quality evidence). PUFA probably slightly reduces fats circulating in the blood (triglycerides, moderate‐quality evidence but without effects on other lipids or adiposity). The evidence mainly comes from dietary‐advice trials of men living in high‐income countries.

AB  - AIM: We aimed to summarize the pooled effect of early discharge compared with ordinary discharge after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the composite endpoint of re-infarction, revascularization, stroke, death, and incidence of rehospitalization. We also aimed to compare costs for the two strategies. METHODS: The study was a systematic review and a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials including 2962 patients, followed by trial sequential analysis. An estimation of cost was considered. Follow-up time was 30 days. RESULTS: For early discharge, pooled effect for the composite endpoint was relative risk of efficacy (RRe)=0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.52-0.81). Rehospitalization had a pooled effect of RRe=1.10, 95% CI (0.88-1.38). Early discharge had an increasing risk of rehospitalization with increasing frequency of hypertension for all populations, except those with stable angina, where a decreasing risk was noted. Advancing age gave increased risk of revascularization. Early discharge had a cost reduction of 655 Euros per patient compared with ordinary discharge. CONCLUSION: The pooled effect supports the safe use of early discharge after PCI in the treatment of a heterogeneous population of patients with coronary artery disease. There was an increased risk of rehospitalization for all subpopulations, except patients with stable angina. Clinical trials with homogeneous populations of acute coronary syndrome are needed to be conclusive on this issue.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to summarize the evidence from observational studies examining the risk factors of the incidence of mediastinitis in open heart surgery. Design: The study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts and case-control studies. Material and Methods: We searched the literature and 74 studies with at least one risk factor were identified. Both fixed and random effects models were used. Heterogeneity between studies was examined by subgroup and meta-regression analysis. Publication bias or small study effects were evaluated and corrected by limit meta-analysis. Results: When correcting for small study effect, presence of obesity as estimated from 43 studies had Odds Ratio OR =2.26. (95% CI: 2.17-2.36). This risk was increasing with decreasing latitude of study place. Presence of diabetes mellitus from 63 studies carried an OR =1.90 (95% CI: 1.59-2.27). Presence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) from 30 studies had an OR =2.59 (95% CI: 2.22-2.85). Presence of bilateral intramammary graft (BIMA) from 23 studies carried an OR =2.54 (95% CI: 2.07-3.13). This risk was increasing with increasing frequency of female patients in the study population. Conclusion: Evidence from this study showed the robustness of the risk factors in the pathogenesis of mediastinitis. Preventive measures can be implemented for reducing obesity, especially in lower latitude countries. Furthermore, it is mandatory to monitor perioperative hyperglycemias with continuous insulin infusion. Use of skeletonized BIMA carries higher risk of mediastinitis especially in female patients without evidence of beneficial effect on survival for the time being.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the diabetes mellitus complications, which develops in approximately one-third of diabetic patients. Probiotics are microorganisms such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium which have some benefits with gastrointestinal disorders and diabetic patients. AIM: We aim to assess the efficacy of probiotic supplementation in patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane on 20 august 2019 and updated the search on 26 April 2020 using relevant keywords. Studies were screened for eligibility. We extracted the data from the relevant articles and then these data were pooled as mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI), using Review Manager software (ver. 3.5). RESULTS: Pooled data from four trials compared probiotics with a placebo showed a significant reduction in insulin (MD = -1.99, 95% CI [-3.99, 0.01]) and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (MD = -3.87, 95% CI [-7.51, -0.22]), High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (MD = -1.55, 95% CI [-2.19, -0.92]), malondialdehyde (MD = -0.77, 95% CI [-0.96, -0.58]), sodium (MD = -0.93, 95% CI [-1.87, -0.01]), but the total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased (MD = 62.29, 95% CI [18.34, 106.24]), while no significant effect on other lipid profiles, oxidative stress biomarkers or kidney function parameters like creatinine and glomerular filtration rate. Two trials showed that probiotic soy is better than conventional soy in terms of kidney function and lipid profiles. CONCLUSION: Probiotics supplementation decreases serum insulin and insulin resistance, but it has no beneficial effect regarding kidney function, body-weight, and lipid profiles, with a moderate positive effect regarding some oxidative stress biomarkers. Also, probiotic soy protein may improve kidney function and lipid profiles. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to assess the long-term effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic Anti-Reflux Surgery (LARS) is an established alternative treatment to pharmacological therapy for patients with Gastro Osophageal Reflux Disease (GORD), yet its safety and efficacy in obese patients is controversial. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to compare LARS related to obesity. METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (January 1970 to July 2017) were searched for studies reporting clinical outcomes of LARS in patient cohorts stratified by Body Mass Index (BMI). Data was grouped according to BMI, <30kg/m<sup>2</sup> (non-obese) and >=30kg/m<sup>2</sup> (obese). Primary outcome measures were reflux recurrence, operative morbidity, re-intervention (redo surgery and endoscopic dilatation), conversion to open surgery, and early return to theatre. Results were pooled in meta-analyses as Odds Ratios (OR). RESULTS: Thirteen eligible observational studies comparing LARS in non-obese (n=6246) and obese (n=1753) patients were identified. Recurrence of reflux was significantly lower in the non-obese cohort (OR 0.28, 95% C.I. 0.13 to 0.61, p=0.001), however no significant differences were observed in rates of operative morbidity (OR 0.82, 0.54 to 1.23, p=0.33), redo surgery (OR 0.94, 0.51 to 1.72, p=0.84), endoscopic dilatation (OR 0.98, 0.45 to 2.17, p=0.97), conversion to open surgery (OR 0.96, 0.50 to 1.85, P=0.90), or early return to theatre (OR 0.77, 0.43 to 1.38, p=0.39). CONCLUSIONS: LARS can be performed safely in obese patients, but risks higher GORD recurrence. Clinicians and patients should be aware that obesity may adversely affect LARS outcome and careful consideration be given in the consent process inherent within the optimal management of GORD.

AB  - Due to its minimal systematic adverse effects, transdermal estrogen is widely used for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. The present meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effects of transdermal estrogen on bone mineral density (BMD) of postmenopausal women. Studies were identified by searching electronic databases including Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase , and CINAHL databases, and also the Sciences Citation Index. Systematic review of articles was published between January 1989 to February 2016.Reference lists of the included articles were also evaluated and consultations were made with relevant experts. While 132 studies included the desired keywords, only nine clinical trials met the inclusion criteria and were finally reviewed. The pooled percent change in BMD was statistically significant in favor of transdermal estrogen. According to resulting pooled estimate, lumbar spine BMD one and two years after transdermal estrogen therapy was respectively 3.4% (95% CI: 1.7-5.1) and 3.7% (95% CI: 1.7-5.7) higher than the baseline values. The test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant based on the I(2) heterogeneity index. One-two years of transdermal estrogen delivery can effectively increase BMD and protect the bone structure in postmenopausal women.

AB  - Context: Hypertension (HTN) is a well-known modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease and mortality. Positive effects of blood pressure (BP) lowering for prevention of CVD and death have been documented in several meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. Evidence Acquisition: This review focuses on the key findings derived from the Tehran lipid and glucose study (TLGS) papers on different aspects of BP and HTN. Results: A prevalence of 23% for HTN has been reported in the TLGS population, aged >= 20 years. Over a decade long follow-up, the crude incidence rate (95% CI) of new-onset HTN defined as systolic BP (SBP) >= 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) >= 90 mmHg, and not using antihypertensive medication was 33.63 (32.0 - 35.3) per 1000 person-years. Age, baseline SBP and body mass index were significant risk factors for development of isolated systolic HTN; regarding isolated diastolic HTN, baseline DBP and waist circumference were recognized as important risk factors whereas age, female gender and marriage were shown to be protective factors. SBP decreased significantly in both diabetic and non-diabetic participants; DBP showed a non-significant decrease in diabetic men and a statistically significant decrease in non-diabetic men. Among women, both those with and without diabetes (DM) generally experienced statistically significant decreases in DBP. Cox proportional hazard models showed that neither SBP nor DBP were associated with incident DM in the total population and in either gender, separately. All BP components were associated with CVD and all-cause mortality in the middle-aged population. Contribution of HTN to cerebrovascular events was also documented in the TLGS participants, aged >= 50 years. Conclusions: Several important findings regarding BP/HTN have been derived from the TLGS. According to data regarding the prevalence and incidence of preHTN and HTN and their contribution to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the TLGS population as a representative sample of Tehranian population, it is recommended that interventions be prioritized for lifestyle modifications for the prevention and appropriate management of preHTN/HTN.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: With the rise of urbanization globally, the problem of living in slums has become a problem for the civil society. As a vulnerable segment, women make up half of the population in these regions; therefore, women's mental health has always been a concern. The purpose of this study was to review the social determinants of mental health in women living in slum areas. METHODS: We systematically reviewed articles published between 2009 and 2019 on the social determinants of women's mental health in SID, Magiran, Google scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and PsychARTICLES databases using MeSH keywords according to PRISMA guidelines. The quality of the studies was assessed depending on the type of study using Ottawa Newcastle" scale and Joanna Briggs Institute quality assessment tools. Finally, 23 studies were analyzed. RESULTS: Different social determinants influenced the mental health of women living in slum areas. Among the structural determinants, the socioeconomic level had the highest frequency, and gender was in the second rank with the highest correlation with poorer women's mental health status. Among the intermediate determinants, living conditions, food insecurity, social capital, and social support were most frequently associated with mental health status. CONCLUSION: Women living in slum areas are prone to developing mental disorders and poorer mental health; therefore, supporting these women and creating job opportunities to raise their incomes and, subsequently, improve their social, economic, and living conditions should be taken into consideration. In addition, this requires careful planning and comprehensive social support.

AB  - In addition to the many social, economic, cultural, security, and environmental problems in the metropolitan areas, suburbanization has led to the growth and spread of domestic violence against women, and is still increasing. Different social determinants can play a role in violence against suburban women, so this study was designed to investigate the social determinants of domestic violence in suburban women of developing countries. According to PRISMA guideline, the keywords, which were determined considering MESH, were searched in Google Scholar, MEDLINE, SID, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct with the 2009 to 2019 time limit. STROBE checklist was used for evaluating quantitative studies and JBI for qualitative studies. Finally 30 high quality studies were included. The prevalence of general domestic violence among women of different ages was reported between 2.3-73.78% in the suburban regions of developing countries. The prevalence of physical, emotional and psychological violence was about 11.54-61.6% and 7.8-84.3%. The prevalence of sexual, economic and the verbal violence was about 0.8-58.8%, 13.7-43.7% and 33.21-86.1%. The most common factors affecting violence against women were the structural factors of early marriage, the husband's addiction to alcohol and drugs. General domestic violence and its various types are prevalent in different parts of the world and the factors affecting domestic violence such as age, marriage age, low literacy, husband addiction to alcohol and drugs are all things that can be prevented by special health planning in these areas to improve women's health and thus prevent violence against suburban women.

AB  - Dysmenorrhea is one of the well-established problems among women of reproductive age and can have adverse effects on the quality of life of the individual. Some studies suggest a relationship between vitamin D (Vit D) and calcium deficiency and the emergence of early dysmenorrhea. Accordingly, a systematic study was performed to investigate the role of calcium and Vit D in the relief of primary dysmenorrhea. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar for papers published between 2010 and 2020. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklists were used to assess the quality of the studies. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool. Low calcium levels lead to an increase in uterine muscle contraction and can cause pain after decreased uterine blood flow. Furthermore, low levels of Vit D can increase primary dysmenorrhea by increasing prostaglandin production or reducing intestinal calcium absorption. That being the case, Vit D and calcium intake can be effective in reducing the severity of primary dysmenorrhea and in reducing the rate of analgesic use. Low levels of Vit D and calcium are inversely related to the severity of primary dysmenorrhea, and Vit D and calcium intake can reduce the severity of primary dysmenorrhea and its associated systemic symptoms. Therefore, the use of calcium and Vit D supplements can be recommended to relieve dysmenorrhea.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sexual dysfunction can adversely affect the quality of life and interpersonal relationships. nowadays, a lot of attention is paid to traditional Chinese medicine with better curative effects and less adverse events. Recent studies have implied the promising effect of acupuncture on sexual function. This systematic review evaluate the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture in treating female and male sexual dysfunction. CONTENT: PubMed, Cochrane Central of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched up to 2021. No limitation to language and date. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). SUMMARY: Among 160 initially assessed papers, 13 articles were included. The findings showed that acupuncture improve sexual dysfunction in domains of desire, libido, erectile dysfunction and impotency. Most studies did not report any serious side effects from acupuncture, and only three studies reported minor adverse events. OUTLOOK: The available evidence indicate that acupuncture has positive on improvement of sexual dysfunction with no serious side effects. Although acupuncture has gained increasing popularity for the management of sexual dysfunction, high methodological quality evidence regarding its efficacy is lacking.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of zinc supplementation on anthropometric measures. In this systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to August 2018 for relevant randomized controlled trials. Mean differences and SDs for each outcome were pooled using a random-effects model. Furthermore, a dose-response analysis for zinc dosage was performed using a fractional polynomial model. Quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Twenty-seven trials (n = 1438 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. There were no significant changes in anthropometric measures after zinc supplementation in the overall analysis. However, subgroup analyses revealed that zinc supplementation increased body weight in individuals undergoing hemodialysis (HD) [3 trials, n = 154 participants; weighted mean difference (WMD) = 1.02 kg; 95% CI: 0.38, 1.65 kg; P = 0.002; I2 = 11.4%] and decreased body weight in subjects who are overweight/obese but otherwise healthy (5 trials, n = 245 participants; WMD = -0.55 kg; 95% CI: -1.06, -0.04 kg; P = 0.03; I2 = 31.5%). Dose-response analyses revealed a significant nonlinear effect of supplementation dosage on BMI (P = 0.001). Our data suggest that zinc supplementation increases body weight in patients undergoing HD and decreases body weight in individuals who are overweight/obese but otherwise healthy, although after normalization for study duration, the association observed in subjects who are overweight/obese disappeared. Although more high-quality studies are needed to reach a definitive conclusion, our study supports the view that zinc may be associated with body weight.

AB  - The aim was to systematically review and meta-analyze prospective cohort studies investigating the relation between maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy with pregnancy and birth outcomes. PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science were searched from inception until October 2019 for eligible studies. Studies reporting relative risk, ORs, or incidences (for binary data) or means +/- SDs or B-coefficients (for continuous outcomes) comparing the highest and lowest adherence with maternal dietary patterns were included. Dietary patterns were categorized as "healthy," "unhealthy," or "mixed." No language restrictions were applied. Study-specific effect sizes with SEs for outcomes of interest were pooled using a random-effects model. Quality of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Sixty-six relevant publications were included. A higher maternal adherence to a healthy diet was associated with a reduced risk of gestational hypertension (14%, P < 0.001), maternal depression (40%, P = 0.004), low birth weight (28%, P = 0.001), preterm birth (56%, P < 0.001), higher gestational weight gain (Hedges' g: 0.15; P = 0.01), and birth weight (Hedges' g: 0.19; P = 0.007). Higher maternal adherence to an unhealthy or a mixed diet was associated with higher odds of gestational hypertension (23%, P < 0.001 for unhealthy, and 8%, P = 0.01 for mixed diet). In stratified analyses, a higher healthy eating index was associated with reduced odds of being large based on gestational age (31%, P = 0.02) and a higher head circumference at birth (0.23 cm, P = 0.02). The Mediterranean and "prudent" dietary patterns were related to lower odds of being small based on gestational age (46%, P = 0.04) and preterm birth (52%, P = 0.03), respectively. The overall GRADE quality of the evidence for most associations was low or very low, indicating that future high-quality research is warranted. This study was registered at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO as CRD42018089756.

AB  - Background: Improving the maternal health is one of the world's most challenging problems. Despite significant movements over the past decades, maternal health has been still considered as a central goal for sustainable development. Maternal near miss (MNM) cases experience long-term physical and psychological effects. To present a clear portrait of the current situation, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the purpose to assess the worldwide prevalence of MNM. Methods: We conducted a systematic review on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science electronic databases to find published papers in English, before March 2019 and regardless of the type of study. We, then, assessed the prevalence of MNM according to the World Health Organization(WHO) criteria. Finally, 49 papers were included in the study. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool the available prevalence. The quality of studies was also evaluated. Results: The weighted pooled worldwide prevalence of MNM, was 18.67/1000 (95% CI: 16.28-21.06). Heterogeneity was explored using subgroup analyses based on the continent and the country. We used meta-regression of MNM on MD which resulted in adjusted R-squared as78.88%. Conclusion: The prevalence of MNM was considerable. Low- and middle-income countries should develop systematic approaches to improve quality of care in the facilities and to reducethe risk of MNM events, with the hope to women's health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the psychological complications of mothers who have experienced severe maternal morbidity/maternal near miss (SMM/MNM) which can adversely affect the wellbeing of mothers, new born infants and other family members, but the risk level in this group is unclear. Therefore, we did a meta-analysis to ascertain the relationship PPD with MNM/SMM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors searched relevant studies in databases (Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Clinikalkey, Scopus).The summary odds ratio (OR) along with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated by use of random or fixed effects models. RESULTS: Four studies were included in qualitative synthesis. The pooled analysis revealed that PPD was significantly associated with an increased risk of MNM/SMM (OR = 1.83; 95% CI 1.37-2.44, p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: The results show that the risk of PPD in the MNM mothers are twice as likely as women without MNM. Therefore, more attention should be paid to psychological symptoms such as depression in MNM in order to reduce the long-term burden of maternal morbidity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and assess the quality of the economic evidence of adjuvant trastuzumab usage in early breast cancer in Asian countries. METHODS: Literature search was performed using 6 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, EconLit, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and ISI Web of Knowledge). The final search was performed in October 2018. All potential economic studies were then checked for eligibility. The reporting and methodological qualities of each study were independently assessed by 2 authors of this review, using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards, Drummond, and Philips checklists. To compare the different currencies used in these studies, all costs were converted into US dollars (2016). RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were included; most of them were performed from the healthcare provider perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for evaluation performed for a lifetime horizon were reported at $8573 and $20 816 per quality-adjusted life-year in 2 studies. The model outcome was generally sensitive to the changes in trastuzumab drug acquisition cost and discount rate, as well as its clinical effectiveness. For the quality assessment, all studies fulfilled more than 50% of the requirements in the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards, Drummond, and Philips checklists. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy is considered a cost-effective option for early breast cancer in Asian countries including China, Iran, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. All studies were generally well conducted. Economic evaluations from the societal perspective, with inclusion of indirect and informal care costs, are warranted to facilitate informed decision making among policy makers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Undernutrition is the outcome of insufficient food intake and recurrent infectious diseases. The baseline levels of undernutrition remain so high that Ethiopia still needs to continue substantial investment in nutrition. Therefore, the aim of this study was to obtain estimates of over-time trends in the prevalence of undernutrition in Ethiopia and to determine risk factors for undernutrition among children of under five years of age. METHODS: Cross-sectional studies published in English from 1997 to 2015 focusing the prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight in children aged 0-5 years (n = 39,585) in Ethiopia were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched in PubMed and Scopus databases and other articles manually. Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. The protocol number of the study is PROSPERO 2015: CRD42015027940. RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included and the overall pooled prevalence estimate of stunting, underweight and wasting was 42.0% (95% CI: 37.0, 46.0), 33.0 % (95% CI: 27.0, 39.0) and 15.0% (95% CI: 12.0, 19.0), respectively. The sensitivity analyses resulted in the prevalence of stunting, 40% (95% CI: 32.0, 48.0; I2=99.19%), prevalence of underweight, 33%(95% CI: 24.0, 42.0; I<sup>2</sup>=99.34%) and wasting rate equal to 19%(95% CI: 14.0, 24.0; I2=99.19%). Cumulative analysis revealed a stabilization trend of stunting and underweight (1996-2010) followed by an upward trend (2010-2014). Child age, child sex, complementary food, poor dietary diversity, diarrheal diseases, maternal education, maternal height, residential area and socio- economic status were significant risk factors for undernutrition. CONCLUSION: The result of the meta-analysis of thes observational studies revealed that the trend of undernutrition in Ethiopia indicates that there is an increment of chronic malnutrition cases in recent years, and the prevalence of undernutrition remains extremely high. Thus, the implementation of policies to reverse child undernutrition should get maximum emphasis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether treatment with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) improves periodontal clinical and glycemic outcomes in chronic periodontitis patients (CP) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: Databases (MEDLINE via PubMed; EMBASE; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register databases) were searched up to and including October 2016. The addressed PICO question was: "What are the effects of aPDT as an adjunct to SRP in terms of periodontal and glycemic outcomes as compared to SRP alone in individuals with DM?" RESULTS: Four randomized clinical trials were included in the present review. All studies reporting clinical periodontal and metabolic parameters, showed that aPDT was effective in the treatment of CP in DM subjects at follow up. Considering the effects of aPDT as an adjunct as compared to SRP alone on clinical signs of CP in DM subjects, no difference could be observed for all evaluated parameters (PD: Z=-0.61, P=0.54; CAL: Z=0.27, P=0.78; HbA1c: Z=0.138, P=0.89) CONCLUSION: It remains debatable whether aPDT is effective as an adjunct to SRP than SRP alone in patients having CP with DM, given that the scientific evidence is weak. In terms of periodontal parameters and glycemic levels, aPDT does not provide additional benefit in the treatment of CP in DM patients. However, further randomized clinical trials with standard laser parameters and long follow up periods are warranted to study periodontal and glycemic outcomes in this regard.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of adjunctive use of laser therapy (LT) alone or antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) to improve clinical periodontal and HbA1c levels in patients with both chronic periodontitis (CP) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Electronic search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Science Direct, and SCOPUS databases were combined with hand searching of articles published from 1975 up to and including March 2016 using relevant MeSH terms. Six studies were selected for this review. In these six studies, laser treatment was applied, after scaling and root planing (SRP), in two ways: Three studies used laser alone and three studies used laser with photosensitizer. All the six included studies reporting clinical periodontal and glycemic parameters showed that LT and aPDT were effective in the treatment of CP in T2DM subjects at follow-up. Two studies showed significantly better periodontal outcomes for LT as an adjunct to SRP as compared to SRP alone, whereas four studies showed comparable periodontal outcomes among adjunctive LT or aPDT with SRP. Two studies showed significant reduction of HbA1c levels in LT and aPDT as compared to SRP, whereas three studies showed comparable percentage levels at follow-up. It remains debatable whether LT or aPDT as adjunct to SRP is more effective as compared to SRP alone in the improvement of clinical periodontal and glycemic control in patients with both CP and T2DM, given that the scientific evidence is weak.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Outcomes for debulking by atherectomy (ATH) for adjunctive treatment of below the knee (BTK) symptomatic arterial disease compared to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone (PTA) are unclear. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were queried from between 2000 and 2017 including studies comparing PTA alone to PTA-ATH. Random effect meta-analysis model was used to pool the data across the studies. Study endpoints included: vessel dissection, residual stenosis (<30%), mortality at 12months and amputation rates at 1 and 12months. RESULTS: A total of 2587 patients (72.9years; 63% male) were included from 4 studies (2 prospective, one of which was randomized, and 2 retrospective) comparing PTA alone to ATH-PTA in patients with symptomatic infra-popliteal disease. There was no significant difference between the two approaches in terms of vessel dissection [OR 3.73 with 95% CI 0.83 to 16.64, p=0.08] or residual stenosis [OR 0.41 with 95% CI 0.11 to 1.60, p=0.18]. Clinical outcomes did not differ in terms of 12month mortality [OR 3.47 with 95% CI 0.15 to 81.37, p=0.44], or limb amputation at 1month [OR 1.23 with 95% CI 0.91 to 1.67, p=0.18] or 12months [OR: 1.02 with 95% CI 0.83 to 1.26, p=0.83]. CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing (BTK) intervention, PTA alone and ATH-PTA was associated with similar outcomes in terms of vessel dissection and residual stenosis, mortality at 12months, and limb amputation at 1 or 12months.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been implicated with efficacy and safety concerns. Evidence on the role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in this population is limited. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched and articles comparing the safety and efficacy of warfarin with apixaban or rivaroxaban were identified. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) were computed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of eight articles consisting of 30,806 patients; (rivaroxaban 2196, apixaban 2745 and warfarin 25,865) were identified. The pooled HR for major bleeding events favored apixaban over warfarin (0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-0.84, p = 0.008). Apixaban was similar to warfarin in terms of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.64-1.84, p = 0.77) and stroke events (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.85, 1.39, p = 0.99). There was no significant difference in the risk of major bleeding events (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.50-1.81, p = 0.88) and stroke between rivaroxaban (HR 1.39, 95% CI, 0.59-3.29, p = 0.09) and warfarin. The combined results of major bleeding in the apixaban group were not affected by the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban may have a lower risk of major bleeding and comparable risk of stroke when compared with warfarin in AF patients with ESRD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the infection rate of COVID-19 is very high, all the patients getting infected don't always die or go through brutal states. This indicates there may be some factors that possibly boost the severity of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We intend to identify some probable risk factors that are responsible for the severity of COVID-19 using a meta-analysis. METHODS: The literature exploration lasted up to 18 April 2020 and through PubMed,Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library we have identified 10 pertinent publications. To paraphrase the outcomes of autonomous researches, we have performed a random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: Among 2272 patients' information extracted from the selected literature majority (60%) are male patients. This study found sex (male) (Risk ratio [RR] =1.29, 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.54), hypertension (RR=1.79, 95% CI, 1.57 to 2.04), diabetes (RR=1.57, 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.98), fatigue or myalgia (RR=1.17, 95% CI, 1.02; 1.35), and smoking history (RR=1.71, 95% CI,1.25; 2.35) are potential risk factors for the severity of COVID-19. We found fever (RR=1.21, 95% CI, 0.66 to 2.22), cough (1.13, 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.30), and diarrhea (RR=1.14, 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.40) as insignificant risk factors for COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of this research may be beneficial to identify patients with higher risks to provide additional medical attention from the very beginning of the treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is currently considered the main risk to global health. A variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic and periodontal infections. However, clinical endodontic and periodontics bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance. We aim to assess the existing evidence to estimate the prevalence of the main antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistant organisms in endodontics and periodontics and to describe their geographic distribution in Latin America. METHODS: All types of designs and will be restricted to Latin American studies will be included in this systematic review. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, BVS (LILACS, BBO - bvsalud.org), IBECS (bases.bireme.br), Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases will be searched from 2013 to December 31, 2018 for all types of study designs that report microbial infection in endodontics and periodontics and their resistance and that define the microbiological methods used to identify microorganisms. The selection of articles for inclusion will be performed by 2 reviewers using predefined eligibility criteria. The Cochrane and ROBINS-I risk of bias assessment tools will be used to assess the methodological quality of randomized control trials. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale will be used to assess the quality of methodology in observational studies. The overall quality of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) using the same principles and domains applied in the quality assessment of prognostic studies. The heterogeneity of the findings will be assessed using both the chi test and the I statistic. Sensitivity analysis will be performed by subgroup analyses and meta-regression to investigate the effect of study-level characteristics, such as age, gender, and methodological quality score, whenever possible. Publication bias across studies will be evaluated by visual inspection of the funnel plots and Begg's test for the results covered in 10 or more studies. RESULTS: The evidence derived by this study will inform best practices for patients with endodontic and periodontal problems receiving antimicrobial agents. CONCLUSION: Successful completion will significantly impact clinical practice and contribute to improved prescribing competency. Protocol registration: Prospero-crd42018077810.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Air-pollution and weather exposure beyond certain thresholds have serious effects on public health. Yet, there is lack of information on wider aspects including the role of some effect modifiers and the interaction between air-pollution and weather. This article aims at a comprehensive review and narrative summary of literature on the association of air-pollution and weather with mortality and hospital admissions; and to highlight literature gaps that require further research. METHODS: We conducted a scoping literature review. The search on two databases (PubMed and Web-of-Science) from 2012 to 2020 using three conceptual categories of "environmental factors", "health outcomes", and "Geographical region" revealed a total of 951 records. The narrative synthesis included all original studies with time-series, cohort, or case cross-over design; with ambient air-pollution and/or weather exposure; and mortality and/or hospital admission outcomes. RESULTS: The final review included 112 articles from which 70 involved mortality, 30 hospital admission, and 12 studies included both outcomes. Air-pollution was shown to act consistently as risk factor for all-causes, cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular and cancer mortality and hospital admissions. Hot and cold temperature was a risk factor for wide range of cardiovascular, respiratory, and psychiatric illness; yet, in few studies, the increase in temperature reduced the risk of hospital admissions for pulmonary embolism, angina pectoris, chest, and ischemic heart diseases. The role of effect modification in the included studies was investigated in terms of gender, age, and season but not in terms of ethnicity. CONCLUSION: Air-pollution and weather exposure beyond certain thresholds affect human health negatively. Effect modification of important socio-demographics such as ethnicity and the interaction between air-pollution and weather is often missed in the literature. Our findings highlight the need of further research in the area of health behaviour and mortality in relation to air-pollution and weather, to guide effective environmental health precautionary measures planning.

AB  - Several studies have investigated serum zinc levels in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), but the results of these studies remain inconclusive. Therefore, to derive a more precise estimation, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate serum zinc concentrations in women with PCOS in comparison with healthy subjects. Electronic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar up to April; 4, 2018 without any restriction. Eligible studies that evaluated the levels of zinc status in subjects with PCOS were included. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) with corresponding 95% CIs in serum zinc levels were initially estimated using a random-effects model. Eight studies, measuring circulating zinc levels in 552 PCOS and 464 control subjects, were included. Pooled effect size suggested that serum zinc levels in women with PCOS were not statistically different than their controls (WMD = -4.43 mg/dL; 95% CI = [-10.30, 1.44]; P = 0.139). Exclusion of one study revealed that women with PCOS significantly have lower serum zinc levels compared to healthy controls (WMD: -6.60 mg/dL; 95% CI = [-12.43, -0.76], P = 0.027). Our study indicated that circulating zinc levels in women with PCOS were significantly lower than those in healthy controls when detailed analysis is conducted. Large scale studies are needed to elucidate clear relation between zinc status and etiology of PCOS.

No reviews have yet assessed the outcomes of IE patients undergoing short- and long-term outcome evaluation, such as all-cause mortality and IE-related complications. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the short- and long-term mortality, as well as IE-related complications in patients with definite IE. METHODS: A computerized systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar from 2000 to August, 2016. Included studies were published studies in English that assessed short-and long-term mortality for adult IE patients. Pooled estimations with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated with DerSimonian-Laird (DL) random-effects model. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also performed. Publication bias was evaluated using inspection of funnel plots and statistical tests. RESULTS: Twenty five observational studies (retrospective, 14; prospective, 11) including 22,382 patients were identified. The overall pooled mortality estimates for IE patients who underwent short- and long-term follow-up were 20% (95% CI: 18.0-23.0, P < 0.01) and 37% (95% CI: 27.0-48.0, P < 0.01), respectively. The pooled prevalence of cardiac complications in patients with IE was found to be 39% (95%CI: 32.0-46.0) while septic embolism and renal complications accounted for 25% (95% CI: 20.0-31) and 19% (95% CI: 14.0-25.0) (all P < 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the follow-up period, a significantly higher mortality rate was reported in IE patients, and the burden of IE-related complications were immense. Further research is needed to assess the determinants of overall mortality in IE patients, as well as well-designed observational studies to conform our results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify domains that determine quality of life in patients with peripheral arterial disease and find the patient-reported outcome measures that can examine the identified themes. METHODS: A systematic review of all the main six databases was undertaken to identify primary qualitative studies reporting on the health and/or quality of life of patients with peripheral arterial disease. The quality of studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program criteria. Findings from the included studies were analysed using framework analysis methodology. The identified themes were mapped against the items/domains of validated patient-reported outcome measures used in patients with peripheral arterial disease. RESULTS: The systematic review identified eight papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The included papers reported the views of 186 patients with peripheral arterial disease including patients with intermittent claudication, critical ischaemia and amputation secondary to peripheral arterial disease. The overall quality of the included studies was good based on Critical Appraisal Skills Program criteria. Framework analysis identified 35 themes that were divided into six main groups: symptoms, impact on physical functioning, impact on social functioning, psychological impact, financial impact and process of care. The best-fit generic and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures were the Nottingham Health Profile and the Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire, respectively. None of the patient-reported outcome measures covered all the themes important to patients with peripheral arterial disease. DISCUSSION: The findings from the review identified the important domains that affect patients living with peripheral arterial disease. None of the current generic and disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures provide a comprehensive measure for all themes that impact the daily living of patients with peripheral arterial disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify themes that determine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with carotid artery stenosis and identify the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that best cover the identified themes. METHODS: A systematic review of the main six databases from inception to September 2018 was undertaken to identify primary qualitative studies reporting on the HRQoL of patients with carotid artery stenosis. The quality of studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) criteria. Findings from the included studies were analysed using framework analysis methodology. The identified themes were mapped against the items/domains from the PROMs used previously in patients with carotid artery stenosis. RESULTS: The systematic review identified four papers that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The included papers reported the views of 62 patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis; 24 of the patients were awaiting assessment for intervention, 26 had carotid endarterectomy, and 12 were turned down for intervention and received best medical therapy. The overall quality of the included studies was good based on CASP criteria. Framework analysis identified 16 themes that were divided into five main domains: anxiety, impact on personal roles and activities, effect on independence, psychological impact, and symptoms. The best-fit generic and disease-specific PROMs were the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36<sup> R</sup>) and the Carotid Stenosis Specific Outcome Measure (CSSOM), respectively. None of the PROMs covered all the themes identified in the qualitative systematic review. CONCLUSION: The findings from the review identified the important themes that affect patients with carotid stenosis disease. The current generic and disease-specific PROMs do not cover all themes that impact the HRQoL of patients suffering with this disease. The proposed themes can be used to develop a new disease-specific PROM to measure HRQoL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight loss interventions for obesity, such as bariatric surgery, are associated with reductions in bone mineral density and may increase the risk of fractures. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of bariatric surgery and lifestyle weight management programs (WMPs) with fracture outcomes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1966 to 2018, and our trial registry of WMP randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We included RCTs, non-randomized trials, and observational studies of bariatric surgery, and RCTs of WMPs. Studies had follow-up >= 12 months, mean group body mass index >= 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The primary outcome measure was incidence of any type of fracture in participants, and the secondary outcome was weight change. We used random effects meta-analysis for trial data. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included. Three small trials provided short-term evidence of the association between bariatric surgery and participants with any fracture (365 participants; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.35). Four out of six observational studies of bariatric surgery demonstrated significantly increased fracture risk. Six RCTs of WMPs with 6214 participants, the longest follow-up 11.3 years, showed no clear effect on any type of fracture (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.18), although authors of the largest RCT reported an increased risk of frailty fracture by their definition (RR 1.40; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.90). CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery appears to increase the risk of any fracture; however, longer-term trial data are needed. The effect of lifestyle WMPs on the risk of any fracture is currently unclear.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Joint mobilization is a non-pharmacological technique used to treat chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, it is controversial due to a lack of studies comparing its effects on this painful condition. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of bias in clinical trials investigating the effect of joint mobilization on chronic musculoskeletal pain. CONTENTS: A systematic search on Pubmed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, Scielo, PEDro, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, LILACS, BVS, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed on September 2019 from the combination of three keywords: Musculoskeletal Manipulations AND Chronic Pain AND Musculoskeletal Pain. Randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluated the use of joint mobilization associated or not to other therapies in chronic musculoskeletal pain treatment were included. Five thousand five hundred eighty-seven articles were screened, and 14 studies were analyzed, including 812 participants, with a mean age of 54 years, and female being the most affected. According to these articles, joint mobilization promoted the reduction of pain intensity in short and long terms, increase in range of motion, strength and function when used alone or in association with conventional physiotherapy. Regarding methodological quality, most of the studies were classified with low risk for selection, performance, detection and reporting bias. In the "other bias" item, which considered therapists experience time and types of treatment applied, only one study presented low risk and other study presented an unclear risk. CONCLUSION: Joint mobilization seems to be an effective technique for the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, it is still necessary to investigate and compile studies with greater methodological quality, thus promoting greater support to evidence-based practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review systematically all the available evidence on efficacy and safety of cannabinoids for treating neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Studies were identified by electronic search of the Cochrane register, Embase, Medline, Scopus (last search on 11 November 2016). RESULTS: After screening 8 469 articles, we included two randomized controlled trials and one open-label study, in which a total of 426 patients were enrolled. Cannabinoids relevantly decreased the number of incontinence episodes in all three studies. Pooling data showed the mean difference in incontinence episodes per 24 h to be -0.35 (95% confidence interval -0.46 to -0.24). Mild adverse events were frequent (38-100%), but only two patients (0.7%) reported a serious adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data imply that cannabinoids might be an effective and safe treatment option for NLUTD in patients with MS; however, the evidence base is poor and more high-quality, well-designed and adequately powered and sampled studies are urgently needed to reach definitive conclusions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature comparing fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements after administration of adenosine using intracoronary (IC) bolus versus standard continuous intravenous (IV) infusion. BACKGROUND: FFR is considered the gold standard for invasive assessment of coronary lesions of intermediate severity. IV adenosine is recommended to induce hyperemia; however, IC adenosine is widely used for convenience. The difference between IV and IC administration in lesions assessment is not well studied. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE and relevant databases for studies comparing IV with IC adenosine administration for FFR measurement. We reviewed data pertaining to adenosine doses, side effects, and FFR values. RESULTS: Eight studies addressing the primary question were identified. Dose of IC adenosine varied between 36 and 600 mug. Compared to IV adenosine infusion, the sensitivity of IC administration is 0.805 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.664-0.896; p < .001), specificity is 0.965 (95% CI: 0.932-0.983; p < .001), positive likelihood ratio is 24.218 (95% CI: 12,263-47.830; p < .001), negative likelihood ratio is 0.117 (95% CI: 0.033-0.411; p < .01), and diagnostic odds ratio is 274.225 [95% CI: 92.731-810.946; p < .001]. Overall, hemodynamic side effects and symptoms were reported more frequently with IV adenosine. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature suggests that IC adenosine is well tolerated and may provide equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared to IV administration. However, variability in dosing regimens does not allow definitive conclusions regarding noninferiority of IC approach compared to IV administration.

AB  - The optimal dosing schedule to maintain the effectiveness of sunitinib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma - while reducing toxicity - remains an important clinical question. A meta-analysis of randomized trials and observational studies assessed the relative treatment effects of 4/2, 2/1 and transitional-2/1 schedules on outcomes and adverse events using Bayesian network meta-analysis methods. Treatment with 2/1 reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 25% and had lower odds of hand-and-foot syndrome compared with the 4/2. A numerical but not 'statistical' benefit in progression-free survival was observed with the transitional-2/1 compared with 4/2. Alternative schedules with the 2/1 and transitional-2/1 may be more clinically beneficial in metastatic renal cell carcinoma than the 4/2 schedule.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) is the first line treatment modality for a significant proportion of patients with upper urinary tracts stones. Simple analgesics, opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are all suitable agents but the relative efficacy and tolerability of these agents is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of the different types of analgesics used for the control of pain during SWL for urinary stones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and also hand-searched reference lists of relevant articles (Figure-1). Randomised controlled trials (RCT's) comparing the use of any opioid, simple analgesic or NSAID during SWL were included. These were compared with themselves, each-other or placebo. We included any route or form of administration (bolus, PCA). We excluded agents that were used for their sedative qualities. Data were extracted and assessed for quality independently by three reviewers. Meta-analyses have been performed where possible. When not possible, descriptive analyses of variables were performed. Dichotomous outcomes are reported as relative risk (RR) and measurements on continuous scales are reported as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Overall, we included 9 RCTs (539 participants from 6 countries). Trial agents included 7 types of NSAIDs, 1 simple analgesic and 4 types of opioids. There were no significant differences in clinical efficacy or tolerability between a simple analgesic (paracetamol) and an NSAID (lornoxicam). When comparing the same simple analgesic with an opioid (tramadol), both agents provided safe and effective analgesia for the purpose of SWL with no significant differences. There were no significant differences in pain scores between NSAIDs or opioids in three studies. Adequate analgesia could be achieved more often for opioids than for NSAIDs (RR 0.358; 95% CI 043 to 0.77, P=0.0002) but consumed doses of rescue analgesia were similar between NSAIDs and opioids in two studies (P=0.58, >0.05). In terms of tolerability, there is no difference in post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) between the groups (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.17, P=0.55). One study compared outcomes between two types of NSAIDs (diclofenac versus dexketoprofen). There were no significant differences in any of our pre-defined outcomes measures. CONCLUSION: Simple analgesics, NSAIDs and opioids can all reduce the pain associated with shock wave lithotripsy to a level where the procedure is tolerated. Whilst there are no compelling differences in safety or efficacy of simple analgesics and NSAIDs, analgesia is described as adequate more often for opioids than NSAIDs.

AB  - Use of alpha-blockers for medical expulsive therapy (MET) has been the subject of huge debate in urology. Moreover, there have been a number of randomized controlled trials with differing results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials investigating the efficacy of alpha-blockers for MET. This review confirms there is a role for alpha-blockers in MET for ureteric stones specifically in stones >5 mm and distal ureteric stones, which is associated with improved stone expulsion. However, there is a slight increase in risk of nonsignificant side effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryoablation has emerged as an alternative to the more invasive partial nephrectomy for small renal masses. The approach can be carried out by two techniques, either laparoscopic cryoablation (LCA) or percutaneous cryoablation, (PCA) with CT guidance. We aimed to compare between the two procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted, including studies comparing the two techniques. Outcomes included incomplete ablation, late local recurrence, cancer-specific survival, procedure time, transfusion rates, hospital stay, and complications. RESULTS: A total of 1475 patients were included, 788 patients in the laparoscopic group and 687 patients in the percutaneous group. There was statistical difference favoring the laparoscopic group with regard to having less incomplete ablation (p = 0.0008) and higher cancer-specific survival patients (p = 0.04). However, there was longer hospital stays in the LCA group (p < 0.00001) and was found to be more costly than the PCA group. There was significantly more Clavien-I complications in the PCA group (p = 0.001) and more Clavien-III complications in the LCA group (p = 0.001). Otherwise, there were no differences in any other outcome parameter. CONCLUSION: LCA was found to have less incomplete tumor ablation rates and higher cancer-specific survival rates, however, higher hospitalization time, more major complications (Clavien III), and was costlier compared with PCA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) are orthotic devices that can be used to normalize the walking pattern of children with cerebral palsy (CP). One of the aims of orthotic management is to produce a more normal gait pattern by positioning joints in the proper position to reduce pathological reflex or spasticity. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the literature and establish the effect of treatment with various types of AFOs on gait patterns of children with CP. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of knowledge, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched for articles published between 2007 and 2015 of studies of children with CP wearing the following AFOs: hinged (HAFO), solid (SAFO), floor reaction (FRO), posterior leaf spring (PLS) and dynamic (DAFO). Studies that combined treatment options were excluded. Outcomes investigated were a change in gait pattern and subsequent walking ability. The PEDro scale used to assess the methodological quality of relevant studies. RESULTS: We included 17 studies investigating a total of 1139 children with CP. The PEDro score was poor for most studies (3/10). Only 4 studies, of 209 children in total, were randomized controlled trials, for a good PEDro score (5, 7, 9/10) and an appropriate level of evidence. One study used a case-based series and the remainder a cross-sectional design. In general, the use of AFOs improved speed and stride length. The HAFO was effective for improving gait parameters and decreasing energy expenditure with hemiplegic CP as compared with the barefoot condition. It also improved stride length, speed of walking, single limb support and gait symmetry with hemiplegic CP. The plastic SAFO and FRO were effective in reducing energy expenditure with diplegic CP. With diplegic CP, the HAFO and SAFO improved gross motor function. CONCLUSION: For children with CP, use of specific types of AFOs improved gait parameters, including ankle and knee range of motion, walking speed and stride length. AFOs reduced energy expenditure in children with spastic CP. However, further studies with good PEDro scores are required for more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of AFOs in children with CP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thoracic hyperkyphosis is one of the most common spinal disorders in older people, creating impairment, postural instability, gait disorders and a reduced quality of life. The use of spinal orthoses and/or postural taping may be feasible conservative interventions, but their efficacy is uncertain. The aim of this review is therefore to investigate the effectiveness of spinal orthoses and taping on the balance and gait of older people with hyperkyphosis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will include randomised controlled trials and clinical trial studies which assess the efficacy of spinal orthoses and taping using the WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) outcome measures in older people with hyperkyphosis of the thoracic spine. A search will be performed in PubMed, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Knowledge, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, PEDro, REHAB DATA and RECAL databases with no restriction of language. Two independent reviewers will perform the study selection and data extraction. Quality assessment will be implemented using modified Down and Black checklists. Publication bias and data synthesis will be assessed by funnel plots, Begg's and Egger's tests, and plots using STATA software V.12.1 version. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical issues are predicted. These findings will be published in a peer reviewed journal and presented at national and international conferences. Prospero registration number: Crd42016045880.

AB  - OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The objective was to determine the prevalence and clinical determinants of renal artery stenosis (RAS) in patients undergoing digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the assessment of peripheral artery disease (PAD), and to evaluate its prognostic significance. METHODS: All DSAs performed from January 2000 to January 2006 were retrospectively reviewed for assessment of PAD in patients naive for any prior revascularisation of lower-limb arteries. All DSA studies were read by two senior physicians blinded to outcome, and consensus was reached in cases of disagreement. RAS was defined as the presence of >=50% stenosis in either renal artery. Patients' electronic medical files were systematically reviewed and follow-up was completed by contact with family physicians until January 2014. The primary outcome was composite, including death, peripheral revascularisation, or any limb amputation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, and another composite, including death and non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke or coronary or carotid revascularisation. RESULTS: In total, 400 consecutive patients having a first DSA of lower extremities, two thirds of whom were for critical limb ischaemia, were studied. Thirteen patients were excluded owing to poor renal artery imaging. RAS was detected in 57 patients (14%). Only two factors were independently and significantly associated with RAS in multivariate analysis: diffuse PAD (involving both proximal and distal segments [odds ratio {OR} 3.50, 95% confidence interval {CI} 1.16-10.54; p = .026]) and decreased glomerular filtration rate (OR 0.55 per 30 mL/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 95% CI 0.41-0.75; p < .001). During follow-up (mean +/- SD 62 +/- 47 months), 25% experienced limb amputation and 54% died. In multivariate analysis, no significant association was found between RAS and primary outcome (hazard ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.57-1.10). No significant association was found with secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Incidental RAS is frequent (14%) among patients with PAD undergoing lower extremity imaging. No difference in outcome in patients with RAS versus those without RAS was seen. Larger studies are necessary to draw definite conclusions.

AB  - - Background People with abdominal aortic aneurysm who receive endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) need lifetime surveillance to detect potential endoleaks. Endoleak is defined as persistent blood flow within the aneurysm sac following EVAR. Computed tomography (CT) angiography is considered the reference standard for endoleak surveillance. Colour duplex ultrasound (CDUS) and contrast‐enhanced CDUS (CE‐CDUS) are less invasive but considered less accurate than CT. Objectives To determine the diagnostic accuracy of colour duplex ultrasound (CDUS) and contrast‐enhanced‐colour duplex ultrasound (CE‐CDUS) in terms of sensitivity and specificity for endoleak detection after endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, ISI Conference Proceedings, Zetoc, and trial registries in June 2016 without language restrictions and without use of filters to maximize sensitivity. Selection criteria Any cross‐sectional diagnostic study evaluating participants who received EVAR by both ultrasound (with or without contrast) and CT scan assessed at regular intervals. Data collection and analysis Two pairs of review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality of included studies using the QUADAS 1 tool. A third review author resolved discrepancies. The unit of analysis was number of participants for the primary analysis and number of scans performed for the secondary analysis. We carried out a meta‐analysis to estimate sensitivity and specificity of CDUS or CE‐CDUS using a bivariate model. We analysed each index test separately. As potential sources of heterogeneity, we explored year of publication, characteristics of included participants (age and gender), direction of the study (retrospective, prospective), country of origin, number of CDUS operators, and ultrasound manufacturer. Main results We identified 42 primary studies with 4220 participants. Twenty studies provided accuracy data based on the number of individual participants (seven of which provided data with and without the use of contrast). Sixteen of these studies evaluated the accuracy of CDUS. These studies were generally of moderate to low quality: only three studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; in six (40%) of the studies, the delay between the tests was unclear or longer than four weeks; in eight (50%), the blinding of either the index test or the reference standard was not clearly reported or was not performed; and in two studies (12%), the interpretation of the reference standard was not clearly reported. Eleven studies evaluated the accuracy of CE‐CDUS. These studies were of better quality than the CDUS studies: five (45%) studies fulfilled all the QUADAS items; four (36%) did not report clearly the blinding interpretation of the reference standard; and two (18%) did not clearly report the delay between the two tests. Based on the bivariate model, the summary estimates for CDUS were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.91) for sensitivity and 0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.96) for specificity whereas for CE‐CDUS the estimates were 0.94 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.98) for sensitivity and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98) for specificity. Regression analysis showed that CE‐CDUS was superior to CDUS in terms of sensitivity (LR Chi 2 = 5.08, 1 degree of freedom (df); P = 0.0242 for model improvement). Seven studies provided estimates before and after administration of contrast. Sensitivity before contrast was 0.67 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.83) and after contrast was 0.97 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). The improvement in sensitivity with of contrast use was statistically significant (LR Chi 2 = 13.47, 1 df; P = 0.0002 for model improvement). Regression testing showed evidence of statistically significant effect bias related to year of publication and study quality within individual participants based CDUS studies. Sensitivity estimates were higher in the studies published before 2006 than the estimates obtained from studies published in 2006 or later (P < 0.001); and studies judged as low/unclear q ality provided higher estimates in sensitivity. When regression testing was applied to the individual based CE‐CDUS studies, none of the items, namely direction of the study design, quality, and age, were identified as a source of heterogeneity. Twenty‐two studies provided accuracy data based on number of scans performed (of which four provided data with and without the use of contrast). Analysis of the studies that provided scan based data showed similar results. Summary estimates for CDUS (18 studies) showed 0.72 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.85) for sensitivity and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.96) for specificity whereas summary estimates for CE‐CDUS (eight studies) were 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.98) for sensitivity and 0.89 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.96) for specificity. Authors' conclusions This review demonstrates that both ultrasound modalities (with or without contrast) showed high specificity. For ruling in endoleaks, CE‐CDUS appears superior to CDUS. In an endoleak surveillance programme CE‐CDUS can be introduced as a routine diagnostic modality followed by CT scan only when the ultrasound is positive to establish the type of endoleak and the subsequent therapeutic management. Plain language summary Ultrasonography versus computed tomography scan for endoleak detection after endoluminal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair Background An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localised swelling or widening of a major vessel that carries blood to the abdomen (tummy), pelvis, and legs. People with AAA are at risk from sudden death due to AAA rupture (bursting). Once detected, intervention (treatment) is recommended once the AAA is bigger than about 5 cm in diameter. Most repairs are now performed using a new vessel lining inside the aneurysm guided by x‐ray control (endovascular aneurysm repair or EVAR). Once the new lining is in place, the seals at either end may leak or vessel branches arising from the aneurysm wall may bleed backwards into the AAA sac. These are collectively referred to as endoleaks. Endoleaks are common after EVAR, developing in about 40% of people during monitoring (follow‐up). Endoleaks can be associated with late aneurysm rupture and, therefore, detection and monitoring is essential. Ultrasound (uses high‐frequency sound waves), computed tomography (uses x‐rays), and magnetic resonance scans (uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves) have all been used to detect and monitor endoleaks. Sometimes, dye (contrast) is injected into a vein to improve the accuracy of ultrasound (contrast‐enhanced ultrasound). Study characteristics We collected the most recent evidence (to July 2016) and conducted a meta‐analysis according to the most appropriate methods for diagnostic tests. We included 42 studies with 4220 participants in the review. Key results The analyses measured sensitivity (how well a test identified people with endoleak correctly) and specificity (how well a test identified people without endoleak correctly). The summary accuracy estimates were sensitivity 82% (95% confidence interval 66% to 91%) and specificity 93% (95% confidence interval 87% to 96%) for ultrasonography without contrast; and sensitivity 94% (95% confidence interval 85% to 98%) and specificity 95% (95% confidence interval 90% to 98%) for ultrasonography with contrast. Use of contrast improved the sensitivity of ultrasound significantly. Based on these results, we would expect 94% of people with endoleaks will be correctly identified by contrast‐enhanced ultrasound. Quality of the evidence Studies that evaluated contrast‐enhanced ultrasound used better methods than the studies that evaluated ultrasound alone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverticular disease is a common condition in Western industrialised countries. Most individuals remain asymptomatic throughout life; however, 25% experience acute diverticulitis. The standard treatment for acute diverticulitis is open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery - a minimal-access procedure - offers an alternative approach to open surgery, as it is characterised by reduced operative stress that may translate into shorter hospitalisation and more rapid recovery, as well as improved quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of laparoscopic surgical resection compared with open surgical resection for individuals with acute sigmoid diverticulitis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2) in the Cochrane Library; Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 23 February 2017); Ovid Embase (1974 to 23 February 2017); clinicaltrials.gov (February 2017); and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry (February 2017). We reviewed the bibliographies of identified trials to search for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing elective or emergency laparoscopic sigmoid resection versus open surgical resection for acute sigmoid diverticulitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the domains of risk of bias from each included trial, and extracted data. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, we planned to calculate mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs for outcomes such as hospital stay, and standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for quality of life and global rating scales, if researchers used different scales. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials with 392 participants met the inclusion criteria. Studies were conducted in three European countries (Switzerland, Netherlands, and Germany). The median age of participants ranged from 62 to 66 years; 53% to 64% were female. Inclusion criteria differed among studies. One trial included participants with Hinchey I characteristics as well as those who underwent Hartmann's procedure; the second trial included only participants with "a proven stage II/III disease according to the classification of Stock and Hansen"; the third trial considered for inclusion patients with "diverticular disease of sigmoid colon documented by colonoscopy and 2 episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis, one at least being documented with CT scan, 1 episode of complicated diverticulitis, with a pericolic abscess (Hinchey stage I) or pelvic abscess (Hinchey stage II) requiring percutaneous drainage."We determined that two studies were at low risk of selection bias; two that reported considerable dropouts were at high risk of attrition bias; none reported blinding of outcome assessors (unclear detection bias); and all were exposed to performance bias owing to the nature of the intervention.Available low-quality evidence suggests that laparoscopic surgical resection may lead to little or no difference in mean hospital stay compared with open surgical resection (3 studies, 360 participants; MD -0.62 (days), 95% CI -2.49 to 1.25; I² = 0%).Low-quality evidence suggests that operating time was longer in the laparoscopic surgery group than in the open surgery group (3 studies, 360 participants; MD 49.28 (minutes), 95% CI 40.64 to 57.93; I² = 0%).We are uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery improves postoperative pain between day 1 and day 3 more effectively than open surgery. Low-quality evidence suggests that laparoscopic surgery may improve postoperative pain at the fourth postoperative day more effectively than open surgery (2 studies, 250 participants; MD = -0.65, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.25).Researchers reported quality of life differently across trials, hindering the possibility of meta-analysis. Low-quality evidence from one trial using the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire six weeks after surgery sugg sts that laparoscopic intervention may improve quality of life, whereas evidence from two other trials using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) v3 and the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score, respectively, suggests that laparoscopic surgery may make little or no difference in improving quality of life compared with open surgery.We are uncertain whether laparoscopic surgery improves the following outcomes: 30-day postoperative mortality, early overall morbidity, major and minor complications, surgical complications, postoperative times to liquid and solid diets, and reoperations due to anastomotic leak. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present comprehensive review indicate that evidence to support or refute the safety and effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgical resection for treatment of patients with acute diverticular disease is insufficient. Well-designed trials with adequate sample size are needed to investigate the efficacy of laparoscopic surgery towards important patient-oriented (e.g. postoperative pain) and health system-oriented outcomes (e.g. mean hospital stay).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the accuracy of administrative datasets to identify primary diagnoses of breast cancer based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th or 10th revision codes. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (April 2017). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: The inclusion criteria were: (a) the presence of a reference standard; (b) the presence of at least one accuracy test measure (eg, sensitivity) and (c) the use of an administrative database. DATA EXTRACTION: Eligible studies were selected and data extracted independently by two reviewers; quality was assessed using the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy criteria. DATA ANALYSIS: Extracted data were synthesised using a narrative approach. RESULTS: From 2929 records screened 21 studies were included (data collection period between 1977 and 2011). Eighteen studies evaluated ICD-9 codes (11 of which assessed both invasive breast cancer (code 174.x) and carcinoma in situ (ICD-9 233.0)); three studies evaluated invasive breast cancer-related ICD-10 codes. All studies except one considered incident cases. The initial algorithm results were: sensitivity >=80% in 11 of 17 studies (range 57%-99%); positive predictive value was >=83% in 14 of 19 studies (range 15%-98%) and specificity >=98% in 8 studies. The combination of the breast cancer diagnosis with surgical procedures, chemoradiation or radiation therapy, outpatient data or physician claim may enhance the accuracy of the algorithms in some but not all circumstances. Accuracy for breast cancer based on outpatient or physician's data only or breast cancer diagnosis in secondary position diagnosis resulted low. CONCLUSION: Based on the retrieved evidence, administrative databases can be employed to identify primary breast cancer. The best algorithm suggested is ICD-9 or ICD-10 codes located in primary position. Trial registration number: Crd42015026881.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a common and serious neuropsychiatric syndrome, characterised by progressive cognitive and functional decline. The majority of people with dementia develop behavioural disturbances, also known as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Several non-pharmacological interventions have been evaluated to treat BPSD in people with dementia. Simulated presence therapy (SPT), an intervention that uses video or audiotape recordings of family members played to the person with dementia, is a possible approach to treat BPSD. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of SPT on behavioural and psychological symptoms and quality of life in people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library) (9 April 2020), MEDLINE Ovid SP (1946 to 9 April 2020), Embase Ovid SP (1972 to 9 April 2020), PsycINFO Ovid SP (1806 to 9 April 2020), CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1980 to 9 April 2020), LILACS via BIREME (all dates to 9 April 2020), ClinicalTrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov) (all dates to 9 April 2020), and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal (apps.who.int/trialsearch) (all dates to 9 April 2020). We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles to identify any additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, including cross-over studies, that evaluated the efficacy of SPT, consisting of personalised audio or videotape recordings of family members, in people with any form of dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. No meta-analyses were conducted because of substantial heterogeneity among the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials with 144 participants met the inclusion criteria. Two of the trials had a randomised cross-over design, one was a cross-over trial which we classified as quasi-randomised. Participants in the included studies were people with dementia living in nursing homes. They were predominantly women and had a mean age of over 80 years. SPT was performed using an audio or video recording prepared by family members or surrogates. It varied in its content, frequency of administration and duration. All the studies compared multiple treatments. In one study, SPT was compared with two other interventions; in the other two studies, it was compared with three other interventions. Specifically, SPT was compared to usual care, personalised music (two studies), a 'placebo' audiotape containing the voice of a person (two studies), and one-to-one social interaction performed by trained research assistants (one study). In terms of outcomes evaluated, one study considered agitation and withdrawn behaviour (both assessed with three methods); the second study evaluated verbal disruptive behaviour (assessed with three methods); and the third study evaluated physically agitated behaviour and verbally agitated behaviour (the method used was not clearly described). According to the GRADE criteria, the overall quality of the evidence was very low due to very small numbers of participants and risk of bias in the included studies; (none of the trials was at low risk of selection bias; all the trials were at high risk of performance bias; one trial was at high risk of attrition bias; and all had unclear selective reporting). Because of variation in the participants, the format of SPT, the comparison interventions, and the measures used to assess outcomes, we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. Within each trial, the effect of SPT on behaviour, compared to usual care, was mixed and depended on the measure used. Two trials which included a personalised music intervention reported no significant differences between simulated presence and music on behavioural outcomes. Because the overall quality of the evidence was very low, we were very uncertain regarding all the results None of the studies evaluated quality of life or any of our secondary outcome m asures (performance of activities of daily living, dropout and carer burden). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy of SPT for treating behavioural and psychological symptoms and improving quality of life of people with dementia. New high-quality studies are needed to investigate the effect of SPT.

AB  - Objectives This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesized the evidence on the impact of demographics and comorbidities with clinical outcomes of COVID-19, including severe illness, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and death. Methods The PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct and report this meta-analysis. The protocol is registered in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews (ID=CRD42020184440). Two authors independently searched literature from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and CINHAL on May 6, 2020; removed duplicates; screened titles, abstracts and full text using criteria; and extracted data from eligible articles. A random-effects model was used to estimate the summary odds ratio (OR). Variations among studies were examined using Cochrane Q and I2. Results Out of 4,275 articles obtained from the databases and screened, 71 studies that involved 216,843 patients were abstracted and then, where appropriate, analyzed by meta-analysis. The COVID-19 related outcomes reported were death in 26 studies, severe illness in 41 studies, and admission to ICU in 11 studies. Death was significantly correlated with hypertension (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.95,3.25; I2 = 52.6%; n= 13 studies), cardiovascular disease (5.16; 4.10,6.22; 0.0%; 6), diabetes (2.11; 1.35,2.87; 67.4%; 12), chronic respiratory disease (2.83; 2.14, 3.51; 0.0%; 9), cerebrovascular diseases (5.14; 1.08, 9.19; 0.0%; 2), male sex (1.34; 1.18, 1.50; 38.7%; 16), age older than 60 (6.09; 3.53, 8.66; 95.5%; 6) or 65 years (3.56; 1.21, 5.90; 18.2%, 6). Severe illness was also significantly associated with hypertension (1.70; 1.30, 2.10; 47.8%; 21), cardiovascular diseases (2.04; 1.01, 3.08; 30.6%, 10), diabetes (1.65; 1.23, 2.08; 24.9%; 18), male sex (1.35; 1.23, 1.47; 0.0%; 32) and age at least 60 (4.91; 1.35, 8.47; 0.0%; 4) or 65 (2.55; 1.94, 3.17; 24.5%; 9) years. Among hospitalized patients, the odds of admission to ICU was greater in individuals who had cardiovascular diseases (1.36; 1.04, 1.69; 0.0%; 4), diabetes (1.55; 1.20, 1.90; 0.0%; 5) and chronic respiratory disease (1.52; 1.09, 1.94; 0.0%; 5) than those who were not having these comorbidities. Conclusions Older age and chronic diseases increase the risk of developing severe illness, admission to ICU and death among COVID-19 patients. Special strategies are warranted to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and manage COVID-19 cases in those with vulnerabilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a major population health challenge globally. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to (i) determine depression prevalence and (ii) identify the risk and protective factors of depression among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). METHODS: The protocol was registered on Open Science Framework (registration ID: https://osf.io/rdv27 ). We searched five databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Al Manhal, Google Scholar) till July 22, 2020 without language restrictions. We included studies from the EMR using a depression screening or diagnostic instrument to measure the depression prevalence among HCWs. Studies were assessed and data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis based on the Cochrane handbook. RESULTS: The systematic review identified 108 studies from 12 EMR countries with varying quality. Working long hours, poor sleep quality and being female were risk factors for depression in EMR HCWs. The meta-analysis comprised 77 studies providing 122 prevalence measures across 7 EMR countries. The pooled prevalence of depression among EMR HCWs was 33.03% (95% CI = 27.40-39.19%). Emergency HCWs had markedly higher rates of depression [53.14% (95% CI = 26.63-77.99%)] compared to HCWs of other specialties. Most studies had an appropriate sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Depression among EMR HCWs is a major concern. Steps must be taken to prevent, identify, and manage depression among HCWs. Fostering a compassionate and empathetic environment is critically important to building a resilient healthcare system. Generating high-quality regional data from longitudinal studies on mental health will further contribute to a better understanding and management of depression among EMR HCWs.

AB  - Single brain enhancing lesions (SEL) are the most common presentation of neurocysticercosis (NCC) observed on neuroimaging in people presenting with epileptic seizures not only on the Indian sub-continent and in travelers returning from cysticercosis-endemic regions, but are also present in other parts of the world. The aim of this study, which consisted of a systematic review (CRD42019087665), a meta-analysis and an expert group consultation, was to reach consensus on the best anti-seizure medication and anti-inflammatory treatment for individuals with SEL NCC. Standard literature review methods were used. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used and random effects model meta-analyses were performed. The quality of the body of evidence was rated using GRADE tables. The expert committee included 12 gender and geographically balanced members and recommendations were reached by applying the GRADE framework for guideline development. The 1-1.5-year cumulative incidence of seizure recurrence, cyst resolution or calcification following anti-seizure medication (ASM) withdrawal was not statistically different between ASM of 6, 12 or 24 months. In contrast, in persons whose cyst calcified post treatment, longer ASM decreased seizure recurrence. The cumulative incidence ratio (CIR) 1-1.5 years after stopping ASM was 1.79 95% CI: (1.00, 3.20) for patients given 6 versus 24 months treatment. Anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids in patients treated with ASM compared to patients treated with ASM only showed a statistically significant beneficial effect on seizure reduction (CIR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23, 0.85) and cyst resolution (CIR 1.37, 95%CI: 1.07, 1.75). Our results indicate that ASM in patients with SEL NCC whose cysts resolved can be withdrawn, while patients whose cysts calcified seem to benefit from prolonged anti-seizure medication. Additional corticosteroid treatment was found to have a beneficial effect both on seizure reduction and cyst resolution.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: South Africa is a country known for its high levels of HIV infection and sexual violence. Although the interface between gender-based violence, HIV and mental health has been described, there are substantial gaps in knowledge of the medium-term and long-term health impact. The 2010 Global Burden of Disease study excluded many health outcomes associated with rape and other forms of gender-based violence because systematic reviews revealed huge gaps in data and poor evidence of health effects. This study aims to describe the incidence and attributable burden of physical and mental health problems (including HIV acquisition) in adult women over a 2-year postrape period, through comparison with a cohort of women who have not been raped. The study will substantially advance our understanding of the impact of rape and will generate robust data to assist in the development of postrape health services and the delivery of evidence-based care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This longitudinal study seeks to recruit 1008 rape-exposed and 1008 rape non-exposed women. Women were recruited from health services, and assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months. Outcome measures include exposure to risk factors; mental health status; cardio-metabolic risks; and biomarkers for HIV, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy and stress. The primary analysis will be to compare HIV incidence in the two groups using log-rank tests. Appropriate models to predict health outcomes over time will also be applied. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The South African Medical Research Council's Ethics Committee approved the study. As rape is a key element of the study, the safety and protection of participants guides the research process. We will adopt a research uptake strategy to ensure dissemination to policy makers, service providers and advocacy groups. Peer-reviewed journal articles will be published.

AB  - Severe fatigue occurs in one in four breast cancer survivors (BCS). Quality of life (QOL) and psychological factors are important in fatigue-oriented interventions for BCS, but an up-to-date overview is lacking. The aims of this review were to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of the relationship of fatigue with QOL and factors that can be addressed in psychological interventions for fatigue in BCS and (ii) determine the strength of evidence for these relationships. A systematic literature search was conducted to find studies on fatigue in BCS who had completed curative breast cancer treatment. Fatigue-related factors of 57 eligible studies were extracted and the level of evidence was determined. Factors regarding QOL (ie, general QOL, functioning, work ability, and mental health) had a negative relationship with fatigue (moderate to strong evidence). Target factors for psychological interventions were divided into the subcategories emotional problems, sleep disturbances, physical activity, pain, coping with cancer, dysfunctional cognitions, and social support. Moderate to strong evidence appeared for a relationship of fatigue with depressive symptoms, anxiety, distress, sleep disturbances, lower physical activity levels, pain, difficulties with coping with cancer, and catastrophizing about symptoms. These factors are points of attention for existing and future psychological interventions for fatigue in BCS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial interventions can reduce cancer-related fatigue effectively. However, it is still unclear if intervention effects differ across subgroups of patients. These meta-analyses aimed at evaluating moderator effects of (a) sociodemographic characteristics, (b) clinical characteristics, (c) baseline levels of fatigue and other symptoms, and (d) intervention-related characteristics on the effect of psychosocial interventions on cancer-related fatigue in patients with non-metastatic breast and prostate cancer. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Predicting OptimaL cAncer RehabIlitation and Supportive care (POLARIS) consortium. Potential moderators were studied with meta-analyses of pooled individual patient data from 14 randomized controlled trials through linear mixed-effects models with interaction tests. The analyses were conducted separately in patients with breast (n = 1091) and prostate cancer (n = 1008). RESULTS: Statistically significant, small overall effects of psychosocial interventions on fatigue were found (breast cancer: beta = -0.19 [95% confidence interval (95%CI) = -0.30; -0.08]; prostate cancer: beta = -0.11 [95%CI = -0.21; -0.00]). In both patient groups, intervention effects did not differ significantly by sociodemographic or clinical characteristics, nor by baseline levels of fatigue or pain. For intervention-related moderators (only tested among women with breast cancer), statistically significant larger effects were found for cognitive behavioral therapy as intervention strategy (beta = -0.27 [95%CI = -0.40; -0.15]), fatigue-specific interventions (beta = -0.48 [95%CI = -0.79; -0.18]), and interventions that only targeted patients with clinically relevant fatigue (beta = -0.85 [95%CI = -1.40; -0.30]). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings did not provide evidence that any selected demographic or clinical characteristic, or baseline levels of fatigue or pain, moderated effects of psychosocial interventions on fatigue. A specific focus on decreasing fatigue seems beneficial for patients with breast cancer with clinically relevant fatigue.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of surgical and nonsurgical treatment of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) luxation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic literature review searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases to identify randomized controlled trials on TMJ luxation treatment published between the inception of each database and 26 March 2018. RESULTS: Two authors assessed 113 unique abstracts according to the inclusion criteria and read nine articles in full text. Eight articles comprising 338 patients met the inclusion criteria, but none of these evaluated surgical techniques. Three studies including 185 patients concerned acute treatment with manual reduction of luxation while five studies including 153 patients evaluated minimally invasive methods with injection of autologous blood or dextrose prolotherapy for recurrent TMJ luxation. These studies reported that mouth opening after treatment was reduced and that independent of type of injection, recurrences of TMJ luxation were rare in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of randomized studies on surgical techniques, autologous blood injection in the superior joint space and pericapsular tissues with intermaxillary fixation seems to be the treatment for recurrent TMJ luxation that at present has the best scientific support. Well-designed studies on surgical techniques with sufficient numbers of patients, long-term follow-ups, and patient experience assessment are needed for selection of the optimal surgical treatment methods. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Autologous blood injection combined with intermaxillary fixation can be recommended for patients with recurrence of TMJ luxation.

AB  - PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. In-laboratory, overnight type I polysomnography (PSG) is the current "gold standard" for diagnosing OSA. Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) using portable monitors (PMs) is an alternative testing method offering better comfort and lower costs. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on diagnostic ability of type IV PMs compared to PSG in diagnosing OSA. METHODS: Participants: patients ≥16 years old with symptoms suggestive of OSA;intervention: type IV PMs (devices with < 2 respiratory channels); comparator: in-laboratory PSG; outcomes: diagnostic accuracy measures;studies: cross-sectional, prospective observational/experimental/quasi-experimental studies; information sources: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library from January 1, 2010 to May 10, 2016. All stages of review were conducted independently by two investigators. RESULTS: We screened 6054 abstracts and 117 full-text articles to select 24 full-text articles for final review. These 24 studies enrolled a total of 2068 patients with suspected OSA and evaluated 10 different PMs with one to six channels. Only seven (29%) studies tested PMs in the home setting. The mean difference (bias) between PSG-measured and PM-measured apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ranged from - 14.8 to 10.6 events/h. At AHI ≥ 5 events/h, the sensitivity of type IV PMs ranged from 67.5-100% and specificity ranged from 25 to 100%. CONCLUSION: While current evidence is not very strong for the stand-alone use of level IV PMs in clinical practice, they can potentially widen access to diagnosis and treatment of OSA. Policy recommendations regarding HSAT use should also consider the health and broader social implications of false positive and false negative diagnoses.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although many studies have examined the relationship between women's empowerment and a wide range of health outcomes, the extent to which the different dimensions of empowerment influence children's health, and through which mechanisms and in what contexts, is limited in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of this review is to systematically assess and examine studies that investigated the association between women's empowerment and children's health status in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A systematic review of the published literature is searched through PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus databases focusing on different measures of women's empowerment and children's health outcomes. Inclusion criteria in the review are studies that are published in English; full and original articles; studies measuring at least one dimension of women's empowerment and children's health outcomes; and Sub-Saharan African context. Studies included in this review are articles published between the year 2000 and 2019. Studies were excluded if the source was a letter, editorial, review, commentary, abstracts without providing full information about the study. RESULTS: Initially 4718 citations were identified. Finally, 15 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In general, the evidence suggests that women's empowerment at the household level is positively and statistically significantly associated with better children's health outcomes in sub-Saharan African countries. The review also reveals that women's decision-making power or autonomy is the most common measure of women's empowerment employed by many studies. CONCLUSIONS: Future related studies would benefit by incorporating additional aspects of women's empowerment and child health outcomes.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that cyberbullying has adverse physical and mental health consequences for youths. Unfortunately, most studies have focused on heterosexual and cisgender individuals. The scant available research on sexual minority and gender expansive youth (i.e., LGBTQ) shows that this group is at a higher risk for cyberbullying when compared to their heterosexual counterparts. However, to date no literature review has comprehensively explored the effects of cyberbullying on LGBTQ youth. A systematic review resulted in 27 empirical studies that explore the effects of cyberbullying on LGBTQ youth. Findings revealed that the percentage of cyberbullying among LGBTQ youth ranges between 10.5% and 71.3% across studies. Common negative effects of cyberbullying of LGBTQ youth include psychological and emotional (suicidal ideation and attempt, depression, lower self-esteem), behavioral (physical aggression, body image, isolation), and academic performance (lower GPAs). Recommendations and interventions for students, schools, and parents are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although rare, major urologic complications (MUC) in kidney transplantation can cause significant morbidity, increased cost, and may even lead to graft loss. Ureteric stents are routinely used to prevent MUC, although complications related to their use have been reported. Here, we systematically reviewed the role of routine stenting in preventing MUC in kidney transplantation with extravesical ureteric implantation and performed a meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed for studies on MUC and stents in kidney transplant recipients. Randomized controlled trials were shortlisted for the review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. RevMan 5 was used for statistical analysis, and outcome analysis was done with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test using random effect model. RESULTS: Six trials meeting the criteria were identified. Although stent use did not decrease the incidence of urinary leak (odds ratio [OR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.14-1.11; P = .08) or obstruction (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.13-1.24; P = .11), it was associated with a higher incidence of urinary tract infection (OR, 3.59; 95% CI, 1.33-9.75; P = .01). CONCLUSION: In the present era of extravesical ureterovesical anastomosis, routine stenting has a limited role in decreasing major urologic complications and may be associated with higher incidence of urinary tract infections.

AB  - AIMS: We performed a systematic review of clinical trials investigating the health benefits of physical activity in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: To perform this systematic review, search strategies were created and adapted to four databases. Only randomized controlled trials written in English before 1998 and that answered to the PICOS criteria were included. The PRISMA guidelines were followed to ensure highest scientific rigor within studies. RESULTS: Seven studies out of 2655 were included in this systematic review according to the inclusion criteria. These studies showed positive gains on global health: blood lipid profile, physical fitness, quality of life and body size and body composition but only one demonstrated a positive effect on glycemic control. CONCLUSION: Globally, physical activity exerts a positive impact on metabolic (i.e., decrease in total cholesterol, improvement of physical fitness, etc.) and psychological health in children with type 1 diabetes. Yet variations in study protocols or sample size restrict statistical power to reach the outcome of improving glycemic control in most studies. Here, we address the measured outcomes in individual trials and discuss potential key elements to consider for future clinical trials.

AB  - Cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is frequently used in the routine monitoring of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The potential benefit is based on the assumption that changes in serial concentrations may provide early and reliable information on tumor growth expediting an early and potentially effective treatment. However, it has remained a challenge to interpret increments in concentrations that correlate with increasing tumor burden in the individual patient. It has been hypothesized that CA125 assessment criteria taking the random variation (analytical and biological) into account may have better accuracy and lead-time potential than criteria based only on an arbitrary percentage of increase. The aims of the current PhD project were to i) identify different types of assessment criteria intended to interpret CA125 increments, ii) compare their ability to signal tumor growth, and iii) estimate the time interval between marker progression and clinical progression (lead-time). Study 1 was a systematic review of the literature identifying 21 relevant original articles reporting on 37 different assessment criteria to interpret serial CA125 concentrations. Study 2 was a preclinical phase I trial investigating the monitoring potential of seven selected criteria in a computer-based simulation model under standardized conditions. Study 3 was a clinical phase II trial comparing the performances of the seven criteria among 189 patients with EOC stage IC-IV during first-line chemotherapy and the subsequent follow-up period. Study 1 reported that the median sensitivity of the investigated criteria for recurrence was 57% (range 33%-95%) during primary therapy and 85% (range 62%-93%) during follow-up. The calculated false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) rates, respectively, were in median 1% (range 0%-13%) and 44% (range 5%-67%) during primary therapy and 9% (range 0%-33%) and 15% (range 7%-38%) during follow-up. Most of the reports were heterogeneous in terms of study design and format of presentation. Study 2 reported that for increments starting from baseline concentrations ≥cut-off, the best performing criterion in terms of low number of FP signals was based on a confirmed increment ≥2.5 times the nadir concentration. For increments starting from baseline concentrations ≤cut-off, the best performing criterion, also in terms of low number of FP signals, was based on a confirmed increment from ≤cut-off to >2 times the cut-off. Accordingly, the best performing criteria in terms of low number of FP events were based on an arbitrary required percentage of change without defining the random variation. Study 3 reported that the accuracy of the seven criteria observed during first-line chemotherapy and follow-up among all histological tumor types and serous tumors only was similar with overlapping 95% confidence intervals. The sensitivities for detecting CA125 increments ranged from 30% to 55%. The FP rates ranged from 0% to 17%; however, the FN rates ranged from 45% to 70%. The median lead-times ranged from 26 days to 87 days. The performances of the CA125 assessment criteria showed low sensitivities and low ability to exclude tumor growth. The chance of developing clinical progression following CA125 progression was high (range of positive predictive value 90%-100%); however, the lead-times were short among several patients. Thus, study 3 questioned the clinical utility of CA125 monitoring. Overall, the PhD study showed, that the different CA125 assessment criteria basically provided similar results thus rejecting the hypothesis that criteria based on calculating the random variation would outperform criteria based on a simple percentage of change. The simulated data proved useful for a preclinical evaluation of CA125 assessment criteria. The results suggested that regardless of the approach, fine-tuning of the assessment criteria did not seem to improve the monitoring performance of CA125 probably indicating that CA125 used as a tumor marker for monitoring has inherent limitations in terms of a curacy. Supplementary markers and alternative assessment criteria are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a very common, yet undiagnosed, breathing disorder that has many more implications besides disrupted sleep. Its role as an independent risk factor for metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance (IR) and impaired glucose tolerance is becoming increasingly recognized. The main treatment for OSAHS is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), however the impact of CPAP on IR and glucose metabolism is still debated. OBJECTIVES: Compile all available evidence regarding the effect of CPAP on IR in non-diabetic OSA patients. METHODS: A literature search in Medline, Epistemonikos and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register were searched through March 2018. We included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing CPAP treatment with sham CPAP, placebo or no treatment in non-diabetic adults with OSAHS. Risk of Bias was evaluated using Cochrane tool and a meta-analysis evaluating the efficacy of CPAP in both HOMA index and fasting glucose was done. Certain of evidence was rated using GRADE approach. RESULTS: Nine studies consisting of 443 participants were included. CPAP treatment significantly improved HOMA index (Mean difference = -0.39 Ui (CI, -0.69 to -0.08), p < 0.05. I2 = 57% (GRADE = LOW). However, CPAP showed no significant changes in fasting glucose (GRADE = LOW). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis shows evidence that metabolic disturbances could be halted and regressed with CPAP treatment in patients with insulin resistance and OSAHS. In conclusion, treatment with CPAP could improve HOMA IR index.

AB  - CONTEXT: The role of surgery in metastatic bladder cancer (BCa) is unclear. OBJECTIVE: In this collaborative review article, we reviewed the contemporary literature on the surgical management of metastatic BCa and factors associated with outcomes to support the development of clinical guidelines as well as informed clinical decision-making. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic search of English language literature using PubMed-Medline and Scopus from 1999 to 2016 was performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The beneficial role of consolidation surgery in metastatic BCa is still unproven. In patients with clinically evident lymph node metastasis, data suggest a survival advantage for patients undergoing postchemotherapy radical cystectomy with lymphadenectomy, especially in those with measurable response to chemotherapy (CHT). Intraoperatively identified enlarged pelvic lymph nodes should be removed. Anecdotal reports of resection of pulmonary metastasis as part of multimodal approach suggest possible improved survival in well-selected patients. Cytoreductive radical cystectomy as local treatment has also been explored in patients with metastatic disease, although its benefits remain to be assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Consolidative extirpative surgery may be considered in patients with clinically evident pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodal metastases but only if they have had a response to CHT. Surgery for limited pulmonary metastases may also be considered in very selected cases. Best candidates are those with resectable disease who demonstrate measurable response to CHT with good performance status. In the absence of data from prospective randomized studies, each patient should be evaluated on an individual basis and decisions made together with the patient and multidisciplinary teams. PATIENT SUMMARY: Surgical resection of metastases is technically feasible and can be safely performed. It may help improve cancer control and eventually survival in very selected patients with limited metastatic burden. In a patient who is motivated to receive chemotherapy and to undergo extirpative surgical intervention, surgery should be discussed with the patient among other consolidation therapies in the setting of multidisciplinary teams.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize research findings on the associations between acceptance, quality of life (QOL), and mental health outcomes in individuals living with spinal cord injury (SCI). METHODS: Five databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched. Studies were included if they provided findings on the association between acceptance and QOL, mental health outcomes, or both in an SCI population aged 16 years or older. Only peer-reviewed original quantitative and qualitative studies were included. Screening, quality assessment, and data extraction were conducted independently by two researchers. Findings were tabulated and synthesized by outcome. RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included. Greater acceptance was consistently associated with greater global and psychological QOL, life satisfaction, sense of well-being, mental health, and with lower levels of depression and anxiety. Inconsistent evidence was found with regards to social QOL and post-traumatic stress disorder. Acceptance was generally not associated with adjustment outcomes further than 2 years into the future. Study quality of the quantitative studies was mostly fair (n = 17) followed by good (n = 13), and poor (n = 9). CONCLUSION: Health-care professionals may regard acceptance as a psychological resource they can aim to support in improving QOL and mental health following SCI. A range of methodological and conceptual limitations were present in the research. Future studies should prioritize longitudinal designs, consider dyadic effects, explore subjective meaning(s) of acceptance, and investigate the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches that stimulate the acceptance process.

AB  - - Background Many people with schizophrenia do not achieve satisfactory improvements in their mental state, particularly the symptom of hearing voices (hallucinations), with medical treatment. Objectives To examine the effects of Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Search methods In December 2016, November 2018 and April 2019, the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study‐Based Register of Trials (including registries of clinical trials) was searched, review authors checked references of all identified relevant reports to identify more studies and contacted authors of trials for additional information. Selection criteria All randomised clinical trials focusing on Avatar Therapy for people with schizophrenia or related disorders. Data collection and analysis We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), on an intention‐to‐treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and 95% CIs. We employed a fixed‐effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE. Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important change in; mental state, insight, global state, quality of life and functioning as well as adverse effects and leaving the study early. Main results We found 14 potentially relevant references for three studies (participants = 195) comparing Avatar Therapy with two other interventions; treatment as usual or supportive counselling. Both Avatar Therapy and supportive counselling were given in addition (add‐on) to the participants' normal care. All of the studies had high risk of bias across one or more domains for methodology and, for other risks of bias, authors from one of the studies were involved in the development of the avatar systems on trial and in another trial, authors had patents on the avatar system pending. 1. Avatar Therapy compared with treatment as usual When Avatar Therapy was compared with treatment as usual average endpoint Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale – Positive (PANSS‐P) scores were not different between treatment groups (MD –1.93, 95% CI –5.10 to 1.24; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). A measure of insight (Revised Beliefs about Voices Questionnaire; BAVQ‐R) showed an effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD –5.97, 95% CI –10.98 to –0.96; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low‐certainty evidence). No one was rehospitalised in either group in the short term (risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI –0.20 to 0.20; studies = 1, participants = 19; low‐certainty evidence). Numbers leaving the study early from each group were not clearly different – although more did leave from the Avatar Therapy group (6/14 versus 0/12; RR 11.27, 95% CI 0.70 to 181.41; studies = 1, participants = 26; low‐certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in anxiety between treatment groups (RR 5.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 89.80; studies = 1, participants = 19; low‐certainty evidence). For quality of life, average Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire‐Short Form (QLESQ‐SF) scores favoured Avatar Therapy (MD 9.99, 95% CI 3.89 to 16.09; studies = 1, participants = 19; very low‐certainty evidence ) . No study reported data for functioning. 2. Avatar Therapy compared with supportive counselling When Avatar Therapy was compared with supportive counselling (all short‐term), general mental state (Psychotic Symptom Rating Scale (PSYRATS)) scores favoured the Avatar Therapy group (MD –4.74, 95% CI –8.01 to –1.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low‐certainty evidence). For insight (BAVQ‐R), there was a small effect in favour of Avatar Therapy (MD –8.39, 95% CI –14.31 to –2.47; studies = 1, participants = 124; low‐certainty evidence). Around 20% of each group left the study early (risk ratio (RR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.89; studies = 1, participants = 150; moderate‐certainty evidence). Analysis of qua ity of life scores (Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA)) showed no clear difference between groups (MD 2.69, 95% CI –1.48 to 6.86; studies = 1, participants = 120; low‐certainty evidence). No data were available for rehospitalisation rates, adverse events or functioning. Authors' conclusions Our analyses of available data shows few, if any, consistent effects of Avatar Therapy for people living with schizophrenia who experience auditory hallucinations. Where there are effects, or suggestions of effects, we are uncertain because of their risk of bias and their unclear clinical meaning. The theory behind Avatar Therapy is compelling but the practice needs testing in large, long, well‐designed, well‐reported randomised trials undertaken with help from – but not under the direction of – Avatar Therapy pioneers. Plain language summary Avatar Therapy for schizophrenia or related disorders Review question Is Avatar Therapy an effective add‐on treatment for people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder? Background Auditory hallucination is perceiving voices when there is no external stimulus. Around 70% of people with schizophrenia experience these. Medication may help cause these to decrease or disappear. However, some people do not want to take medication and, in a proportion of people, it has little meaningful effect. Avatar Therapy is an experimental technology that uses a visualised avatar face, voice and other sensory input to create an interactive computerised environment. We investigated the effects of Avatar Therapy for improving auditory hallucinations for people with schizophrenia. Searches Cochrane Schizophrenia's Information Specialist searched through the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's database for randomised trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) of people with schizophrenia receiving either Avatar Therapy or treatment as usual. We found 14 reports from four studies. The evidence is current to April 2020. Trials Four studies met our inclusion criteria, three of which provided useable data and one is still underway. The reliability of the evidence for the three included studies was very low to low . All data were limited to six weeks' treatment and one week' follow‐up and, in some cases, data were not usable (we contacted the authors). All the reported data are just for the short‐term period of trials and it is apparent that we need more studies with medium‐ to long‐term periods to be able to estimate the rate of Avatar Therapy's effectiveness. Conclusions Three short‐term studies with 195 participants were included in this review. Avatar Therapy was compared with treatment as usual and supportive counselling. Evidence from the trials was not high quality. Although there were some suggestions of positive effects, because of the unclear meaning for front‐line care, and the considerable risk of bias of each of the results, we cannot be certain of these effects. There is just as great a risk of Avatar Therapy causing problems to people. More trials are needed, and those undertaking them should collaborate, work with all involved to choose outcomes that mean something in daily life, and design studies that will provide clear information across months to years for anyone who is interested.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS) is a safe and well-tolerated intervention. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is used for the treatment of depression and for the treatment and prevention of migraine. Over the last few years, several reports and randomised controlled studies of the use of rMS for the treatment of pain have been published. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the available literature regarding the use of rMS in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. METHODS: After a systematic Medline search we identified 12 papers eligible to be included in this review. RESULTS: The majority of the studies were on patients with phantom limb pain, followed by radiculopathy, plexopathy, post-traumatic pain and peripheral neuropathy. The treatment protocols vary significantly from study to study and, therefore, pooling the results together is currently difficult. However, rMS has a definite immediate effect in pain relief which, in the majority of studies, is maintained for a few weeks. CONCLUSION: rMS seems to be a promising intervention in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. Further research is in the field is needed. Use of neuronavigation might increase the precision of stimulation and subsequently its effectiveness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment by adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common issue. Strategies delivered by means of information and communication technologies (ie, eHealth) can address treatment adherence through patient education, real-time monitoring of apnea symptoms and CPAP adherence in daily life, self-management, and early identification and subsequent intervention when device or treatment problems arise. However, the effectiveness of available eHealth technologies in improving CPAP adherence has not yet been systematically studied. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analytic review was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a broad range of eHealth interventions in improving CPAP treatment adherence. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of the databases of Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase to identify relevant randomized controlled trials in adult OSA populations. The risk of bias in included studies was examined using seven items of the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias tool. The meta-analysis was conducted with comprehensive meta-analysis software that computed differences in mean postintervention adherence (MD), which was defined as the average number of nightly hours of CPAP use. RESULTS: The meta-analysis ultimately included 18 studies (N=5429 adults with OSA) comprising 22 comparisons between experimental and control conditions. Postintervention data were assessed at 1 to 6 months after baseline, depending on the length of the experimental intervention. eHealth interventions increased the average nightly use of CPAP in hours as compared with care as usual (MD=0.54, 95% CI 0.29-0.79). Subgroup analyses did not reveal significant differences in effects between studies that used eHealth as an add-on or as a replacement to care as usual (P=.95), between studies that assessed stand-alone eHealth and blended strategies combining eHealth with face-to-face care (P=.23), or between studies of fully automated interventions and guided eHealth interventions (P=.83). Evidence for the long-term follow-up effectiveness of eHealth adherence interventions remains undecided owing to a scarcity of available studies and their mixed results. CONCLUSIONS: eHealth interventions for adults with OSA can improve adherence to CPAP in the initial months after the start of treatment, increasing the mean nightly duration of use by about half an hour. Uncertainty still exists regarding the timing, duration, intensity, and specific types of eHealth interventions that could be most effectively implemented by health care providers.

AB  - - Background Most vaginal births are associated with trauma to the genital tract. The morbidity associated with perineal trauma can be significant, especially when it comes to third‐ and fourth‐degree tears. Different interventions including perineal massage, warm or cold compresses, and perineal management techniques have been used to prevent trauma. This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2011. Objectives To assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence and morbidity associated with perineal trauma. Search methods We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (26 September 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Published and unpublished randomised and quasi‐randomised controlled trials evaluating perineal techniques during the second stage of labour. Cross‐over trials were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality. We checked data for accuracy. Main results Twenty‐two trials were eligible for inclusion (with 20 trials involving 15,181 women providing data). Trials were at moderate to high risk of bias; none had adequate blinding, and most were unclear for both allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. Interventions compared included the use of perineal massage, warm and cold compresses, and other perineal management techniques. Most studies did not report data on our secondary outcomes. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision for all comparisons. Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on Hands on or hands off the perineum made no clear difference in incidence of intact perineum (average risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.12, two studies, Tau² 0.00, I² 37%, 6547 women; moderate‐quality evidence) , first‐degree perineal tears (average RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.77, two studies, 700 women; low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.28, two studies, 700 women; low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (average RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.21 to 2.26, five studies, Tau² 0.92, I² 72%, 7317 women; very low‐quality evidence). Substantial heterogeneity for third‐ or fourth‐degree tears means these data should be interpreted with caution. Episiotomy was more frequent in the hands‐on group (average RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, Tau² 0.07, I² 74%, four studies, 7247 women; low‐quality evidence), but there was considerable heterogeneity between the four included studies. There were no data for perineal trauma requiring suturing. Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress) A warm compress did not have any clear effect on the incidence of intact perineum (average RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.21; 1799 women; four studies; moderate‐quality evidence), perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.66; 76 women; one study; very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (average RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.56; 274 women; two studies; very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomy (average RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.23; 1799 women; four studies; low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compress increases or reduces the incidence of first‐degree tears (average RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.38 to 3.79; 274 women; two studies; I² 88%; very low‐quality evidence). Fewer third‐ or fourth‐degree perineal tears were reported in the warm‐compress group (average RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.79; 1799 women; four studies; moderate‐quality evidence ) . Massage versus control (hands off or routine care) The incidence of intact perineum was increased in the perineal‐massage group (average RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73, six studies, 2618 women; I² 83% low‐quality evidence) but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. This group experienced fewer third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (av rage RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.94, five studies, 2477 women; moderate‐quality evidence). There were no clear differences between groups for perineal trauma requiring suturing (average RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.61, one study, 76 women; very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (average RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.79 to 3.05, five studies, Tau² 0.47, I² 85%, 537 women; very low‐quality evidence), or second‐degree tears (average RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.12, five studies, Tau² 0.32, I² 62%, 537 women; very low‐quality evidence). Perineal massage may reduce episiotomy although there was considerable uncertainty around the effect estimate (average RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.03, seven studies, Tau² 0.43, I² 92%, 2684 women; very low‐quality evidence). Heterogeneity was high for first‐degree tear, second‐degree tear and for episiotomy ‐ data should be interpreted with caution. Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care One study (66 women) found that women receiving Ritgen's manoeuvre were less likely to have a first‐degree tear (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69; very low‐quality evidence), more likely to have a second‐degree tear (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.73 to 6.09; very low‐quality evidence), and neither more nor less likely to have an intact perineum (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31; very low‐quality evidence). One larger study reported that Ritgen's manoeuvre did not have an effect on incidence of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.96,1423 women; low‐quality evidence). Episiotomy was not clearly different between groups (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.03, two studies, 1489 women; low‐quality evidence). Other comparisons Delivery of posterior versus anterior shoulder first, use of a perineal protection device, different oils/wax, and cold compresses did not show any effects on outcomes with the exception of increased incidence of intact perineum with the perineal device. Only one study contributed to each of these comparisons. Authors' conclusions Moderate‐quality evidence suggests that warm compresses, and massage, may reduce third‐ and fourth‐degree tears but the impact of these techniques on other outcomes was unclear or inconsistent. Poor‐quality evidence suggests hands‐off techniques may reduce episiotomy, but this technique had no clear impact on other outcomes. There were insufficient data to show whether other perineal techniques result in improved outcomes. Further research could be performed evaluating perineal techniques, warm compresses and massage, and how different types of oil used during massage affect women and babies. It is important for any future research to collect information on women's views. Plain language summary Perineal techniques during the second stage of labour for reducing perineal trauma What is the issue? Vaginal births are often associated with some form of trauma to the genital tract, and tears that affect the anal sphincter or mucosa (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears) can cause serious problems. Perineal trauma can occur spontaneously or result from a surgical incision (episiotomy). Different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head, and allow the perineum to stretch slowly to prevent injury. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. The objective of this updated review was to assess the effect of perineal techniques during the second stage of labour on the incidence of perineal trauma. This is an update of a review that was published in 2011. Why is this important? Trauma to the perineum can cause pain and other problems for women after the birth. The damage is described as first‐, second‐, third‐ and fourth‐degree tears – first‐degree tears being the least damage and fourth‐degree tears being the most. Third‐ and fourth‐degree tears, affect the anal sphincter or mucosa, thus causing the most problems. Reducing the use of episiotomies will reduce trauma to the perineum. Also, different perineal techniques are being used to slow down the birth of the baby's head. Massage, warm compresses and different perineal management techniques are widely used by midwives and birth attendants. It is important to know if these do indeed reduce trauma and pain for women. What evidence did we find? We searched for studies in September 2016. Twenty two trials were eligible for inclusion in this updated review but only twenty studies (involving 15,181 women), contributed results to the review. The participants in the studies were women without medical complications who were expecting a vaginal birth. The studies varied in their risk of bias, and the quality of the studies was very low to moderate. Hands off (or poised) compared to hands on Using 'hands off' the perineum resulted in fewer women having an episiotomy (low‐quality evidence), but made no difference to numbers of women with no tears (moderate‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (low‐quality evidence), or third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There were considerable unexplained differences in results between the four studies. None of the studies provided data on the number of tears requiring suturing. Warm compresses versus control (hands off or no warm compress) Fewer women in the warm‐compress group experienced third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). A warm compress did not affect numbers of women with intact perineum (moderate‐quality evidence), tears requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (low‐quality evidence). It is uncertain whether warm compresses increase or reduce the incidence of first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). Massage versus control (hands off or routine care) There were more women with an intact perineum in the perineal massage group (low‐quality evidence), and fewer women with third‐ or fourth‐degree tears (moderate‐quality evidence). Massage did not appear to make a difference to women with perineal trauma requiring suturing (very low‐quality evidence), first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), or episiotomies (very low‐quality evidence). Ritgen's manoeuvre versus standard care One small study found that women who had Ritgen's manoeuvre had fewer first‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence), but more second‐degree tears (very low‐quality evidence). There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of third‐ or fourth‐degree tears, or episiotomies (both low‐quality evidence). What does this mean? We found that massage and warm compresses may reduce serious perineal trauma (third‐ and fourth‐degree tears). Hands‐off techniques may reduce the number of episiotomies but it was not clear that these techniques had a beneficial effect on other perineal trauma. There remains uncertainty about the value of other techniques to reduce damage to the perineum during childbirth. More research is necessary, to evaluate different perineal techniques and to answer questions about how to minimise perineal trauma. There is insufficient evidence on women's experiences and views (only one included study collected information on this). It is important for future research to ascertain whether these interventions are acceptable to women.

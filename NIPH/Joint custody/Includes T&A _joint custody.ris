AB  - We live in a fluid and mobile world, where rapid changes in our lives may suddenly occur. This is the case also for many people living in families. Family breakups are rather commonplace these days, being events usually representing major implications for all the family members affected by the changed living conditions, most often also meaning a change of residence, homestead and place. Such implications are particularly visible with the children affected by the breakups, whose lives now either have to be shared with only one parent, or to be shared between the two parents. In Norway the most common childcare arrangement after a divorce is that one of the parents gets the primary care responsibility, most commonly the mother. In a survey from 2004 about responsibility and care after the child support reform (Bidragsreformen) of 2003, Kitterød found that mothers got custody in 82 percent of all cases, fathers 8 percent, and 10 percent share custody for their children. This assignment is concerned about the last group those who share custody for their children, also known as joint custody, (delt bosted). This arrangement is a relatively new and not a very widespread one, but we can see a growing tendency towards following this new trend. Joint custody is, however, a controversial arrangement, having led to many debates around its implications for the children and whether or not this arrangement is to their best interests. The arrangement implies that children spend an equal amount of time with both their parents, even though those no longer live together. Joint custody may be arranged in different ways, but most frequently the child live part time in each of his/hers parents` homes, normally one week at each place (Skjørten, 2007) Thus these children have two places to call their home, and their parents live every other week without their children in their separate homes. Is this a bad way for children to grow up, a restless and unsecure form of dwelling, critics might ask? Or is it a right step towards making children useful adults fit for an increasingly mobile and changing world? In my study I draw on my own experience, having a son living in joint custody for about seven years. Thus the background for my thesis is a curiosity about what this might mean for him and for his conception and personal relation to the notion of home. It is also based on how I myself experience my home, and my relation to home changing according to his presence or absence. What exactly is home, why do some places become homes, and can we relate home to several places? Accordingly, the aim of this thesis is to study the particular family arrangement called joint custody, trying to get an understanding of how this is organized, and its impacts on both the parents` and the children’s experience of the place called home. Using geographical knowledge and theory about the concepts of place and home, I seek to illuminate questions related to these concepts. This is being done through the experiences of eight informants, two fathers and six mothers of children living in joint custody. The research was conducted by the author in the autumn 2008 in Trondheim, Norway, and applied through qualitative depth interviews. Home certainly is a complex term which has been used in many different ways throughout time. Home is here understood as a place, which on its own is an important and a rather complex concept in geography. Both these concepts are outlined and discussed in chapter 3. I especially draw on Doreen Massey (1994, 2005) and her understanding of places as meeting places. This relational approach is also a key element in the critical geography of home formulated by Blunt and Dowling in their book Home (2006).

AB  - Self-regulation, or the ability to effectively manage emotions and behavior, is a critical skill to develop in early childhood. Children living in a context of economic hardship are at an increased risk for developing self-regulation difficulties. However, few studies have comprehensively examined how multiple aspects of the caregiving environment, including fathers' parenting and coparenting quality, may contribute to child self-regulation. Thus, this study applied a family systems perspective to examine whether coparenting and resident and non-resident fathers' reports of parenting quantity and quality were associated with observations of children's self-regulation. Participants were drawn from the Embedded Developmental Study (n = 257) of the Three-City Study, a longitudinal study of children and families facing economic hardship. At Wave 1, when children were 2-4 years old, reports of parenting (i.e., quantity and quality) and coparenting (i.e., support) were obtained. At Wave 2, when children were 3-6 years old, children participated in a snack delay and gift wrap task, which assessed their self-regulation. Multi-group path analyses indicated that resident fathers' harsh parenting at Wave 1 predicted decreased levels of self-regulation at Wave 2. Non-resident fathers' reported hours of involvement at Wave 1 predicted greater levels of self-regulation at Wave 2. Additionally, supportive coparenting among families with a non-resident father predicted greater self-regulation. Supportive coparenting was not associated with child self-regulation in families with a resident father. The implications for research focused on facilitating positive father-child relationships in diverse family contexts are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the qualities that contribute to postdivorce child attachment in a sample of 24 divorcing mothers and their children, ages 12 to 73 months, in the context of shared parenting time arrangements. Child attachment was assessed using Waters's Attachment Q-Set (AQS). Qualities such as age at onset of overnight stays, interparental conflict and communication, and emotional availability were examined for their importance in attachment security and dependency. Study hypotheses were partially supported. Although the study variables collectively did not predict attachment security and dependency outcomes, as hypothesized, the predictor variable of emotional availability (EA) child involvement proved significantly related with AQS security. Children who involved their mothers more in interaction were more secure with them. Further, EA child involvement contributed to attachment outcomes above and beyond age of onset of overnight stays and parent and partner contributions to interparental conflict.

AB  - BackgroundJoint physical custody is a parental care arrangement in which children live roughly an equal amount of time with each parent after family dissolution, residing alternately in each of the two parental households. Because joint physical custody is characterised by fathers' continued involvement in their children's lives, this care arrangement is believed to compensate for the negative effects of family dissolution, and to contribute to children's well-being in post-separation families.ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate potential differences in the experiences of stress of children living in joint physical custody and sole physical custody arrangements, while considering both the proportion of time the children spend with each of their parents and the number of transitions the children make between the parental households.MethodsBased on data from the Family Models in Germany (FAMOD) study, a national convenience sample, linear regression models were estimated for 297 children between the ages of 11 and 14.ResultsThe statistical analysis suggests that there was no significant association between the physical custody type (sole physical custody vs. joint physical custody) and the children's levels of stress. In addition, the results revealed that children's experiences of stress did not depend on how often they moved between their parents' households.ConclusionsThis study does not corroborate the assumption that joint physical custody has a protective effect on children, but instead suggests that different physical custody arrangements are associated with different stressors that lead to similar levels of stress in children living in different post-separation families.

AB  - Aim: The prevalence of psychosomatic complaints among children and adolescents appears to be increasing. At the same time, the numbers of joint physical custody families are rising across Western countries. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between post-separation care arrangements (joint physical custody vs. sole physical custody) and children's risks of psychosomatic problems, while considering the potential mediating role of parent-child relationships. Subject and methods: Based on data from the Family Models in Germany (FAMOD) study, stepwise linear regression models and seemingly unrelated regression models were estimated for a sample of 473 children aged seven to 14 living in either sole physical custody or joint physical custody families. Result(s): Children in joint physical custody families reported significantly fewer psychosomatic problems than children in sole physical custody families. Furthermore, living in a joint physical custody arrangement was associated with better parent-child relationships, although only the mother-child relationship was significantly related to children's psychosomatic complaints, and partially mediated the association between physical custody arrangements and children's psychosomatic complaints. No corresponding association could be found with respect to the father-child relationship. Conclusion(s): The risk of psychosomatic problems was distributed unequally among post-separation families, as children living in joint physical custody arrangements suffered from fewer psychosomatic problems than children living in sole physical custody arrangements. Because part of this association was explained by the quality of the mother-child relationship, children's relationships with other family members appear to be important factors to consider when seeking to promote children's health in post-separation care arrangements.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated the relationship between joint physical custody and children's mental health, and tested whether interparental conflict moderated the association. Background: Joint physical custody is an emerging post-separation care arrangement that is expected to counter the negative effects of family dissolution on children's overall wellbeing. There is, however, substantial disagreement about the impact that joint physical custody may have on children's mental health when interparental conflict is high. Method: The statistical analysis was based on data from the Family Models in Germany (FAMOD) study, which was conducted in 2019. The analytical sample consisted of 1,087 post-separation families practicing either sole physical custody or joint physical custody. Linear regression models were estimated to determine the relationship between physical custody arrangements, interparental conflict, and children's mental health problems. Results: Living in a joint physical custody arrangement was positively related to children's mental health, whereas high levels of interparental conflict were negatively related to children's mental health. However, when levels of interparental conflict were high children in joint physical custody arrangements displayed levels of mental health problems that were quite similar to those of children in sole physical custody arrangements. Conclusion: The findings emphasize that joint physical custody is not a "one-size-fits-all model" that is suitable for all post-separation families, and that it is only beneficial for children's mental health when interparental conflict is low.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between externalizing behaviors and the quality of attachment representations in preschool children, and to determine if family type and custody arrangement had a moderating effect on this relationship. The participants were 33 girls and 31 boys (n = 64) aged between three and six years (M = 4.75; SD = 0.87 years) and their mothers. Among them, 36 came from "intact" families, 13 were living mainly with their mothers and 15 were in joint physical custody. Children's attachment representations were assessed with the Attachment Story Completion Task (Bretherton, Ridgeway & Cassidy, 1990). Mothers reported on their child's behavior problems using the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) and on their alliance with the father using the Parenting Alliance Inventory (Abidin & Brunner, 1995). Although children's externalizing behaviors were found to be associated with the disorganization of their attachment representations, this relationship was significantly weaker and was non-significant for children in joint physical custody. Thus, the results of this pilot study suggest that joint custody may protect children of separated parents from the effects of attachment disorganization on externalizing behaviors.

AB  - Besides the traditional post-separation residential arrangement in which the children live with the mother and have regular contact with the father, new arrangements have emerged and become more widespread in which parents strive for a more equal division of tasks. We used an explanatory mixed methods research design to enhance insight into the life course characteristics of separated parents involved in shared residence arrangements. Survey data derived from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) and Divorce in the Netherlands 1998 were supplemented with information from in-depth interviews with NKPS respondents. We found that shared residence parents seem to be a typical modern category of separated parents with a specific set of characteristics. The distance between the residences of the ex-partners plays a crucial role in maintaining a shared residence arrangement. Highly educated, dual-career ex-couples, and those with high incomes are also more likely to be involved in a shared residence arrangement. Shared residence arrangements were more likely when the woman had a new partner, but less likely when the man had a new partner. Our findings on gender differences are in line with the idea that involvement in non-traditional residential arrangements is a sign of increased paternal involvement, but decreased maternal involvement, compared with the traditional arrangements.

AB  - Research suggests that high parental support and control improves children's well-being. However, a large part of these studies have focused on the parenting of married parents. Research on parenting after a divorce, mainly has focused on parenting of divorced mothers, with few exceptions concentrating primarily on non-residential fathers. Therefore, we compared both parenting dimensions support and control of fathers in different family structures (non-residential fathers, fathers in joint custody and married fathers). We also investigated the association between fathers' parenting dimensions and children's self-esteem, controlled for the parenting dimensions of the mother. Data from 587 children (50 % girls) between 10 and 18 years old and their parents were examined. Results revealed that non-residential fathers (n = 225) were less supportive and controlling than fathers in joint custody (n = 138) and married fathers (n = 224). Nevertheless, having a supportive father was beneficial to children's self-esteem in each family structure. We conclude that, even after a divorce, fathers have the capacity to enhance children's self-esteem and we suggest that future research should investigate this capacity.

AB  - Previous research has indicated that authoritative parenting is positively related to children's well-being. This research has, however, primarily focused on parenting of married parents or divorced mothers. This article contributes to the literature by investigating parenting styles of divorced fathers in different custodial arrangements and their influence on children's well-being. Based on a subsample (N = 684) of the multi-actor dataset 'Divorce in Flanders', in which married as well as divorced parents and children are included, we first compare parenting styles of residential fathers, fathers in joint custody and non-residential fathers. Second, the relationship between parenting styles of divorced fathers and children's self-esteem and satisfaction with life is examined. Third, we investigate if this relationship differs according to custodial arrangements. Results indicate that non-residential fathers are more permissive and uninvolved. Still, authoritative fathers in different custodial arrangements can have a positive influence on children's self-esteem and satisfaction with life. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This study is embedded within a recent theoretical shift emphasising the importance of fathers as equal co-parents. Nevertheless, research examining whether fathers and mothers are equally important to the well-being of children remains underdeveloped. For this reason, we investigate first whether the impact of maternal and paternal parenting is equally important to the well-being of children after divorce. Second, we examine whether maternal and paternal parenting is equally important for children's well-being in different custodial arrangements. Using constraint-moderated structural equation models, we analyse a subsample of the 'Divorce in Flanders' dataset, which contains information on 363 children and their divorced parents. Results reveal that the impact of maternal and paternal parenting is equally important to the well-being of children. This remains the same for both children in joint custody and in families with non-residential fathers. Parental support has a particularly strong effect in improving the well-being of children. The parenting of divorced fathers is therefore just as important to the well-being of children as is the parenting of divorced mothers.

AB  - Divorce and its subsequent transitions can be stressful for children and therefore, affect their well-being in a negative manner. Effective parenting (with high support and high control) can, however, function as a protective factor. While previous studies have indicated that effective parenting does indeed improve children's well-being after divorce, these studies tended to concentrate on maternal family structures and transitions as well as maternal parenting. With this study, we investigate the mediating role of both maternal and paternal parenting between various family structures after divorce (including the custodial arrangement as well as the repartnering of both parents) and children's well-being. Therefore, we analyzed 618 parent-child dyads from the multi-actor dataset "Divorce in Flanders-DiF" using a mediated structural equation model. Results revealed that both maternal and paternal parenting can mediate between family structure after divorce and children's well-being. Depending on the type of post divorce family constellation, parenting can be considered as a risk or a protective factor, for both maternal and paternal parenting.

AB  - When thinking about custodial arrangements after a divorce, there has been a shift from sole custody (mainly by mothers) to joint physical custody after a divorce. In certain countries, joint physical custody has even become the primary, legal custodial arrangement. Joint physical custody, whether implemented in legislation or not, is believed to be in the best interests of the child, as children can shape a postdivorce relationship with both their mother and father. Nevertheless, many studies on joint physical custody focus only on child outcomes. This study aims to investigate (1) whether custodial arrangements matter in addition to the parental divorce for parent-child relationships and (2) whether joint physical custody provides a better framework for parent-child relationships than sole custody arrangements. The study adds to the existing literature by including both the mother-child relationship and the father-child relationship. Moreover, joint physical custody is not only compared to sole maternal custody, but also to sole paternal custody. Using a dyadic subsample of Belgian parents and children from the Divorce in Flanders data set (N = 623), we compare two indicators of the parent-child relationship (parent-child communication and parenting) for children with married parents, with children in joint physical custody, sole maternal custody, and sole paternal custody. The results indicate that (1) the custodial arrangements after divorce affect parent-child relationships, in addition to the divorce, with regard to both open and problematic father-child communications and the support and control of children by mothers and fathers; and (2) joint physical custody, compared with sole custody (either by the mother or father), provides a better framework to shape a postdivorce parent-child relationship with both parents in terms of open communications and support.

AB  - This article considers the experience and feelings of children in a context of alternating residence in joint custody. Semi-directive interviews conducted within the scope of an exploratory study highlight two forms of parenting schedule to which this formula leads: relational alternation that assumes both continuity in relations and recurrent separations with both parents, and spatial alternation implying transfers between residences. While global satisfaction associated with such alternation processes generally emerges from what they have to say, the nature of the co-parental relationship represents a decisive factor. This study shows the advantage of adopting a systemic approach, taking the family context into account and analysing the rearrangements that take place in family relations following marital separation and the implementation of shared residence.

AB  - Aim of study: This study is based on an exploratory and an ecosystemic theoretical approach (Bronfenbrenner, 2005). This research aims to understand how children in situation of joint physical custody evolve in terms of socioemotional adaptation and to analyze the contribution of individual (children's age and sex), family (parental alliance, income, current marital status of the parents, sibling) and temporal (time elapsed since separation and children age at the beginning of the joint physical custody) factors. Population and methods: Thirteen mothers and 13 fathers of 38 children aged 4 to 12 years completed questionnaires. The socioemotional adjustment of children was examined through the Child Behavior Checklist 4/18 (Achenbach, 1991) and the parenting alliance was assessed with the Parenting Alliance Inventory (Abidin and Brunner, 1995). Results: Among 38 children, 16% figure in the limit or pathological zone on the internalized adaptation, and 10% figure in the same zones assessed by the externalized adaptation scale. Among the factors taken into consideration, we note first, that there is a significant effect of children age: children between 4 to 5 years tend to show less personal internalizing problems than children between 6 to 12 years. Secondly, results reveal that the parent alliance influences only the anxiety/depressive symptoms. Finally, we show the influence of children age at the beginning of joint physical custody on their socioemotional adjustment. Children 4 to 5 years old have more internalizing problems than those aged 1 to 3 years old. However, results indicate that time elapsed since separation moderates the effect of this variable on externalized adaptation. Indeed, children in joint physical custody since the age of 1 to 3 years who have experienced parental separation more than 2 years ago have more externalizing problems than those who experienced this separation 2 years ago or less.

AB  - A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the adjustment of children in joint and sole custody. The studies included here defined joint custody as a proportion of time spent by children in each home ranging from a one-third time division (70%/30%) to an equal share (50%/50%). The overall results of the 19 selected studies revealed better outcomes for children in joint custody, with a weak effect size (d = .109). Moreover, this association was moderated by the amount of time that children spent with their 2 parents. Other moderation analyses conducted on the methodological characteristics of the studies and the characteristics of the samples were not significant. The descriptive data drawn from this meta-analysis were used to identify the studies' limitations. Recommendations for future research in the area are discussed.

AB  - A context-process-outcomes model was proposed to examined the effect of a variety of factors associated with divorce on post-divorce coparental relationship in a sample of joint physical custody parents with children aged between 4years and 12 years old (50-50) (n = 38). Parents completed questionnaires evaluating quality of coparental relationship. This variable is analyzed through 2 indicators: the parenting alliance and the hostility. The results revealed that attachment between former spouses and the kind of legal decision emerged as significant predictors of coparental relationship. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, higher level of preoccupation was found to predict more supportive parental alliance. Implications for research and intervention are discussed.

AB  - This systematic review examines studies conducted since the year 2000 on the adjustment of children (0-18 years) in joint custody (30/70%) and on the associated family factors (i.e., parenting and interparental conflict). Studies were extracted following PRISMA. Sixteen quantitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen assessed internalizing adjustment and 10 examined externalizing adjustment. Only 2 were rated as having high quality. Limitations included cross-sectional design, reliance in single informant, failure to adjust for important characteristics and no theoretical approach. The results show that the adjustment level of children in joint custody is as good, if not better, than that of those in sole custody. It also shows however that interparental conflict, parental practices, and the parents' mental health generally play a more influential role. In regard to conflictual contexts, studies are beginning to identify, particularly in joint custody, risk factors such as strict arrangements and concerns about the children's safety.

AB  - The literature on parental satisfaction, adjustment, and relitigation in joint custody (JC) versus sole custody (SC) following divorce is reviewed. Findings are summarized for custody differences in parental demographics; time spent with father; the father-child relationship; parental satisfaction with custody; parental adjustment, including self-esteem and parenting stress or burden; conflict between ex-spouses; and relitigation. JC was associated with equivalent or better outcomes than SC in the father-child relationship, parenting stress, parental conflict and relitigation, and overall adjustment. Satisfaction with custody is greatest for both mothers and fathers when they have SC, less in JC, and least for noncustodial parents. Future researchers need larger, more representative samples followed over time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - ABSTRACT The current study examined the influence of post-separation co-parental conflict on participants' self-efficacy and current distress, through the Cooperative-Competitive Parental Conflict Model. Participants were a community sample of 77 people who experienced parental separation as a child. Cooperative co-parenting was positively associated with good fathering, good mothering, and negatively associated with blaming father/mother for the separation, loss, and abandonment, and seeing life through the separation. Low self-efficacy, blaming mother, and acceptance of the separation predicted participant's current distress. The findings highlight the impact of post-separation co-parental conflict on children's self-efficacy and current distress. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many children who experience parental divorce are found to lack confidence in their adult romantic relationships. The current study utilized a quantitative research design to look at specific factors contributing to this lack of relationship confidence. Individuals participated in an online survey assessing relationship confidence and co-parenting abilities by their parents. The study looked at positive co-parenting, negative co-parenting, gender, age at time of divorce, educational level and relationship status as possible factors regarding lack of relationship confidence. Despite the initial hypotheses not being supported, further results were congruent with previous literature indicating that when positive aspects of co-parenting are displayed, more positive aspects are elevated and negative aspects actually decrease. Also, results showed that women's reports of being exposed to conflict were significant over males, which is also congruent with previous literature. These results would be beneficial to incorporate into Massachusetts's mandatory class that divorcing individuals with minor children have to take in order to inform parents of the effects of co-parenting during the divorce process. This information could assist in breaking the vicious cycle of divorce that can be present in families. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: The practice of joint physical custody, where children spend equal time in each parent's home after they separate, is increasing in many countries. It is particularly common in Sweden, where this custody arrangement applies to 30 per cent of children with separated parents. The aim of this study was to examine children's health-related quality of life after parental separation, by comparing children living with both parents in nuclear families to those living in joint physical custody and other forms of domestic arrangements. METHODS: Data from a national Swedish classroom study of 164,580 children aged 12 and 15-years-old were analysed by two-level linear regression modelling. Z-scores were used to equalise scales for ten dimensions of wellbeing from the KIDSCREEN-52 and the KIDSCREEN-10 Index and analysed for children in joint physical custody in comparison with children living in nuclear families and mostly or only with one parent. RESULTS: Living in a nuclear family was positively associated with almost all aspects of wellbeing in comparison to children with separated parents. Children in joint physical custody experienced more positive outcomes, in terms of subjective wellbeing, family life and peer relations, than children living mostly or only with one parent. For the 12-year-olds, beta coefficients for moods and emotions ranged from -0.20 to -0.33 and peer relations from -0.11 to -0.20 for children in joint physical custody and living mostly or only with one parent. The corresponding estimates for the 15-year-olds varied from -0.08 to -0.28 and from -0.03 to -0.13 on these subscales. The 15-year-olds in joint physical custody were more likely than the 12-year-olds to report similar wellbeing levels on most outcomes to the children in nuclear families. CONCLUSIONS: Children who spent equal time living with both parents after a separation reported better wellbeing than children in predominantly single parent care. This was particularly true for the 15-year-olds, while the reported wellbeing of 12-years-olds was less satisfactory. There is a need for further studies that can account for the pre and post separation context of individual families and the wellbeing of younger age groups in joint physical custody.

AB  - This study compared the psychological symptoms of 129 children in joint physical custody with children in single care and nuclear families, using a nationally representative 2011 survey of 1,297 Swedish children aged between four and 18 years. The outcome measure was the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and its association with three dimensions of parental life satisfaction was investigated. Linear regression analyses showed higher SDQ-scores for children in joint physical custody (B = 1.4, p < 0.001) and single care (B = 2.2, p < 0.001) than in nuclear families, after adjustment for socio-demographic variables. The estimates decreased to 1.1 and 1.3, respectively, after being adjusted for parental life satisfaction (p < 0.01). Our findings confirm previous research that showed lower symptom scores for children in nuclear families than children in single care and joint physical custody. Parental life satisfaction should be investigated further as a possible explanation of differences in symptom load between children in different living arrangements.

AB  - Background: In many Western countries, an increasing number of children with separated parents have joint physical custody, that is, live equally much in their parent's respective homes. In Sweden, joint physical custody is particularly common and concerns between 30% and 40% of the children with separated parents. It has been hypothesised that the frequent moves and lack of stability in parenting may be stressful for these children. Methods: We used data from a national classroom survey of all sixth and ninth grade students in Sweden (N = 147839) to investigate the association between children's psychosomatic problems and living arrangements. Children in joint physical custody were compared with those living only or mostly with one parent and in nuclear families. We conducted sex-specific linear regression analyses for z-transformed sum scores of psychosomatic problems and adjusted for age, country of origin as well as children's satisfaction with material resources and relationships to parents. Clustering by school was accounted for by using a two-level random intercept model. Results: Children in joint physical custody suffered from less psychosomatic problems than those living mostly or only with one parent but reported more symptoms than those in nuclear families. Satisfaction with their material resources and parent-child relationships was associated with children's psychosomatic health but could not explain the differences between children in the different living arrangements. Conclusions: Children with non-cohabitant parents experience more psychosomatic problems than those in nuclear families. Those in joint physical custody do however report better psychosomatic health than children living mostly or only with one parent. Longitudinal studies with information on family factors before and after the separation are needed to inform policy of children's postseparation living arrangements.

AB  - Aim: Joint physical custody (JPC), where children spend about equal time in both parent's homes after parental separation, is increasing. The suitability of this practice for preschool children, with a need for predictability and continuity, has been questioned. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we used data on 3656 Swedish children aged three to five years living in intact families, JPC, mostly with one parent or single care. Linear regression analyses were conducted with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, completed by parents and preschool teachers, as the outcome measure. Results: Children in JPC showed less psychological problems than those living mostly (adjusted B 1.81; 95% CI [0.66 to 2.95]) or only with one parent (adjusted B 1.94; 95% CI [0.75 to 3.13]), in parental reports. In preschool teacher reports, the adjusted Betas were 1.27, 95% CI [0.14 to 2.40] and 1.41, 95% CI [0.24 to 2.58], respectively. In parental reports, children in JPC and those in intact families had similar outcomes, while teachers reported lower unadjusted symptom scores for children in intact families. Conclusion: Joint physical custody arrangements were not associated with more psychological symptoms in children aged 3-5, but longitudinal studies are needed to account for potential preseparation differences.

AB  - AIM: Joint physical custody, children spending equal time in each parents' respective home after a parental divorce, is particularly common in Nordic compared with other Western countries. Older children have been shown to fare well in this practice but for young children there are few existing studies. The aim of this paper is to study psychological problems in 2- to 9-year-old Nordic children in different family forms. METHODS: Total symptom score according to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire as well as scores showing externalizing problems were compared among 152 children in joint physical custody, 303 in single care and 3207 in nuclear families through multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: Children in single care had more psychological symptoms than those in joint physical custody (B = 1.08; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.67) and those in nuclear families had the least reported symptoms (B = -0.53; 95% CI -0.89 to -0.17). Externalizing problems were also lower in nuclear families (B = -0.28, 95% CI -0.52 to -0.04) compared with joint physical custody after adjusting for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Young children with non-cohabiting parents suffered from more psychological problems than those in intact families. Children in joint physical custody had a lower total problem score than those in single care after adjusting for covariates. Longitudinal studies with information on family factors before the separation are needed to inform policy of young children's post-separation living arrangements.

AB  - Joint physical custody (JPC) refers to a practice where children with separated parents share their time between the parents' respective homes. Studies on parents' views of JPC for young children are scarce. The aim of this interview study was to explore parents' perceptions on how they experience and practice equally shared JPC for their 1-4 year-olds in Sweden. Forty-six parents (18 fathers and 28 mothers) of 50 children (31 boys and 19 girls) under 5 years of age were interviewed. Parents were recruited through information in the media and represented a broad range of socioeconomic backgrounds, as well as both voluntary and court-ordered custody arrangements. The interviews were semi-structured and analyzed using systematic text condensation. Two themes emerged regarding the research question. In the first theme, Always free, never free, parents described their striving to coparent without a love relationship. While they appreciated the freedom of being a "half-time parent", doing things one's own way, they felt constrained by the long-term commitment to live close to and keep discussing child rearing issues with the ex-partner. Good communication was key and lessened parent's feelings of being cut-off from half of the child's life. When JPC was ordered by court or conflicts were intense, parents tried to have less contact and worried when the children were in the other home. The second theme, Is it right, is it good?, included descriptions of how the parents monitored the child's responses to the living arrangement and made changes to optimize their adjustment. Adaptations included visits for the child with the other parent mid-week, shared meals or adapting schedules. In conclusion, these parents worked hard to make JPC work and cause minimal damage to their children. Most parents were pleased with the arrangements with the notable exception of couples experiencing ongoing conflict. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Parental separation has been associated with adverse child mental health outcomes in the literature. For school-aged children, joint physical custody (JPC), that is, spending equal time in both parents' homes after a divorce, has been associated with better health and well-being than single care arrangements. Preschool children's well-being in JPC is less studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of living arrangements and coparenting quality with mental health in preschool children after parental separation. Methods: This cross-sectional population-based study includes 12 845 three-year-old children in Sweden. Mental health was measured by parental reports of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire and coparenting quality with a four-item scale. The living arrangements of the 642 children in non-intact families were categorised into JPC, living mostly with one parent and living only with one parent. Results: Linear regression models, adjusted for sociodemographic confounders, showed an association between increased mental health problems and living mostly and only with one parent (B=1.18; 95% CI 0.37 to 2.00, and B=1.20; 95% CI 0.40 to 2.00, respectively), while children in intact families vs JPC did not differ significantly (B=-0.11; 95% CI -0.58 to 0.36). After adjusting the analyses for coparenting quality, differences in child mental health between the post divorce living arrangements were, however, minimal while children in intact families had more mental health problems compared with JPC (B=0.70; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.15). Factorial analysis of covariance revealed that low coparenting quality was more strongly related to mental health problems for children in intact families and JPC compared with children living mostly or only with one parent. Conclusions: This study suggests that coparenting quality is a key determinant of mental health in preschool children and thus should be targeted in preventive interventions.

AB  - Dual residence, where children live with each parent for approximately equal amounts of time, is increasingly common for children who have experienced parental separation or divorce. This article explores the perspectives of Swedish children growing up in dual residence arrangements, focusing on their influence over the residence arrangements and practices therein. Alternating one's home life across two households requires organizing and a great deal of decision-making to make everyday life work for children and their families. Drawing on twenty qualitative in-depth interviews with children aged 9 to 17, this paper explores these decision-making practices. Findings demonstrate that children want to have the choice to influence and take part in the decision-making practices of their dual-residence arrangements, and that most children do influence the way their dual-residence arrangements are shaped albeit to different degrees. However, some children are prevented from having this influence despite their wish to have a say. Barriers and enablers are further discussed in relation to children's influence within their families. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Over the past decades, the ways in which children’s care is arranged after parental separation have changed significantly in many societies. Dual residence, where children live across two households spending equal amounts of time with each parent, is particularly common in Sweden. Despite the dramatic increase in dual residence in Sweden, knowledge from children’s point of view is limited. This thesis aims, through children’s perspectives, to provide knowledge about everyday life when lived across two households, with a special focus on family practices, influence and personal relationships. The thesis draws on qualitative interviews with children and teenagers, whose stories, descriptions and reflections have been analysed using thematic analysis. Both theoretically and methodologically, the basis of this thesis is the sociology of childhood, in which the active and reflective roles of children are accentuated. This perspective guides the analysis, highlighting the ways in which children participate in, and influence, decisions regarding how their dual-residence arrangements are put into practice. Family life is understood as a process of doing, and the concept of family practices is adopted to shed light on the particular practices that constitute everyday life for children in dual residence arrangements. The thesis includes four articles, each of which illuminates a separate theme. Article I, II and III are empirical articles highlighting different aspects of everyday life in the context of dual residence, and the fourth article is a literature review. Article I focuses on dual residence as a mobility practice, emphasizing the practical, emotional and relational transitions involved when children live in and move between two homes. Participants’ reflections about relationships with parents are discussed in Article II. Article III focuses on children’s influence over their residence arrangements and practices therein. Article IV investigates the meta-data of the research on dual residence (when, where, who, and how) and their purposes and study findings (what). In summary, findings illuminate the nuances and the everyday complexities of living in two homes. Routinely managing practical and emotional transitions requires effort, even if they become an ordinary part of life to which many children become acclimatised. These transitions may also lead children to reflect about family relationships and think more explicitly about what they mean to them. Taken together, the thesis demonstrates that dual residence involves both positive and negative aspects where children’s experiences differ and change over time. In the final part of the thesis, key elements that influence children’s well-being and the way they feel about practising dual residence are discussed. Children’s relationships lie at the centre of dual-residence family life and they play a crucial role in the way dual residence is experienced. By focusing children’s perspectives, this thesis sheds light on how dual residence can be understood, it highlights the significance of listening to children and considering their views regarding issues that affect their lives.

AB  - ABSTRACT Dual residence is a post-divorce living arrangement where children spend up to 50% of their time in each parent's household after separation or divorce. Reflecting societal changes and shifting norms, these arrangements have increased in many Western societies during recent years. The consequences for children have attracted much interest, resulting in a growing body of research. This literature review has a broad scope, reviewing three decades' international research about children's dual-residence arrangements (111 peer-reviewed articles in total) with the aim of analysing the development of the research field. Findings demonstrate that research on the topic has progressed since the first-generation studies and reached several important conclusions. However, it is geographically restricted and heterogeneous in terms of disciplinary perspectives, the choice of aspects to investigate, methodology, data and research design. Furthermore, diverse terms, definitions and cultural, demographic and jurisdictional contexts complicate cross-country comparisons. While some distinct components of dual-residence arrangements seem to increase the likelihood of positive outcomes for children, this study points out the difficulties in using the cumulative body of research in the field when drawing conclusions and making recommendations for practice. Despite the rapidly growing body of research, essential gaps in our understanding of dual residence still remain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study addresses a particular form of child psychological maltreatment, exposing a child to alienating behaviors in the context of a high degree of conflict between the parents. The objective of this research was to identify retrospectively the alienating behaviors that occurred in an Italian sample of children and the reported associated psychosocial symptoms. Seven hundred and thirty-nine adults in Chieti, Italy, completed an anonymous and confidential survey regarding their childhood exposure to parental alienating behaviors and measures of current symptomatology. About 75% of the sample reported some exposure to parental alienating behaviors; 15% of the sample endorsed the item, "tried to turn me against the other parent." The results revealed strong and statistically significant associations between reported exposure to parental alienating behaviors and reports of current symptomatology.

AB  - In the past years abundant research analyzed the social, relational, and individual aspects of separated parents to better understand the factors which may protect or make parents and children at risk, but still little research has shown an "integrated perspective" on separation. This study is an attempt to adopt an integrated perspective to improve scientific knowledge on separation. In this study we examined the link between social (social network size, frequency of social contacts, relationships with families of origin), relational (coparenting, parents' alienation, perceived violence, and parentification), and individual factors (anxiety and depression, satisfaction with life, self-esteem, sense of coherence, and generativity) and parents' and children's wellbeing. The results showed that fathers and mothers presented different paths of separation: more conflicting for fathers and less conflicting for mothers. Our data, however, showed a weaker and more complex role of fathers than mothers. The frequency of social contacts was linked to a more positive perception of the former partner's behaviors and to numerous aspects of parents' wellbeing, confirming the protective role of social networks as well as of the support received by the former partner's family of origin. An extremely critical aspect was parentification behaviors that were linked to the malaise not only of the child, but also of the parents. The variables most correlated with parents' and children's well being were one's own and the former partner's coparenting abilities as well as parents' sense of coherence: being cooperative parents, that are able to speak and support each other as well as able to manage and understand their social reality, is clearly a protective factor for children's wellbeing.

AB  - An increasing number of divorced parents in Western countries have joint physical custody of their children. A comparative study of children in 36 European, Mediterranean, and North American countries found that 0-4% spend about half their time in two homes. Such arrangements were virtually unknown in many Southern and Eastern European countries while they were more common than single father households in Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, and Sweden. Impaired communication with both mother and father was significantly less likely in joint physical custody than in other non-intact families. Impaired communication with mother was equally prevalent in intact families and joint physical custody families while impaired communication with father was in fact less prevalent in joint physical custody than intact families.

AB  - This paper examines differences in life satisfaction among children in different family structures in 36 western, industrialised countries ( n = 184 496). Children living with both biological parents reported higher levels of life satisfaction than children living with a single parent or parent-step-parent. Children in joint physical custody reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction than their counterparts in other types of non-intact families. Controlling perceived family affluence, the difference between joint physical custody families and single mother or mother-stepfather families became non-significant. Difficulties in communicating with parents were strongly associated with less life satisfaction but did not mediate the relation between family structure and life satisfaction. Children in the Nordic countries characterised by strong welfare systems reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction in all living arrangements except in single father households. Differences in economic inequality between countries moderated the association between certain family structures, perceived family affluence and life satisfaction.

AB  - Policymakers and researchers are concerned with whether joint physical custody (JPC) produces better outcomes for children than sole custody. Although several review articles summarizing up to 61 empirical articles demonstrate very positive answers, many of the research designs used compromise the ability to claim that it is JPC per se-and not selection effects-that causes the effect. We discuss several research design issues, such as propensity score analysis, that can more powerfully probe the question of causality. Some studies have already been conducted employing these strategies and more are recommended and likely to soon be forthcoming. On the basis of this comprehensive review we conclude that JPC probably does cause benefits to children on average, and that social scientists can now provisionally recommend rebuttably presumptive JPC to policymakers.

AB  - For many years there has been an ongoing discussion in research and media regarding the possible consequences of shared residence for children and adolescents, and how growing up in two homes may affect young people’s lives. The purpose of this thesis has been to investigate the relationship between family structure, psychosocial resources and adolescent life satisfaction. More specifically, the intention has been to investigate whether reported life satisfaction varies between adolescents who have shared residence and those living with both parents. Another objective was to examine how adolescent relationships with parents, friends, school and their self-image or self-worth impact their reported life satisfaction. By focusing on variations of family life and social resources, the thesis takes a positive perspective on shared living by looking at what contributes to a happy life for young people. The study at hand is based on data obtained from the Ungdata survey Young in Oslo conducted in Oslo kommune in 2018. The survey was conducted by the Norwegian Institute for Research on Growth, Welfare and Aging (NOVA). The study has 7271 respondents from high school in Oslo kommune. Results from the study show that adolescents with strong parental and peer relationships, well-being at schooland a positive self-image report higher levels of life satisfaction, regardless of family structure. Furthermore, it cannot be concluded that there is a difference in reported life satisfaction between adolescents who have shared residence and youth living with both parents. Additionally, the results show that adolescents' reported life satisfaction varies with their relationships with parents, friends, school and self-image. The results of the study contribute to increased knowledge about variations in family life and the factors that promote a good quality of life for adolescents, whether they have one or two homes.

Formålet med denne oppgaven har vært å undersøke sammenhengen mellom familiestruktur, psykososiale ressurser og ungdoms livstilfredshet. Mer spesifikt har hensikten vært å undersøke om rapportert livstilfredshet varierer mellom ungdom som har delt bosted og ungdom som bor med begge foreldrene sine. Videre var et mål å undersøke hvordan ungdoms relasjoner til foreldre, venner, skolen og deres selvbilde har betydning for deres rapporterte livstilfredshet. Oppgaven inntar et positivt perspektiv på delt bosted og familieliv ved å se på hva som bidrar til at ungdom er tilfredse med livet. Oppgaven baserer seg på data hentet fra Ungdata-undersøkelsen Ung i Oslo gjennomført i Oslo kommune i 2018. Undersøkelsen er utført av Norsk institutt for forskning om oppvekst, velferd og aldring (NOVA). Studien har 7271 respondenter fra videregående skole i Oslo kommune. Resultater fra studien viser at ungdom med gode foreldre- og vennskapsrelasjoner, høy skoletrivsel og et positivt selvbilde rapporterer om høy livstilfredshet uavhengig av familiestruktur. Studien kan det ikke konkludere med at det er forskjell i rapportert livstilfredshet mellom ungdom som har delt bosted og ungdom som bor med begge foreldrene. Resultatene viser at ungdoms rapporterte livstilfredshet varierer med deres relasjoner til foreldre, venner, skolen og selvbilde. Oppgavens resultater bidrar med økt kunnskap om variasjoner i familieliv og hvilke faktorer som fremmer god livskvalitet for ungdom, om de har ett eller to hjem.

AB  - The current study examined children's experiences of sibling relationships following parental separation. Areas investigated included the nature of sibling relationships in separated families, how siblings provide care and support to each other, and how they view sibling relationships in general. To obtain a holistic, context-sensitive understanding of sibling relationships, the study involved a multimethod, multi-source, case study approach that included interviews, sentence completion items, drawings, and vignettes. Three families participated in approximately five to six sessions each. Children and parents participated in individual sessions, and the children participated in one session with their siblings. Through cross-case, qualitative analyses, several salient themes relevant to sibling relationships in separated families were identified. Such themes include the importance of context in understanding sibling relationships (e.g., developmental phase of sibling relationship, custody arrangements, co-parenting relationship); the role of negotiating time with each parent; the impact of physical context; how shared experiences might shape sibling relationships in separated families; and the indirect ways in which siblings support each other. Relevant research and clinical implications when working with children are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper uses recent longitudinal data about a cohort of young children born in the United States to mostly unmarried parents to examine the association between increasingly-complex patterns of family instability and physical health in early childhood. The analyses assess whether, and how, the association between family instability and child health varies across a number of family types. We consider several measures of children's health at age five (overweight/obesity, asthma diagnosis and overall health) and examine to what extent the association between family instability and child health varies across outcomes and depends on the number and timing of any familial transitions. We also explore a number of potential mechanisms through which family instability may affect child health. The results suggest that familial instability is related to worse child health, particularly among children born to coresident (married or cohabiting) biological parents and for children who experience high levels of residential instability.

AB  - This study seeks (1) to study nonresident father involvement and (2) analyze whethernonresident father involvement is related to children's self-esteem after divorce. Eighty-three divorced mothers and 96 children from Seville (Spain) were interviewed. Children were between 6 and 14 years old (M = 9.21; SD = 1.94). Families were accessed through the primary schools where the children attended. The results showed heterogeneity in nonresident father involvement: the contact frequency varied between those who had no relationship with their father and those who saw him weekly or daily; the majority of children (88%) assessed the relationship with their father as positive; 38.5% of them stayed overnight with him; 80.2% of the fathers did not participate in any important decision regarding his children, and almost half of the fathers (46.8%) failed to pay the amount established by the judge. Results indicated that children had a medium level of self-esteem (M = 2.96; SD = 0.53). Finally, data showed a significant relationship between children's self-esteem and the quality of the father-child relationship (F-(1,F-73) = 5.92, p < 0.01). These results could improve children ' s self-esteem after parental divorce by considering the importance of the nonresident father's involvement.

AB  - This paper draws on interviews with 22 children conducted as part of a larger qualitative study during which 60 parents were interviewed once a year over three years (2009-2011) about their post-separation parenting and financial arrangements, to explore any changes to these over time. The main aim was to examine children's own descriptions and views of their parenting arrangements, with a particular focus on children currently or previously in shared time parenting arrangements, including their input into their parenting arrangements and any changes to those arrangements. Half of the children described changes to their parenting arrangements over time (in most cases from shared time to primary care, but in some cases towards greater sharing of time) and most of these children said they had input into their changed arrangements. Children who spoke positively about shared time described close relationships with cooperative parents who lived within close proximity and who were flexible about changing or swapping days. Children who spoke negatively about shared time identified the distance between their parents' homes and/or parental conflict as key issues. Key factors prompting change were conflict with step-parents or step-siblings, distance between homes and wanting one home base. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Background: The increase in shared physical custody in Sweden has been dramatic; 20 years ago only a small percentage of adolescents lived in shared physical custody, but currently ~30% of the adolescents whose parents have separated or divorced divide their residence between parents. We hypothesized that living in shared physical custody or in a single-parent family is associated with a higher prevalence of adolescent risk behaviour than living in a two-parent family. Methods: Data on 15-year-old adolescents from the 2005/2006 to 2009/2010 Swedish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey were analysed using logistic regression. Results: Adolescents living in shared physical custody had slightly higher rates of risk behaviour compared with adolescents from two-parent families, but significantly lower rates than their counterparts from single-parent families. Their odds of being a smoker or having been drunk were 60 and 50% higher, respectively, than those of their counterparts in two-parent families. Conclusion: Shared physical custody after marriage break-up seems to constitute a health protective factor for adolescents' health and problem behaviour. In order to deepen our understanding of the positive and negative aspects of shared physical custody, our study should be followed by qualitative analyses and longitudinal studies of adolescents' experiences.

AB  - Aim: In Sweden, shared physical custody following a parental separation has emerged as means for children to keep close relationships with both parents. Previous studies show that children benefit from regular contact with both parents, who share responsibility for their social, emotional and economic welfare. In this study, we investigate any associations between family arrangements, that is, two-parent, single and shared physical custody families and child health outcomes and whether this association was modified by parent-child communication. Methods: Data on 11- to 15-year-old children from the 2005/2006 and 2009/2010 Swedish Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Children in shared physical custody were more likely than children in two-parent families to report multiple health complaints (OR 1.26) and low well-being (OR 1.71). When variables of parent-child communication were entered in the model, the initial differences remained between children living in shared physical custody and those living in two-parent families. Conclusion: Children in shared physical custody and single-parent families are more at risk of negative outcomes compared with children in two-parent families. This association was not modified by parent-child communication in children in shared custody families, indicating that the communication equals that in two-parent family children.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore children's views about their involvement in the post-separation arrangements that were made in their families and via the court process in the light of three theoretical models. It distinguishes between various aspects of children's participation, a term that carries a number of meanings and is used in various ways. In particular, it examines children's reasons for wanting to be involved or not, and the association between the amount of say children thought they had had, how much say they wanted, and the perceived fairness of the arrangements and their happiness with them.

AB  - Between the 1970s and 1990s, state custody laws moved from maternal preference to the "best interests of the child" doctrine, which gives fathers and mothers equal treatment in child custody assignment. We exploit exogenous variation across states in the timing of this custody law change to estimate the long-term implications of exposure to a gender-neutral custody law regime. We find that childhood exposure to gender neutral custody laws has a negative effect on educational attainment. A child exposed to gender neutral custody law is less likely to graduate from high school by 1.5 to 2.0 percentage points.

AB  - Experiencing parental divorce during adolescence has been associated with a number of negative adolescent outcomes. A high level of parental conflict has been identified as an important determinant of adolescents' adjustment to their parents' divorce. This study sought to examine the relationships between level of parental conflict, custody and visitation arrangements, and negative adolescent outcomes. This research is based on archival data obtained in the course of a forensic child custody evaluation, and utilized a sample of 89 couples and 196 pre-adolescents and adolescents. Results demonstrated that higher levels of parental conflict were associated with a greater number of negative adolescent outcomes. It was also found that children whose parents had joint custody experienced fewer negative adolescent outcomes than those who were in the sole custody of one parent. These results suggest several important implications for practice, policy, and future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Young South African fathers are often engaged in their children's lives even if they do not live together. Using longitudinal data on children (n = 1,209) from the Cape Town area, the authors show that although only 26% of young fathers live with their children, 66% of nonresidential fathers maintain regular contact, and 61% provide financial support. The father-child relationship, however, is embedded in broader family ties. The type of father-mother relationship is strongly associated with whether fathers coreside with their children but not with fathers' contact with nonresidential children. Close mother and maternal grandmother bonds reduce the likelihood that fathers live with their children, whereas close ties between fathers and paternal grandmothers increase the chance that fathers visit nonresidential children. Family ties do not affect fathers' financial contributions, which are driven by men's current economic situation. These findings illustrate that father-child relationships are best understood in the context of interacting family systems. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current project sought to examine young adult children's perceptions of six types of concerns that parents may have during a divorce: concerns about power, malice, finances, esteem, child rejection, and custody. Three hundred thirteen young adults who reported experiencing parental divorce between the ages of 10 and 17 were asked to complete an online survey assessing their perceptions of parental concerns, acrimonious parent interactions, parent-child relationships, and well-being. Although there was a lack of distinction between perceived concerns about power and malice, these scales demonstrated several expected associations and results were fairly robust, suggesting that young adults' perceptions of their parents' concerns regarding conflict (encompassing both power and malice) are important. The perceived custody concerns scale demonstrated a unique pattern of results in which it was associated with higher parent acrimony but also with higher parent-child warmth, suggesting that young adults' perceptions of parents' custody concerns are also important, and different from other types of concerns. Hypotheses regarding the finances, esteem, and child rejection scales were unsupported or poorly supported, however, which raises questions about the extent to which it is meaningful to assess young adults' perceptions of these types of concerns. Overall, the hypothesis that young adults would be able to distinguish between six types of divorce-related parental concerns was not supported. Rather, the results suggest that young adult children of divorced parents may perceive parental concerns with less specificity, as only two distinct and meaningful general categories of concerns were identified: concerns related to inter-parent conflict and custody.

AB  - This longitudinal study, carried out among 78 divorcing and divorced parents in Israel, examined changes in their coparenting over a 2-year period and the contribution of their coparenting behaviors and defense mechanisms, at three time points, to their quality of life at Time 3. Data were collected between 2007 and 2009. At Time 1 couples appeared in the family court, and Times 2 and 3 were 1 and 2 years later, respectively. The main findings show that (1) both parents' participation and consideration decreased over time, (2) both tension/hostility with the spouse and low level of mature defense mechanisms eroded the participants' quality of life, (3) the ability of tension/hostility to undermine the participants' quality of life exceeded the ability of mature defense mechanisms to improve it, (4) the negative impact of the participants' coparenting relationship and immature defense mechanisms in the first year endured to the third year, and (5) being free of health problems contributed significantly to the participants' quality of life. The limitations, contributions, and practical implications of the study are noted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The United States and Canada have been experiencing major changes in family formation and dissolution over the past decades. Within this context, the French-Canadian Province of Quebec has consistently been at the forefront-in 2011, for example, 37.8 per cent of Quebec couples were cohabitants and 63 per cent of births were from nonmarried parents. Is this difference strictly due to Quebec's distinct social and cultural characteristics or can the Quebec experience be seen as a predictor of things to come for the rest of Canada and the United States? This article discusses the causes of these new behaviors in Quebec, presents changes in the Canadian legal system to facilitate less adversarial procedures, and reports the results of a Quebec longitudinal study exploring the relationship between child adjustment and custody arrangements. The quality of the psychological and relational environment in which the child lives is shown to be more important than the type of family structure and custody arrangement. Keypoints for the Family Court Community 1. Family structure changes in Quebec and Canada. 2. Divorce less adversarial dispute resolution options. 3. Contribution of child custody arrangement to postseparation child well-being. 4. Moderating factors of child well-being in separated divorced families. 5. Emotional well-being, parenting practices, and household income of mothers with joint versus sole custody. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to understand how coparenting, parental involvement, and parenting practices influence the dynamics of binuclear families. Method: A search was carried out in the PsycINFO, Web of Science, and BVSPsi databases, which resulted in 17 scientific articles. The studies were analyzed critically concerning the methodological characteristics and the main results. Results: In general, it was observed that coparenting and parental involvement are associated with several factors that protect the psychological health of parents and children after divorce, in line with data found with intact/nuclear families. No research was found on parenting practices within the established search criteria. Possible biases and indications for future investigations and interventions with binuclear families are discussed.

AB  - Background: Parental break-up is wide spread, and the effects of parental break-up on children's well-being are known. The evidence regarding child age at break-up and subsequent family arrangements is inconclusive. Aim: to estimate the effects of parental break-up on stress in pre-adolescent children with a specific focus on age at breakup and post-breakup family arrangements. Methods: We used data from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Participants included 44 509 children followed from birth to age 11. Stress was self-reported by children at age 11, when the children also reported on parental break-up and post break-up family arrangements. Results: Twenty-one percent of the children had experienced a parental break-up at age 11, and those who had experienced parental break-up showed a higher risk of stress (OR:1.72, 95%CI:1.55;1.91) regardless of the child's age at break-up. Children living in a new family with stepparents (OR = 1.63, 95%CI:1.38;1.92), or shared between the parents (OR = 1.48, 95%CI:1.26;1.75) reported higher stress than children of intact families. Single parent families reported markedly higher stress levels than children in intact families (OR = 2.18, 95%CI:1.90;2.50) and all other family types. Children who were satisfied with their living arrangements post-break-up reported the same stress level as children living in intact families (OR = 1.01, 95%CI:0.86;1.18). Conclusion: Children who experience parental break-up have higher stress levels, also many years after the break-up, and those living in a single parent household post break-up seem to be most vulnerable. Living arrangements post-breakup should be further investigated as a potential protective factor. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The goal of the present study was to shed light on the relation between postseparation custody arrangements and family contexts in which school-age children (8-12 years old) live so as to better understand the processes underlying their adjustment. The sample was composed of 112 dyads (parents and children) from families in joint custody (n = 37) or maternal custody (n = 75). The dyads were met with twice at a 1-year interval. Compared with those in joint custody, the respondents with sole custody had a negative opinion of the transitions between homes and had the impression that the children were more involved in interparental conflicts. This analysis showed that the difficult nature of transitions between homes was a crucial mediating variable in the relation between conflicts and the children's adjustment, but that other variables, such as the relational problems with the mother, played a role, particularly in joint custody situations.

AB  - ABSTRACT This study analyzes the associations between living arrangements after a parental separation, and the adolescent's self-rated health and life satisfaction in French-speaking Belgium. Data are based on 39,294 adolescents who participated in the three waves of the cross-sectional HBSC survey. Among adolescents living with separated parents, the self-rated health was not associated with living arrangements after adjustment for the perception of family wealth and the ability to communicate with parents. Adolescent's life satisfaction was not associated with living arrangement when controlled for perceived family wealth in 2014 and controlled for quality of communication with parents in 2010 and 2018.

AB  - Supportive coparenting after relationship dissolution is associated with increased father involvement which can buffer against the negative effects of parental relationship dissolution. Low-income, at-risk families are much more likely to experience relationship dissolutions; hence, supportive coparenting after dissolution is particularly important in these families. We examined whether relationship (commitment and quality) and child (difficult temperament and gender) characteristics predicted initial levels of, and change in, supportive coparenting after relationship dissolution in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 1,603). We used structural equation modeling of latent growth curves to examine four time points collected at the focal child's birth and first, third, and fifth birthdays. Ninety-percent of the mothers had nonmarital births, and about three-quarters had a high school diploma or less education. Overall, supportive coparenting decreased over time. Mothers in more committed relationships prior to the dissolution initially had significantly lower supportive coparenting. But over time, mothers who had been in more committed relationships increased in supportive coparenting. Mothers who had been in higher quality relationships prior to dissolution initially reported more supportive coparenting. At each time point, if a mother was romantically involved with a new partner, she reported significantly lower supportive coparenting compared to mothers who were single. With regard to child characteristics, mothers who reported their child as more difficult had significantly lower initial supportive coparenting. Similar results for fathers are discussed. Overall, the relationship characteristics of parents were important predictors of supportive coparenting both initially and over time. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this grounded theory study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of the paternal parent with regard to how his paternal role changed from being a custodial, residential parent to that of non-residential, non-custodial parent after a divorce. The barriers encountered when trying to remain involved in his child(ren)'s lives were also analyzed. Of particular interest is the father's role and involvement in the academic success, behavior, and social and emotional development of the child(ren) after the dissolution of a marriage. The following questions guided the study: (a) How do non-residential fathers perceive their child(ren)'s post life after the dissolution of a marriage? (b) How do non-residential fathers influence their child(ren)'s academic life? (c) How do non-residential fathers influence their child(ren)'s behavior and social/emotional life? (d) What barriers do non-residential fathers face when trying to remain involved in their child(ren)'s lives? The participants of the student were divorced, non-residential, non-custodial fathers with school aged children under the age of 18. The children attended one of the seven feeder elementary schools to Tesseract High School and one attended Tesseract High School. The participants were divorced less than three years. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a focus group. The participants of this study shared a variety of information. It was revealed that the children of the fathers of this study adjusted well after the divorce. None of the participants revealed significant negative issues with regard to their children's academic success, behavior, and social/emotional development as a result of the father becoming at least part-time non-residential. The participants confirmed many of the barriers that the review of the literature found to remaining involved in their children's lives post-divorce. This study confirmed that the better the relationship is between the mother and father post-divorce, the happier the father is with his involvement with his children.

AB  - Parenting time. interparental conflict, and the quality of parenting a child experiences in the postdivorce family environment have complex relations with child adjustment outcomes. Using person-centered latent profile analyses, the present study examined (a) separate profiles of mothers' (N = 472) and fathers' (N = 353) parenting time, interparental conflict, and quality of parenting following divorce; and (b) associations of mother and father profiles with concurrent child outcomes (48% female, 3- to 18-years-old) as well as child outcomes 3 and 10 months later. Mother and father profiles were primarily differentiated by levels of parenting time and quality of parenting, respectively. Mother and father profiles defined by greater parenting time and lower quality parenting were associated with the poorest child outcomes.

AB  - This paper enriches understandings of the implications of contemporary custody law for mothers and their children. It does so through a discussion of mothers’ grief and emotional pain over involuntarily losing care time with children. Mothers involuntarily lose care time by becoming non-resident parents against their will or by having a shared care parenting order imposed on them. Both experiences of losing maternal care time are becoming more commonplace as a result of the gender neutrality of custody laws across the Anglo-West and the increased emphasis given to shared care parenting as a viable post-separation parenting arrangement. Yet investigations into the emotions engendered by mothers’ loss of care time are sparse. Exploratory qualitative research with twelve mothers who involuntarily lost care time reveals the intensity and durability of their grief, its entanglement with emotions like fear, and its significance, as a relational welfare approach emphasises, to children’s best interests.

AB  - This study analyses the effect of parental separation or divorce on children's educational achievement, and includes parental conflict as a factor of analysis. The study is based on the analysis of the Panel of Families and Children, with a sample of 2,731 adolescents aged between 13 to 16 years old in Catalonia, Spain. The main results show that the children of divorced parents who have a conflicted relationship are more likely to obtain poorer educational results than the children of divorced parents without conflict and two-parent households. However, children of divorced parents with no conflicted relationship are less likely on average to receive a failing grade than those who live in two-parent households.

AB  - Whether children of separated parents 2 years of age and younger should have frequent overnight parenting time with noncustodial fathers has been the subject of much debate but little data. Contrary to some previous findings, the current study found benefits to both parent-child relationships associated with overnights (a) up to and including equal numbers of overnights at both parents' homes, (b) for both the long-term mother-child and father-child relationships, and (c) both when children were 2 years old, as well as when they were under 1 year of age. These benefits held after controlling for subsequent parenting time with fathers in childhood and adolescence, parent education and conflict up to 5 years after the separation, and children's sex and age at separation. While the findings do not establish causality they provide strong support for policies to encourage frequent overnight parenting time for infants and toddlers, because the benefits associated with overnights also held for parents who initially agreed about overnights as well as for those who disagreed and had the overnight parenting plan imposed over 1 parent's objections. The observed benefits for the long-term father-child relationship are consistent with findings from intervention studies showing that fathers who are more involved with infants and toddlers develop better parenting skills and relationships with their children.

AB  - Previous research has indicated that there tends to be "maternal drift" from shared parenting time back towards primary mother care in the few years after parental separation. This article explores this issue further. It presents findings from a qualitative study in Victoria, conducted from 2009 to 2011, that examined the links over time between parenting arrangements and financial arrangements - in particular, whether mothers and children suffered financial disadvantage if time sharing reverted to primary mother care. Sixty parents were interviewed once a year over three years, with a sample of 22 children also interviewed in the final year. Key themes from the data include the importance of having cooperative, flexible and child-focused parenting relationships, regardless of the parenting time split; the ongoing role of mothers as the main caregivers and decision-makers for children; fathers' satisfaction with shared time; the often divisive role played by new partners; and the negative effects of family violence when perpetrators continued to exercise control through parenting arrangements.

AB  - Objective We consider the prevalence of family complexity and its association with children's externalizing behavior problems over children's life course and over historical time. Background A growing literature has demonstrated the prevalence and multidimensional nature of family complexity and its association with child behavior. The nature/strength of this association may have changed in recent cohorts as family complexity has become more normative. Method Data are from the 1997 and 2014 cohorts of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement. Samples represent U.S. children aged 0-12 years born since 1985 (N = 5,030). Ordinary least squares regression estimated change in the association between family complexity and behavior between cohorts. Difference-in-difference models estimated baseline and longitudinal differences in children's behavior as linked to family complexity. Results The prevalence of family complexity has stabilized over the last two decades, and the antecedents to parental repartnering and complex sibship organization remain similar. The expectation that increasing family complexity contributes to elevated behavior problem scores was not supported. Instead, children who eventually acquired a step- or half-sibling or who experienced parents' union dissolution had elevated behavior problems prior to those changes. Conclusion The prevalence of and precursors to complex family organization were stable across recent child cohorts. The observed association between family complexity and child behavior problems may be attributable to selection mechanisms linked to both parents' family formation trajectories and to children's behavior, rather than to family change itself.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, around 50.000 children in Sweden experience a separation between their parents. Joint physical custody (JPC), where the child alternates homes between the parents for about equal amount of time, has become a common living arrangement after parental separation. Children in two homes could benefit from everyday contact with both parents and access to both parents' financial resources. However, children could experience stress from being constantly moving and potentially exposed to parental conflicts. Still, studies on JPC and biological functioning related to stress, are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate how living arrangements (intact family/JPC) relate to HPA-axis activity and recurrent pain in mid-adolescents. METHODS: Mid-adolescents (106 girls and 51 boys) provided demographic details, self-reports of recurrent pain (headache, stomachache, neck/shoulder and back pain) and salivary samples. Salivary cortisol samples were collected: 1) immediately at awakening, 2) +30 minutes, 3) +60 minutes, and 4) at 8 p.m. The cortisol awakening response (CAR) was computed using an established formula. Additionally, the diurnal decline between the waking and 8 p.m. samples was computed. RESULTS: Hierarchical multiple regressions showed that living arrangements (intact family/JPC) was not associated with morning cortisol (CAR), the diurnal cortisol decline or with recurrent pain. However, sex was a significant predictor of both cortisol measures and recurrent pain with girls exhibiting a higher cortisol awakening response and a greater diurnal decline value as well as reporting more recurrent pain than did boys. CONCLUSIONS: Living arrangements were not associated with HPA-axis activity or recurrent pain in this group of well-functioning mid-adolescents. Although this study is the first to investigate how living arrangements relate to HPA-axis functioning and additional studies are needed, the tentative findings suggest that these mid-adolescents have adapted to their living arrangements and that other factors play a more pertinent role for HPA-functioning and subjective health.

AB  - Aims: Increasing proportions of Scandinavian children and children in other Western countries live in joint physical custody, moving between parents' homes when parents live apart. Children and parents in non-intact families are at risk of worse mental health. The potential influence of parental ill-health on child well-being in the context of differing living arrangements has not been studied thoroughly. This study investigates the psychological complaints of children in joint physical custody in comparison to children in sole parental care and nuclear families, while controlling for socioeconomic differences and parental ill-health. Methods: Data were obtained from Statistics Sweden's yearly Survey of Living Conditions 2007-2011 and child supplements with children 10-18 years, living in households of adult participants. Children in joint physical custody (n = 391) were compared with children in sole parental care (n = 654) and children in nuclear families (n = 3,639), using a scale of psychological complaints as the outcome measure. Results: Multiple regression modelling showed that children in joint physical custody did not report higher levels of psychological complaints than those in nuclear families, while children in sole parental care reported elevated levels of complaints compared with those in joint physical custody. Adding socioeconomic variables and parental ill-health only marginally attenuated the coefficients for the living arrangement groups. Low parental education and parental worry/anxiety were however associated with higher levels of psychological complaints. Conclusions: Psychological complaints were lower among adolescents in joint physical custody than in adolescents in sole parental care. The difference was not explained by parental ill-health or socioeconomic variables. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Joint physical custody (JPC) refers to children living alternatively and about equally with both parents after a parental separation or divorce. The practice has been debated in relation to child well-being because of the frequent moves imposed on children and the potential stress from living in 2 homes. This study describes the background to the high frequency of Swedish children in JPC and the results from research on Swedish children's well-being in this living arrangement. Children in JPC report better well-being and mental health than children who live mostly or only with 1 parent. No Swedish studies have found children's health to be worse in JPC than in sole parental care from child age of 3 years and beyond. The existing literature cannot, however, inform us about the mechanisms behind the findings. The risks of selection effects into living arrangements are plausible. For this purpose, longitudinal studies are warranted. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Among children with separated parents, shared residence - i.e., joint physical custody where the child is sharing his or her time equally between two custodial parents' homes - is increasing in many Western countries and is particularly common in Sweden. The overall level of living among children in Sweden is high; however, the potential structural differences between children in various post-separation family arrangements have not been sufficiently studied. Potential risks for children with shared residence relate to the daily hassles and stress when having two homes. This study aims at investigating the living conditions of children with shared residence compared with children living with two custodial parents in the same household and those living with one custodial parent, respectively. Swedish national survey data collected from children aged 10-18 years (n = 5000) and their parents were used. The outcomes were grouped into: Economic and material conditions, Social relations with parents and peers, Health and health behaviors, Working conditions and safety in school and in the neighborhood, and Culture and leisure time activities. Results from a series of linear probability models showed that most outcomes were similar for children with shared residence and those living with two custodial parents in the same household, while several outcomes were worse for children living with one parent. However, few differences due to living arrangements were found regarding school conditions. This study highlights the inequalities in the living conditions of Swedish children, with those living with one parent having fewer resources compared with other children.

AB  - Prior investigations have explored the association between divorce and various outcomes to examine the best interests of youth experiencing parental divorce. Investigated variables associated with the impact of divorce on youth included inter-parental conflict, post-divorce parenting, and level of parental involvement post-divorce. Research suggested that these factors may be related to changes in the areas of self-esteem, and life satisfaction for emerging adults who experienced parental divorce. The purpose of this study was to re-examine these variables in the context of new legal presumptions towards shared parenting and the creation of parenting plans. Specifically, a new residential calendar was utilized to quantify the amount of time spent with each parent and the number of transitions between homes that were experienced. These variables are examined to test their associations with self-esteem and life satisfaction, while controlling for inter-parental conflict and parenting style. Statistically significant results are found for the role of parental support on self-esteem and life satisfaction. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The majority of studies of nonresident father involvement focus on either child support payments or visitation. However, nearly 60% of custodial parents receive in-kind (i.e., noncash) support of some form. Using data from a nationally representative sample of children with nonresident fathers (the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics), we simultaneously investigate via a trivariate probit model the relationships among three aspects of father involvement: child support, in-kind support, and visitation. We find that these dimensions of involvement are positively related and highly intertwined with the strongest positive relationship being between in-kind support and visitation. Additionally, these aspects of involvement have different sets of determinants. Economic characteristics of the resident household are more frequently associated with the receipt of child support, while demographic characteristics of the child, mother, father and resident household are related to all three aspects of nonresident father involvement. Generally speaking, when differences in impacts of determinants vary for lower and higher income resident families, the differences are related to the receipt of child support. Fewer differences are observed with regard to in-kind support receipt or with visitation. Our model also measures how unobserved factors are related to these facets of involvement. Most notable across income groups is that unobserved factors are positively related for child support and in-kind support receipt for higher income resident households. This relationship is insignificant for lower income resident households.

AB  - The recent concentration of divorce and separation among the least advantaged, and the increase in shared physical custody of children raises the question of how such family developments affect social inequalities among children. Our paper contributes to this debate by examining the moderating role of parental socioeconomic background in the relationship between children’s health and well-being and child custody arrangements. From the Spanish ‘Health Behaviour in School-aged Children’ survey, we test the competing compensatory and floor effect hypotheses, distinguishing the separate effects of father’s and mother’s education and occupation on multiple children outcomes, such as psychological complaints and life satisfaction. Our results indicate that growing up in a “non-intact” family still has greater negative consequences for disadvantaged children, and that social inequalities in child health and well-being after separation persist in contemporary Spain.

AB  - As part of the largest, longest running prospective American study of same-sex parent families, the present investigation examined relationship dissolution in planned lesbian families. Data were collected from 40 separated couples and their 17-year-old adolescent offspring-19 girls and 21 boys. Nearly all breakups occurred before the former couples could have obtained the legal equivalent of same-sex marriage in their state of residence. A majority of the mothers rated the communication with their ex-partners as cordial. Seventy-one percent of separated mothers were sharing custody, and they were more likely to do so if the comother had legally adopted the index offspring. There were no differences in adolescent psychological well-being associated with coparent adoption or shared custody. The percentage of adolescents who reported closeness to both mothers was significantly higher in families with coparent adoption. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Co-parenting implies an interplay of roles that is related to the child global care, and involves parents' joint responsibility for the child well being. It was carried a qualitative study with separated\divorced fathers and mothers, focusing on the theme of education and co-parenting after divorce. The results pointed to the importance of connubial relations and parents-children bonds in the exercise of co-parenting. Moreover, co-parenting is also crossed over by cohabitation, parents and children's gender and the financial conditions of the progenitors. In this study, as compared to the literature, fathers were more participative or willing to participate in the education of their children, and mothers were more satisfied with the guard of their children and less guilty of their choices, thus demonstrating new post-divorce scenery.

AB  - Aims: Profound changes in family structure took place in many countries, during the second part of the previous century. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the association between the type of family residency and psychosomatic problems in younger and older adolescents, particularly focusing on alternate residency, and to examine the impact of child-parent relations. Methods: We used data collected in 2009 by Statistics Sweden among 172,298 Swedish students in Grade 6 and Grade 9 (approximate ages 12 and 15 years old); comprising 80% and 86%, respectively, of the entire population of students in those grades. We collected the data with a questionnaire, completed anonymously in school: We used the Psychosomatic Problems (PSP) scale as the outcome measure. Results: The type of family residency showed a weaker association with psychosomatic problems than the child-parent relationships did. Living in non-intact families increased the probability of adolescent psychosomatic problems by 0-0.05, compared to intact families. In Grade 9, there were no differences in psychosomatic problems between the students in alternate residency and those living with their two parents; and in Grade 6, these differences were relatively small. In comparison, a worse relationship with parents increased the probability of psychosomatic problems by 0.11-0.17, depending on the school grade and type of family residency. Conclusions: The structure of the family, as well as the child-parent relationships needs to be taken into account, to properly estimate the magnitude of the family situation as a determinant of adolescent psychosomatic problems. Our results justify universal intervention at the policy level. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Shared residence is often presented as an arrangement that is in the best interests of the child following the divorce of its parents. Based on in-depth interviews with Norwegian children who have experienced shared residence, this article seeks to explore some dilemmas concerning time, agency and the children’s emotions. Three characteristics of shared residence and time-sharing are presented — flexibility, ambiguity and rigidity — which points to different challenges in understanding the circumstances in which shared residence become a valuable arrangement for children. The article argues that both time and emotional dilemmas regarding shared residence should be further investigated both empirically and theoretically, and that children’s agency should be acknowledged more fully.

AB  - I denne rapporten undersøkes barns innflytelse på egen bosteds- og samværsordning når foreldrene
ikke bor sammen. Analysene baserer seg på data fra en intervjuundersøkelse blant foreldre som har
barn sammen, og som ikke bor sammen, samlet inn høst/vinter 2012-2013 av Statistisk Sentralbyrå. I
tillegg til deskriptive framstillinger er det gjennomført analyser ved hjelp av logistisk regresjon.
Undersøkelsen hadde en svarprosent på 59,8.
Rapporten viser at barn har relativt liten innflytelse på samværsavtale, noe større innflytelse på
bosted, men relativt stor innflytelse på når det faktisk skal være hos samværsforelderen. I tråd med
gjeldende lovgivning styrkes barnets innflytelse med økt alder. Grad av innflytelse varierer ellers med
en rekke forhold. Bostedsforeldre rapporterer større innflytelse for barna enn samværsforeldre og
det rapporteres større innflytelse når barnet bor hos far enn hos mor. Foreldre som er misfornøyde
med avtalen og foreldre som har et konfliktfylt forhold rapporterer mindre innflytelse for barna enn
fornøyde og samarbeidende foreldre.
Studien bekrefter et behov for større innsats, slik at barn inkluderes og høres i forbindelse med
etablering av bosteds- og samværsavtaler, men også et behov for å inkludere barn som informanter i
studier når målet er å vurdere barn og unges innflytelse på egen bosteds- og samværsordning når
foreldrene ikke bor sammen

AB  - The increase in shared residential arrangements is driven by the belief that it is in the best interest of the child. The maintenance of contact between child and parents can mitigate negative consequences of separation. However, selection mechanisms may account for a positive relationship between shared residential arrangements and child outcomes. This study examines the association between children's residential arrangements and their school engagement, focusing on the parent-child relationship as a mediator and selection mechanisms. Structural equation models are performed on a sample of 973 secondary school pupils with separated parents from the Leuven Adolescents and Families Study (LAFS; 2008-2011). The results suggest that more parental time is related with a better parent-child relationship, and this leads indirectly to higher school engagement. However, shared residence may also have negative consequences for children and is certainly not the only residential arrangement in which children have a good relationship with both parents.

AB  - Children's post-divorce living arrangements have become increasingly heterogeneous the past decades, because of the rise in shared residence and stepfamily formation. This study investigates how post-divorce living arrangements (i.e. the combination between residential arrangement and stepparent presence) are related to children's school engagement. The focus is put on different explanations of the relation between living arrangements and school engagement, namely financial resources, parent-child relationship, selectivity and stress. Structural equation models are performed on a sample of children with divorced parents from the Leuven Adolescent and Family Study data 2008-2011 (n = 1630). First, the results show that stepfamilies have higher financial resources than single-parent families, but these higher financial resources are not directly related to children's school engagement. Second, parent-child relationship is an important mediator between post-divorce living arrangements and school engagement. The results suggest that shared residence is related to a better fatherchild relationship and in this manner improves school engagement. The relation between stepparent presence and the parent-child relationship is less straightforward, and the findings suggest that the combination of residential arrangement, stepfather and stepmother presence should be taken into account. Third, children's sociodemographic characteristics, time since divorce and level of pre-divorce conflict function as selection mechanisms, as they are related to both post-divorce living arrangements and children's school engagement. Finally, the findings indicate that the complexity of multiple part-time residential figures is stressful to children. This may partially counterbalance the benefits of such systems, via the better parent-child relationship and the higher financial resources.

AB  - Family communication is central to adjusted family functioning, which may be of special relevance to limit the impact of divorce on children. The present study aims to examine positive family communication as a facilitator of family adaptation to divorce, its impact on children's maladjustment, and the role of coparenting. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 309 parents with high interparental-conflict. The expected model was tested using path analysis. We observed that: 1) positive family communication was related to parents' greater psychological adjustment to the divorce and fewer socioeconomic consequences of the divorce on children and indirectly to children's lower anxiety/depression and aggressiveness; 2) supportive coparenting was a protective factor against socioeconomic consequences, but a risk factor in situations of high conflict. These results highlight positive family communication in family adaptation and children's well-being. Furthermore, findings differentiate the divorce conditions in which coparenting may or may not be appropriate. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - AIM: This study compared mental health after parental separation in 7-year-old children living in joint physical custody with sole physical custody family arrangements. METHODS: The study population included 39 661 children from the Danish National Birth Cohort, living in a nuclear family at age 6 months. Child mental health was measured at age 7 years with maternal reports of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) operationalised as a high total score. Associations between living arrangements and mental health were analysed using logistic regression models, taking into account early childhood indicators of family relations, parental mental health and socioeconomic conditions. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the living arrangements after parental separation with joint physical custody having an odds ratio (OR) of 1.37 (95% CI 1.10-1.70), sole physical custody without a new partner OR 1.33 (95% CI 1.19-1.47) and OR 1.55 (95% CI 1.30-1.84) for sole physical custody with new partner, with children in a nuclear family as reference. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that living arrangements after parental separation have a minimal influence on child mental health at age 7 years.

AB  - This study investigated mental health in schoolchildren in different living arrangements after parental separation. The study population included 31,519 children from the Danish National Birth Cohort, followed-up at age 11 in 2010-2014. Child mental health was measured with a maternal report of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Associations between living arrangements and mental health were analyzed using logistic and linear regression models, taking into account early childhood indicators of the parents' relations, income, education and psychiatric care. At age 11, children living in a nuclear family had the lowest rate of total SDQ score, 8.9%. Of the children who had experienced parental separation, children in joint physical custody had the lowest adjusted odds ratio (OR)1.25 (95%-CI 1.09-1.44), for a high SDQ score relative to children living in a nuclear family, with adjusted ORs of 1.63 (1.42-1.86) and OR 1.72 (1.52-1.95) for sole physical custody arrangements with and without a new partner. An analysis of change in SDQ scores between ages 7 and 11 in children showed a similar pattern. This study indicates that joint physical custody is associated with slightly more favorable mental health in schoolchildren after parental separation than sole physical custody arrangements.

AB  - Concern with the impact on children of discontinued parent-child relationships following parental separation or divorce has resulted in a depth of empirical knowledge in the maintenance of those relationships through the medium of 'contact'. While research consistently demonstrates that post-separation/divorce parenting arrangements work best when they are informally arranged between two parents who are committed to making those plans work in the interests of their children, the emotive nature of the separation/divorce experience for many families may demand formal and legal regulation. Research with families involved in post-separation/divorce contact fails to identify a solitary magic ingredient that makes contact work or not work; rather a wide range of factors which operate interactively, interdependently and dynamically, with the attitudes, actions and interactions of the key family players shaping contact and determining its quality. This paper provides a critical review of the international literature on post-separation/divorce contact, identifying and reflecting on the key ingredients or factors central to the successful occurrence of 'quality contact'. Drawing on the literature reviewed, a framework consisting of four separate yet interrelated layers is presented in order to both identify and explore these dynamic factors that quality contact is dependent upon.

AB  - This researcher examined the relationship between custody arrangements and psychological functioning of young adults who experienced parental divorce prior to their 16th birthday. One hundred young adults (ages 18-23) participated in this study. Each participant completed a demographics questionnaire which permitted the assignment of participants to joint physical custody or sole custody groups (i.e., 1-2 days per month or less with the noncustodial parent). Psychological adjustment was measured by participants' performance on four content scales (Depression, Anxiety, Low Self-Esteem, and Family Problems) and one supplementary scale (Ego Strength) of the MMPI-2. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed no statistically significant differences between the joint custody and sole custody participants on the psychological adjustment variables, and there was no statistically significant difference between males and females in either custody condition. Nonetheless, exploratory analyses (i.e., a series of five, hierarchical multiple regression models) were conducted. In these five regression models, the interaction sets (demographic x type of custody arrangement) for Ego Strength and Low Self-Esteem were statistically significant. Additionally, there was a statistically significant main effect of race in predicting the Family Problems outcome. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To test a model linking economic hardship, parenting stress, and nonresident fathers' involvement in single mothers' family life during Black boys' early childhood (3-5 years of age) to harsh parenting and behavior problems in middle childhood (9 years of age). Background: Parenting stress among single mothers heading low-income Black families is poorly understood. Most of the research on the effects of stress in the parenting role and outcomes for mothers and children has focused on middle-class White samples. Boys are of primary interest in this article because of evidence, based largely on studies of economically disadvantaged, two-parent, White families, that boys may be more negatively affected than girls by aspects of family conflict that include harsh and coercive parenting. Method: Using data from a subsample of unmarried Black mothers and nonresident biological fathers with a 3-year-old son (n = 748) from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a nationally representative data set, and survey interviews with mothers when the children were 3, 5, and 9 years of age, we examined relationships between and among mothers' economic hardship, depressive symptoms, parenting stress, father involvement, harsh parenting, and child behavior problems when the children were 3, 5, and 9 years of age. Latent variable structural equation modeling and effect decomposition were estimated. Results: Economic hardship was linked indirectly to harsh parenting through mothers' depressive symptoms and parenting stress, both of which were related directly to increased harsh parenting. Fathers' involvement was associated directly with mothers' reduced economic hardship and reduced parenting stress when children were 3 to 5 years of age, and reduced levels of harsh parenting at 9 years of age. Harsh parenting during middle childhood, in turn, was associated directly and positively with boy's behavior problems at 9 years of age. Conclusion: Nonresident Black fathers' sustained involvement may buffer adverse consequences of stressful conditions on single mothers' parenting. This is important because studies have found that children growing up in households without the involvement of both biological parents are at greater risk for negative developmental and well-being outcomes than their counterparts who grow up in households in which both biological parents are involved. Implications: The most important scientific and policy implications of our results are that intervention approaches that focus on honing relationship and coparenting skills between unmarried nonresident, Black, biological fathers and the mothers of their children early on should be a high priority. Studies have found that although these couples are typically optimistic about their future together early in the relationship, most are no longer in a romantic relationship by the time the child is 5 years old.

AB  - Court-ordered shared physical and legal custody has led to greater numbers of couples that must coparent following divorce. We conducted a grounded theory study to examine resilience processes in postdivorce coparenting. Data were collected through in-depth interviews from 47 divorced mothers and fathers. The analysis revealed that successfully transitioning from married to divorced coparenting required intrapersonal changes (i.e., how participants thought and felt about their ex-partners) as well as behavioral changes (e.g., avoiding conflict). Parents who reported focusing on children, regulating their emotional responses, and choosing battles about time and money were more effective than those who had difficulty letting go of divorce anger or engaged in frequent conflicts. Implications for parent educators and clinicians are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research examines how the structure of children's time and space impacts parent–child relationship dynamics postdivorce. Our central research question is whether parent–child relationship quality and degree of perceived parental authority are associated with the amount of time spent with a parent and the type and amount of personalized space a child has at parents' homes after a divorce. We analyze the reports of 22 adolescents surveyed and interviewed in the northwestern United States in 2007. Most notably, the quality of personalized space for children, regardless of the amount of private space available, was significantly and positively related to parent–child relationship quality. Amount of time spent with a parent was also significantly and positively associated with parent–child relationship quality. Level of parental authority was partially positively associated with both quality of personalized space and amount of time spent with a parent. Our results confirm that these factors do indeed play...

AB  - Grounded in Learned Helplessness Theory, this study was designed to examine the role that explanatory styles serve as a potential moderator of the association between the perception of high interparental conflict and negative divorce outcomes, specifically depression and anxiety, among emerging adults whose parents previously divorced. The age of the participant at the time of the parents' divorce, as a moderator, was also explored. Living arrangements of the child were examined as a potential mediator. Last, protective factors were evaluated. Using a sample of 242 college students, hierarchical linear regression analyses were employed to assess the nature of the relationships between, and the mediating and moderating roles, of explanatory styles, living arrangements, age at the time of divorce, and protective factors. The overall findings suggest that permanence and pervasiveness significantly moderated the relationship between conflict and depression while pervasiveness supported moderation for anxiety. Contrary to expectations, personalization was not a significant moderator for either anxiety or depression. Surprisingly, among this sample, living arrangements nor the age at the time of divorce appear to significantly be associated with the outcomes of anxiety and depression. The most useful protective factors for emerging adults who experienced divorce as a child were social skills and social support for depression and social support for anxiety. Implications for future intervention to assist children experiencing divorce are provided.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this studywas to gain a deeper understanding of howchildren living in two homes after parents' separation experience their everyday lives. Design and Methods: An inductive qualitative design was chosen for the study using a hermeneutic phenomenological approach. Twelve children aged 10-13 years, and living in two homes, were interviewed. The data analysis used the four fundamental lifeworld existential dimensions: "lived body", "lived time", "lived space" and "lived human relations" as guidelines for reflections during the research process. Results: The overall understanding of the children's experience was that living in two homes was like living in two worlds. The children struggled with feelings of loss, loyalty and attachment. The children's experiences are described in four themes and nine sub themes. The themes are: Facing a changing home, Bridging new relations, Longing for continuity, Feeling loyalty. Conclusions: Parents' separation and living in two homes can be stressful for children. Children felt torn between their feelings of loyalty toward their parents, and their longing for calm and stability in their everyday life. A child-centered approach is therefore important to develop support focusing on the children's needs and perspectives after their parents' divorces. Practice Implications: A deeper understanding of children's experience of living in two homes provides nurses who care for children in the community or health care service with knowledge of children's need for support. Children whose parents have recently divorced, and children who live in families with parents experiencing high levels of conflict after the separation need special attention. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study examines the link between divorced nonresident fathers' proximity and children's long-run outcomes, using high-quality data from Norwegian population registers. We follow (from birth to young adulthood) each of 15,992 children born into married households in Norway in the years 1975-1979 whose parents divorced during his or her childhood. We observe the proximity of the child to his or her father in each year following the divorce and link proximity to educational and economic outcomes for the child in young adulthood, controlling for a wide range of observable characteristics of the parents and the child. Our results show that closer proximity to the father following a divorce has, on average, a modest negative association with offspring's outcomes in young adulthood. The negative associations are stronger among children of highly educated fathers. Complementary Norwegian survey data show that highly educated fathers report more post-divorce conflict with their ex-wives as well as more contact with their children (measured in terms of the number of nights that the child spends at the father's house). Consequently, the father's relocation to a more distant location following the divorce may shelter the child from disruptions in the structure of the child's life as they split time between households and/or from post-divorce interparental conflict.

AB  - Using nationally representative data on secondary school children in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, this study describes the relationships that children have with their fathers after divorce. Differences in the post-divorce relationship are explained in terms of demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, and contextual differences (between countries and between immigrants and natives). The focus is on living arrangements after divorce, the amount of contact with the father, and the perceived quality of the relationship. Many children have at least weekly contact with their father but one in six children never see their father at all. Fathers in high-status families are more highly involved in the child’s life after divorce than fathers in low-status families. A mother’s employment also has a positive effect on the post-divorce relationship with the father. Co-parenting is most common in Sweden. Post-divorce relationships are also strongest in Sweden and relatively weak in Germany. Immigrant children see their fathers less often after divorce than native children. In the second generation, children of mixed marriages in particular tend to have little contact with the father.

AB  - Contact between children and divorced fathers is often believed to strengthen the negative effect of interparental postdivorce conflict on children's well-being. Although this is a well-known hypothesis, there is surprisingly little evidence for it. This article examines the hypothesis using large-scale nationally representative data on secondary school students in the Netherlands. The hypothesis is tested using interactions of conflict with postdivorce contact and interactions of conflict with co-parenting. We find that children of divorced parents have more depressive symptoms than children of married parents. Interparental conflict after divorce increases children's depressive symptoms, while father-child contact has no effect. There is a significant interaction between interparental conflict and father-child contact: interparental conflict increases depression more when there is more contact between the father and the child. This is only observed for boys and not for girls. For girls, depression is increased when the quality of the tie to the father is poorer. Theoretical explanations are suggested in terms of exposure effects and conflicting loyalties.

AB  - Research has shown that many aspects of family functioning are directly and indirectly linked to children's social development. One important aspect of how families function is family structure. In this regard, families have undergone tremendous change over the last decades resulting in increased cohabitation and divorce. These types of families are believed to be more unstable than married families. Instability creates more stress that can be difficult for children to cope with resulting in increased behavioral problems. Although past studies have shown an association between union instability and children's externalizing problem behaviors (EPB), the mechanism by which this occurs is less understood. Using Family Systems Theory and data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study (n = 3,387), I examined whether family processes -- father and mother involvement, co-parenting support, and maternal responsiveness -- explained the association between union instability and children's EPB at 9 years. I also examined whether marital status and children's temperament moderated this association. Using measured variable path analysis, I found that only co-parenting support mediated the association between union instability and child EPB, and only for children whose mothers experienced a divorce (not a nonmarital separation), controlling for known covariates of children's EPB. The association between union instability and children's EPB through co-parenting and parenting was not moderated by child temperament. These findings suggest that co-parenting rather than parenting explains children's social adjustment when families undergo a divorce. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Although past studies have shown an association between union instability (i.e., change in family structure) and children's aggressive behaviors, the mechanism by which this occurs is less understood. This study (N = 3,387) examined whether father and mother involvement, coparenting support, and maternal responsiveness explained the association between union instability in early life and children's aggressive behaviors at 9 years, and whether relationship status moderated this association. Findings reveal that only coparenting support mediated this association and only for children whose mothers divorced (not for mothers who experienced a nonmarital separation), suggesting that when a divorce occurs, the relationship between partners (coparenting) is more important than the relationship with children (parenting) for children's social adjustment.

AB  - We know little about children who have two living nonresident biological parents. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examines the diverse living arrangements of U.S. adolescents in this situation, the kinds of relationships they have with each of their nonresident parents, and how these living arrangements are associated with adolescent well-being. Differences between these adolescents (n = 502) and those who have one nonresident biological parent (n = 4,746) are also examined. Results point to certain groups of adolescents with two nonresident parents who are at particular risk of exhibiting higher levels of behavior problems (those living alone or with an aunt and uncle) or who, alternatively, are faring comparatively better (those living with biological relative caregivers or two nonbiological parent figures).

AB  - Norsk familieliv har endret seg vesentlig siden Gullestads studie Kitchen Table Society (1984). Artikkelen beskriver hvordan kulturelle modeller for likestilt familie, fellesskap og tilhørighet blir forhandlet om gjennom det praktiske arbeidet med å skape et hjem for barn med delt bosted etter foreldrenes samlivsbrudd. Hjem viser til lokalitet, materialitet og temporært organisert samvær og hverdagsoppgaver. Hjem betyr også komplekse sosiale og emosjonelle familierelasjoner. Yngre barn forstår gjerne rettferdighet som likhet i betydning av å dele likt, og begrunner at de liker bo-ordningen med at dette er rettferdig for foreldrene. De er også opptatt av at foreldrene skal tenke på hva som er det beste for barnet, og at barnet skal ha medbestemmelse. Det er imidlertid vanskeligere å finne løsninger på disse normene i det daglige, gitt de ofte komplekse praktiske, emosjonelle og relasjonelle rammene de har for familielivet.

AB  - Shared residence, where children divide their time between parents after union dissolution, is becoming more common in several countries. This probably reflects more active fathering practices, but still, researchers and others worry that this arrangement is increasingly being used by parents with high levels of conflicts, with very young children and with limited economic resources. Using two Norwegian surveys from 2004 and 2012, we find that shared residence became more common among parents with high and low levels of conflicts, parents with younger and older children and among parents in all socioeconomic groups. Most parents are satisfied with this arrangement, but more knowledge about the children's perspective is obviously needed.

AB  - In many countries, dual residence is increasingly common for children when parents separate. This works well for many children, but opinions differ on whether or not it should be the norm. In analysing interviews with 35 nine‐ to 19‐year‐olds with dual‐residence experience in Norway, undertaken in 2018, we find clear traces of prevailing discourses in society. Claims of equality and fairness and claims of children's rights both emerge, the latter being particularly visible in the participants' recommendations to other children. Children value spending much time with both parents, but may still want more flexibility than their parents realise.

In the original article, an incorrect version of Figure 2 was included. The correction is given in the erratum.] Objective This article examines the determinants of father-child contact in Germany after divorce and separation, with a special emphasis on the role of legal child support. Background The contact separated fathers have with their children is a policy-relevant issue that has been intensively addressed in previous research for the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. For continental Europe, there has been far less research on this topic. This article investigated how fathers' union status at childbirth, custody arrangements, and past and present partnership dynamics affect the level of contact they had with their first-born child from a prior union. Method Data were used from Wave 2 (2009-2010) to Wave 8 (2015-2016) of the German Family Panel pairfam (www.pairfam.de). With a final sample size of 285 fathers, population average logistic models were estimated that examined nonresident fathers' probability of having frequent contact versus having little or no contact with their first-born children. Results Whether a nonresident father shared legal custody with the mother was a decisive factor in whether he had regular contact with his minor child, particularly if he was not living with the mother of the child at the time of delivery. There were strong interaction effects between having joint legal custody and the time since the parental separation. Joint legal custody did not have an immediate impact on father-child contact around the time of separation, but as time elapsed, men without joint legal custody were more likely to lose contact with their children than men with joint legal custody. Conclusion Joint legal custody may provide an institutional arrangement for separated parents to exercise their responsibility for the well-being of their children and thus be conducive to regular father-child contact.

AB  - Aims: Among children with separated parents, the arrangement of joint physical custody, i.e. children living equally much in both parents' homes, has increased substantially during the last decades in Sweden. To date, empirical research on the living conditions of this group is limited. This study analyses family type differences in turning to parents for emotional support and in subjective health among adolescents. The focus of the study is adolescents in joint physical custody, who are compared with those living with two original parents in the same household; those living (only) in a single-parent household; and those living (only) in a reconstituted family. Methods: The data come from the Stockholm School Survey of 2004, a total population survey of students in grade 9 (15-16 years) in Stockholm (n = 8,840). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions were conducted. Results: Turning to both parents about problems is most commonly reported by adolescents in intact families, followed by those in joint physical custody. Adolescents in non-traditional family types report worse subjective health than adolescents in intact families, but the difference is smaller for those in joint physical custody than for those living with a single parent. The slightly poorer health of adolescents in joint physical custody than those in intact families is not explained by their lower use of parents as a source of emotional support. Conclusions: The study suggests that joint physical custody is associated with a higher inclination to use parents as a source of emotional support and better subjective health than other post-divorce family types.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research has shown that coparenting is a vital family mechanism in predicting mental health in children and adolescents. Considering the increasing prevalence of marital dissolution in Western societies, the objective of this systematic review was to summarize the key results of empirical studies that tested the association between mental health of children and coparenting after marital dissolution. DATA SOURCE: The studies were obtained from three databases (PsycInfo, PubMed, and Web of Knowledge), published between January 2000 and October 2014. The titles, abstracts, and key words of the generated citations were independently reviewed by two investigators to consensually select the articles that met the inclusion criteria. Articles that used psychometrically valid tools to measure at least one mental health indicator and at least one dimension of coparenting in samples with divorced parents were included in the review. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 933 screened articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Significant positive associations were found between coparental conflict and behavioral problems and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization. Significant positive associations were also found between other specific dimensions of coparenting (coparental support, cooperation, and agreement), overall mental health, self-esteem, and academic performance. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated analysis of these studies suggests that coparenting is a key mechanism within the family system for the prediction of child mental health after marital dissolution, and thus, it is recommended that pediatricians, psychologists, and other health professionals consider coparenting as a psychosocial variable for children's mental health assessment and diagnosis.

AB  - Postseparation coparenting is decisive in the adjustment of families going through parental separation, which supports the necessity to gain a better understanding of the factors influencing this coparental relationship. This meta-analysis of 13 studies first examines the magnitude of the association between child custody and postseparation coparenting (conflict and cooperation). A second objective of this meta-analysis is to explore the influence of potential moderating variables, such as the time elapsed since the separation, the parent who has sole custody, the informant of the outcome variable, and the study's publication year. Findings show that parents with joint custody exhibit more cooperation than those with sole custody. However, it appears that having joint or sole custody has no influence on the level of conflict between two coparents. Interpretation of these results is quantified by the fact that the majority of the variables considered in terms of moderators act to modify the relationship between child custody arrangements and postseparation coparenting. This suggests that the development of less conflictual and more cooperative postseparation coparenting does not depend on a single factor, such as the type of custody arrangement, but on numerous interrelated factors. Future research and interventions should focus on the dynamics of the interaction of factors influencing postseparation coparenting. It is also important to take into account the limitations of such studies in the understanding of the subject, including limitations related to operational definitions of child custody arrangements. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (French) L'exercice conjoint du role parental est determinant dans l'adaptation des familles ayant subi la separation des parents, ce qui va en faveur de la necessite de mieux comprendre les facteurs influant sur la relation des parents. Cette meta-analyse de 13 etudes examine, dans un premier temps, l'ampleur du lien entre la garde de l'enfant et l'exercice conjoint du role parental apres la separation (conflit et cooperation). Dans un deuxieme temps, elle vise a determiner l'influence de variables potentiellement moderatrices, comme le temps depuis la separation, le parent ayant la garde exclusive, la source de la variante dependante et l'annee de la publication de l'etude. Les resultats montrent que les parents ayant la garde partagee temoignent de plus de cooperation que ceux ayant la garde exclusive. Toutefois, il semble que le fait d'avoir la garde unique ou partagee n'ait aucune incidence sur le niveau de conflit entre les deux parents. L'interpretation de ces resultats est quantifiee par le fait que la majorite des variables jugees moderatrices modifient la relation entre les dispositions relatives a la garde de l'enfant et l'exercice conjoint du role parental apres la separation. Cela suggere que le developpement d'une relation moins conflictuelle et plus cooperative apres la separation pour le partage du role parental ne depend pas d'un seul facteur, tel le type de garde convenu, mais plutot de nombreux facteurs interdependants. Les futures recherches et interventions pourraient s'attarder a la dynamique de l'interaction des facteurs influant sur l'exercice conjoint du role parental apres la separation. De plus, il est important de tenir compte des limites de telles recherches en ce qui a trait a la comprehension du sujet, dont les limites relatives aux definitions operationnelles des ententes au sujet de la garde des enfants.

AB  - I Norge, som i mange andre land, er det motstridende oppfatninger av om delt bosted er en god løsning etter samlivsbrudd. I dag bor omtrent ett av fire barn ikke sammen med begge foreldrene til daglig. Denne studien bidrar med forskningsbasert kunnskap om barns bo-ordninger etter foreldrenes samlivsbrudd. Vi har gjennomført tre delstudier: en barnestudie som får fram barn og unges erfaringer med delt bosted, en barnehagestudie hvor vi har undersøkt hvordan barnehagen involveres praktisk og på annen måte når barn har delt bosted, og, på basis av Undersøkelsen om samvær og bosted 2012, en analyse av hva som kjennetegner foreldre som bor forholdsvis nær hverandre og har delt bosted for barna, og av samarbeid og konfliktnivå blant foreldre med ulike bo-ordninger for barna.

N1  - publishedVersion,I Norge, som i mange andre land, er det motstridende oppfatninger av om delt bosted er en god løsning etter samlivsbrudd. I dag bor omtrent ett av fire barn ikke sammen med begge foreldrene til daglig. Denne studien bidrar med forskningsbasert kunnskap om barns bo-ordninger etter foreldrenes samlivsbrudd. Vi har gjennomført tre delstudier: en barnestudie som får fram barn og unges erfaringer med delt bosted, en barnehagestudie hvor vi har undersøkt hvordan barnehagen involveres praktisk og på annen måte når barn har delt bosted, og, på basis av Undersøkelsen om samvær og bosted 2012, en analyse av hva som kjennetegner foreldre som bor forholdsvis nær hverandre og har delt bosted for barna, og av samarbeid og konfliktnivå blant foreldre med ulike bo-ordninger for barna.

AB  - The role of co-parenting and the attention to the child’s needs on how children cope with separation and divorce has been confirmed by countless studies. This contribution will focus on the child’s reality in association with his developmental stage from infancy to adolescence. Specifically, the paper will focus on the child’s ability to understand what is happening, his representations, his experiences, his emotions and affections. This approach will help parents to reflect on the child’s view of what is happening in his life and in his parents’ life.

AB  - In particular, the 2006 changes to the Family Law Act 1975 were intended to bring the views, feelings and experiences of children into sharper focus. The present study explores the experience of parental separation for 623 adolescent children aged 12–18 years, whose parents separated after the introduction of the family law reforms in July 2006. The Australian Government Attorney-General’s Department (AGD) and Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) commissioned the study. With the backdrop of the family law reforms, the aim of the study was to describe how adolescent children view their experiences of parental separation. It is through the voices of these young people that we learn of their experiences of the process of parental separation and their own involvement in the decisions parents made about them following separation. Moreover, the findings in this study shed light on what adolescents wanted in their care-time arrangements, how they expressed their views, who they turned to for support, their relationships with parents and other family members, and their understanding of issues concerning parental conflict.

AB  - Children have long been excluded from the conversations surrounding their custody arrangements, a large decision that will greatly affect their well-being. Children are frequently uninvolved in court-mediated custody arrangements, as judges do not typically involve children in this decision until the end. Even when included in the process, their voices are not sought until a certain age or maturity level, and young children's voices are rarely ever sought. As such, this dissertation aimed to understand the experiences of six emerging adults who experienced dissatisfaction with their custody arrangements. This dissertation adopted a qualitative descriptive case study method and interviewed individuals age 18 through 27 who experienced parental separation or divorce under the age of 13 and who experienced dissatisfaction with their custody arrangements. Through the use of analytic memos and systematic coding of transcribed interviews, themes indicated that their dissatisfaction surrounded poor parent-child relationships after the separation, added responsibilities beyond the scope of their developmental age, a loss of stability, and a feeling that the family has been broken. Additionally, the participants felt that they struggled with the effects of their parents' separation into adulthood. The findings imply that potential solutions to addressing children's dissatisfaction with their custody arrangements should target the betterment of parent-child relationships post separation, as well as the collaboration between mental health professionals and family law professionals. Several recommendations are provided for parents, mental health professionals, and family law professionals. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - I denne rapporten presenteres en del resultater om fedre som ikke bor sammen med
barnas mor. Rapporten viser hvem av dem som har ingen eller liten kontakt med
barna sine. I tillegg blir det gitt en oversikt over andelen fedre som har mye kontakt
med barna.
Analysene er basert på Undersøkelsen om samvær og bosted 2012 gjennomført av
Statistisk sentralbyrå. Både foreldre som bor fast sammen med barnet, dvs. som har
samme registrerte adresse som barnet (her kalt bostedsforeldre) og foreldre som
ikke er registrert bosatt sammen med barnet (her kalt samværsforeldre) ble
intervjuet. I de fleste tilfellene er barnet registrert bosatt hos mor.
To prosent av samværsfedrene har, ifølge dem selv, ikke sett barnet siden
samlivsbruddet eller barnets fødsel. 12 prosent har ikke samvær med barnet en
vanlig måned. I mange tilfeller hvor det er lite samvær i det daglige, har fedrene
annen type kontakt med barna sine. Kun 3 prosent av samværsfedrene har verken
månedlig samvær med barna eller kontakt per telefon, sosiale media, epost o.l. siste
måned. Blant fedre som bor langt fra barna sine, har 29 prosent samvær i ferier,
men ikke månedlig samvær.
Basert på bostedsmødrenes svar får vi en noe høyere andel samværsfedre med lite
samvær enn svarene fra samværsfedrene selv gir. Ifølge mødrene har for eksempel
21 prosent av samværsfedrene ikke samvær med barna en vanlig måned.
Tilbøyeligheten til ikke å ha månedlig samvær med barnet og til ikke å ha samvær i
ferier er størst blant de fedrene som bor lengst unna barna sine, i de tilfellene
foreldrerelasjonen er preget av konflikt og i de tilfellene hvor mor og far ikke har
bodd sammen. Blant dem som har bodd sammen og som nå bor nær hverandre
(maksimum én times reisetid), er sjansen for lite samvær større blant foreldre med
grunnskole, dårlig helse, høy grad av konflikt og der mor tok seg mest av barna da
de bodde sammen enn blant foreldre med høyere utdanning, god helse, ingen
konflikt dem imellom og der far deltok minst på linje med mor i omsorgen for
barna.
Analysene av bostedsmødrenes svar tyder også på at det er større sjanse for lite
månedlig samvær og lite feriesamvær når foreldrene har ett barn felles enn når de
har flere, større når barnet er i alderen 15-17 år enn når det er under ti år, større
etter korte enn etter lange samliv.
Langt flere samværsfedre har mye samvær enn lite. Om lag halvparten av
samværsfedrene (52 prosent) har minst ti dager månedlig samvær. Om lag én av tre
samværsfedre (35 prosent) har vært sammen med barnet i minst fire ferier det siste
året, mens 22 prosent også har minst ti dager månedlig samvær i tillegg til fire
ferier sammen med barnet.
Bostedsmødrenes svar viser en noe lavere andel samværsfedre med mye
feriesamvær med barna sine enn svarene fra samværsfedrene selv gir.

AB  - Despite a recent shift in the allocation of parenting time arrangements following divorce, there is no clear consensus regarding the effects of shared parenting on children's adjustment in high-conflict families. We propose key questions and methodological options to increase the ability of results from well-designed empirical studies to inform practice and policy. We review 11 studies of relations between parenting time and parenting quality with children's adjustment in high-conflict divorced families. Despite heterogeneity of methods used across the studies, some tentative conclusions can be made based on findings of multiple studies. Higher levels of shared parenting were related to poorer child adjustment in samples with high conflict many years following the divorce, but typically not in samples that assessed conflict during the divorcing process or in the 2 or 3 years following the divorce. There is also evidence that the effects of shared parenting on child adjustment in the presence of high conflict differs by gender, and that high quality of parenting by at least 1 parent is associated with better child adjustment in high-conflict divorces. Implications for policy and practice are discussed as well as directions for research to strengthen the knowledge base to inform policy. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Children and particularly adolescents react differently to parental divorce. Referring to Minuchin's structural family therapy, this paper highlights the views of twenty adolescents on their relationships with their custodial parents, non-custodial parents and siblings, including the subsystems that emerged following parental divorce. Non-probability purposive sampling was employed to procure a sample of information-rich participants. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with adolescents, who shared valuable information pertinent to their feelings that inhibited some from having healthy relations with their parents and siblings. Suggestions for social work intervention in under-resourced areas such as the Waterberg District, Limpopo Province are presented. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The present study takes as a reference the change of Law 15/2005 in the Spanish Civil Code where the concept of shared custody was first introduced in Spain. The objective of this study is to check if a relationship exists between the results of investigations with an empirical base and the judicial decision when considering the effects that shared custody produces in children. With that objective in mind we carried out a qualitative analysis of the investigations related to joint custody consequences, both at national and international level. Then, after carrying out an analysis of the jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court from 2005 to 2015, we compared the results of the investigations with judges' decisions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Spanish) Se toma como referencia la modificacion de la Ley 15/2005 en el Codigo Civil espanol, donde se introduce el concepto de guarda y custodia compartida por primera vez en Espana. El objetivo del presente trabajo es establecer si existe una relacion entre los resultados de las investigaciones con base empirica y las decisiones judiciales acerca de los efectos que producen en menores la guarda y custodia compartidas. Para ello se ha realizado un analisis cualitativo de las investigaciones relativas a las consecuencias de la custodia compartida, tanto a nivel nacional como internacional. Posteriormente, se han comparado los resultados de las investigaciones con las decisiones de los magistrados, obtenidas tras realizar un analisis de la jurisprudencia de las sentencias del Tribunal Supremo desde el ano 2005 hasta el ano 2015.

AB  - This study produces a grounded theory of the process of communication with former partners for 30 men and women who share physical and legal custody of their children following divorce or separation. The formality of the custody arrangement was the core factor that influenced the ways in which study participants established and maintained boundaries regarding when, how, and what they communicated with their former partners. Other factors that played a role included the relationship with the former partner, the child, and the introduction of new partners. One cannot simply assume that because parents share physical and legal custody, they communicate with their former partners in a particular way; instead, the formality of the custody arrangement and the establishment of communication boundaries needs to be examined in order to understand how coparents communicate with their former partners.

AB  - The traditional notions of care appear to be connected to parents as caregivers and children as care-recipients. This article explores care in the context of post-divorce families to underline the need for re-evaluating the causal understanding of this concept. The data are drawn from a qualitative study investigating how Danish children aged 8-12 (and their parents) conduct their everyday lives with time-sharing arrangements as a result of parental divorce. Through empirical examples, different kinds of caring practices are highlighted to assert that care is a situated and reciprocal process between parents and children-a process of mutual caregiving and caretaking.

AB  - This article explores children's perspectives on post-divorce family life with time-sharing arrangements, focusing on the children's experiences of dilemmas and constraints, but also on new possibilities. In many ways, the everyday lives of children who commute between two households are double looped. These children have to be attentive to the routines, expectations and demands of each household. By assessing their conduct of everyday life, this article elucidates what children do to adapt to and make sense of this double-looped situation. This article examines how differences between households affect children's ways of understanding themselves and their family lives.

AB  - Tema for denne oppgaven er delt bosted for barn etter foreldres samlivsbrudd. Denne
bostedsløsningen har økt kraftig de siste femten år. Fra å gjelde en marginal gruppe, bodde i
2012 hvert fjerde av disse barna halve tiden hos hver av sine foreldre. I dag er tallet
sannsynligvis enda høyere. Det er de seinere årene gjort noe forskning på dette fenomenet, og
jeg tror det er viktig å få mest mulig kunnskap om hvordan det oppleves for barna selv som
vokser opp med to hjem. Er dette en løsning som er skreddersydd for foreldrene i et likestilt
samfunn, på bekostning av barna, eller er det også til barnas beste?
For å finne ut noe om dette, har jeg gjort kvalitative intervjuer av fire ungdommer mellom 19
og 21 år for å høre deres historier om hvordan delt bosted har vært for dem. Delt bosted blir
satt inn i en historisk kontekst, og lovens intensjon om barns beste blir diskutert. Jeg har valgt
å bruke teori rundt tilknytning og lojalitet, og sammen med tidligere forskning, utgjør dette
det teoretiske rammeverket rundt undersøkelsen. Mitt fokus har vært på ungdommenes
opplevelse av å vokse opp med to hjem, og hvordan de selv forstår sine erfaringer. Som
metode har jeg brukt tolkende fenomenologisk analyse (IPA).
Temaene som har pekt seg ut, er ungdommenes opplevelse av foreldresamarbeid og
fleksibilitet, deres opplevelse av innflytelse over egen hverdag, deres lojalitet og
rettferdighetsfølelse overfor foreldrene, deres opplevelse av foreldrenes etablering av nye
parforhold og deres opplevelse av ”hjem”. Det empiriske materialet blir presentert ved at jeg
først ”tegner et lite bilde” av hver av informantene for å kunne gi et innblikk i deres fortelling,
slik jeg forsto den. Deretter følger sitater fra intervjuene for å underbygge hvert tema, og dette
drøftes opp imot annen forskning og teori.
Ungommenes erfaringer med delt bosted er både positive og negative. De uttrykker to
konkurrerende behov: Behovet for å være mer i ro og behovet for å opprettholde god kontakt
med begge foreldrene. Mitt inntrykk er at de er villige til å ofre mye for å kunne ha et godt
forhold til begge. Jeg ser imidlertid en fare i den raske utviklingen av delt bosted som den
foretrukne bostedsløsningen etter samlivsbrudd, da denne ordningen krever spesielt mye og
tett samarbeid. Når flere velger det, kan dette prinsippet lett neglisjeres, og barna kan bli
skadelidende. I den forbindelse ser jeg et behov for tettere oppfølging fra hjelpeapparatet av
barn og familier som velger delt bosted etter samlivsbrudd i fremtiden.

N1  - Tema for denne oppgaven er delt bosted for barn etter foreldres samlivsbrudd. Denne bostedsløsningen har økt kraftig de siste femten år. Fra å gjelde en marginal gruppe, bodde i 2012 hvert fjerde av disse barna halve tiden hos hver av sine foreldre. I dag er tallet sannsynligvis enda høyere. Det er de seinere årene gjort noe forskning på dette fenomenet, og jeg tror det er viktig å få mest mulig kunnskap om hvordan det oppleves for barna selv som vokser opp med to hjem. Er dette en løsning som er skreddersydd for foreldrene i et likestilt samfunn, på bekostning av barna, eller er det også til barnas beste?

AB  - In recent years there has been much interest in the impacts on children, both positive and negative, of different patterns of parenting after separation, especially where the care of children is shared equally or substantially between both parents. This article summarises key findings from two recent Australian studies of outcomes for two potential risk groups: school-aged children living in separations characterised by high inter-parental conflict (Study 1), and infants and preschoolers in the general population of separated families (Study 2). Both studies were commissioned by the Australian Government Attorney-General's Department. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Children living in a shared-time parenting arrangement following separation (also known as joint physical custody or dual residence) spend equal or near-equal amounts of day and night time with each parent. Little data exist regarding developmental sequelae of such arrangements for infants. The current study examined a theoretically driven question: Are there associations between quantum of overnight stays away from a primary resident parent and the infant's settledness, or emotion regulation with that parent? Nationally representative parent report data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) were used. Three age bands were studied and three levels of overnight care contrasted. When parenting style, parental conflict and socio-economic factors were controlled for, greater number of shared overnight stays for the 0-1 year old and the 2-3 year old groups predicted some less settled and poorly regulated behaviours, but none for the 4-5 year old group. Limits of these data are discussed, including application to the individual case. Findings suggest emotional regulation within the primary infant-parent relationship is one useful index of infant adjustment to parenting time arrangements.

AB  - BACKGROUND This article provides an introduction to the Special Collection on "Separation, Divorce, and Residential Mobility in a Comparative Perspective." The Special Collection consists of six European case studies: Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Hungary, and the United Kingdom, and a cross-national study comparing Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. All studies focus on residential relocations or housing outcomes following separation. RESULTS Divorce and separation have a long-lasting impact on individuals' residential relocations and housing conditions. This influence is gendered - women are generally worse off than men - and varies by individuals' educational level, whether they have children, and who cares for the children following union dissolution. CONCLUSIONS Although the study countries are different regarding their welfare systems and housing markets, papers in the Special Collection report striking similarities in the housing and residential consequences of union dissolution across countries. Separation leads to a prolonged residential and housing instability for many individuals. CONTRIBUTION The studies contribute to the literature by focusing on the role of repartnering, child custody arrangements, the parental home, location continuity, country context, and gender for postseparation residential patterns and trajectories. Furthermore, this Special Collection contains the first analyses of the residential and housing patterns of separated men and women in Eastern and Southern Europe.

AB  - This study examined profiles of nonresidential father engagement (i.e., support to the adolescent, contact frequency, remarriage, relocation, and interparental conflict) with their adolescent children (N=156) 6 to 8 years following divorce and the prospective relation between these profiles and the psychosocial functioning of their offspring, 9 years later. Parental divorce occurred during late childhood to early adolescence; indicators of nonresidential father engagement were assessed during adolescence, and mental health problems and academic achievement of offspring were assessed 9 years later in young adulthood. Three profiles of father engagement were identified in our sample of mainly White, non-Hispanic divorced fathers: Moderate Involvement/Low Conflict, Low Involvement/Moderate Conflict, and High Involvement/High Conflict. Profiles differentially predicted offspring outcomes 9 years later when they were young adults, controlling for quality of the mother-adolescent relationship, mother's remarriage, mother's income, and gender, age, and offspring mental health problems in adolescence. Offspring of fathers characterized as Moderate Involvement/Low Conflict had the highest academic achievement and the lowest number of externalizing problems 9 years later compared to offspring whose fathers had profiles indicating either the highest or lowest levels of involvement but higher levels of conflict. Results indicate that greater paternal psychosocial support and more frequent father-adolescent contact do not outweigh the negative impact of interparental conflict on youth outcomes in the long term. Implications of findings for policy and intervention are discussed.

AB  - Shared parenting has been advocated to be a better arrangement for children than sole residence and access arrangements after parental separation. Although there is some research on this issue, studies have been restricted in their reliance on the reports of others. In this paper, we report on a study in Australia, in which children in each of these arrangements were compared with children in intact families on a range of adjustment measures and with each other in relation to their responses to their parents' separation, using both self- and parent-reporting. We found that there was little difference between children in the three family configurations, suggesting that shared parenting is not necessarily associated with better outcomes for the child. On other aspects of adjustment, the children in shared parenting and sole residence/access families did not differ. We also found that parents in all groups underestimated the emotional problems reported by children. In separated families, they also overestimated the children's desire for parents to re-unite. Finally, we found that parents in shared parenting families are more satisfied with their situation than are their children, and fathers are particularly so. The findings suggest that the promotion of shared parenting as the best post-separation family structure is contestable. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An increase in focus on the psychological, behavioral, and communicative influences on the wellbeing of children has led to changes in interventions during initial divorce court proceedings for co-parents. Key contributions of this paper comprise a deepening and refocusing on the theoretical foundations of divorce research by analyzing the link between communication style and custody arrangement, frequency of communication, and divorce experience; and by analyzing the connection between frequency of communication and use of technology. The results indicated that the use of technology did not influence the frequency of communication. Joint/shared custody and ongoing deliberation, as well as full (paternal) custody and ongoing deliberation, were significantly associated with protective communication. A protective communication style coincided with more frequent communication and a positive divorce experience; whereas, a laissez-faire communication style coincided with less frequent communication (e.g., both between co-parents and parents/children).

AB  - One of the most complex and compelling issues confronting policymakers, parents, and the family court system is what type of parenting plan is most beneficial for children after their parents' divorce. How much time should children live with each parent? An increasing number of children are living with each parent at least 35% of the time in shared residential parenting families: How are these children and their parents faring? In what ways, if any, do divorced parents who share the residential parenting differ from parents whose children live almost exclusively with their mother? How stable are shared residential parenting plans? By reviewing the existing studies on shared parenting families, these questions are addressed.

AB  - One of the most complex and compelling issues confronting policymakers, parents, and professionals involved in making custody decisions is this: What type of parenting plan is most beneficial for the children after their parents separate? More specifically, are the outcomes any better or worse for children who live with each parent at least 35% of the time compared to children who live primarily with their mother and spend less than 35% of the time living with their father? This article addresses this question by summarizing the 40 studies that have compared children in these two types of families during the past 25 years. Overall the children in shared parenting families had better outcomes on measures of emotional, behavioral, and psychological well-being, as well as better physical health and better relationships with their fathers and their mothers, benefits that remained even when there were high levels of conflict between their parents.

AB  - This article addresses 4 questions: First, how much weight should be given to parental conflict and the quality of the coparenting relationship in determining parenting time-specifically with respect to children's living at least 35% time with each parent in joint physical custody? Second, to what extent are low conflict and cooperative coparenting connected to better outcomes for children? Third, to what degree are children's outcomes linked to whether their parents take their custody disputes to court or have high legal conflict? Fourth, is joint physical custody associated with worse outcomes than sole physical custody for children whose parents have a conflicted, uncooperative coparenting relationship? Recent research does not support the idea that conflict-including high legal conflict-should rule out joint physical custody as the arrangement that best serves children's interests. Parents with joint physical custody do not generally have significantly less conflict or more cooperative relationships than parents with sole physical custody. Conflict and poor coparenting are not linked to worse outcomes for children in joint physical custody than in sole physical custody. The quality of the parent-child relationship is a better predictor than conflict of children's outcomes, with the exception of the most extreme forms of conflict to which some children are exposed. While continuing our efforts to improve parents' relationships with one another, we should become more invested in helping both parents maintain and strengthen their relationships with their children.

AB  - Is joint physical custody (JPC) linked to any better or worse outcomes for children than sole physical custody (SPC)? How are these outcomes affected by family income, parental conflict, and the quality of parent-child relationships? Compared to SPC children in 60 studies, JPC children had better outcomes on all measures in 34 studies, equal outcomes on some and better outcomes on other measures in 14 studies, equal outcomes on all measures in 6 studies, and worse outcomes on 1 measure, but equal or better on all other measures in 6 studies. In 25 studies, independent of family income, JPC children had better outcomes on all measures in 18 studies, equal on some and better on other measures in 4 studies, equal outcomes in 1 study, and worse outcomes on 1 but equal or better on other measures in 2 studies. In 19 studies, independent of parental conflict, JPC children had better outcomes on all measures in 9 studies, equal to better in 5 studies, equal in 2 studies, and worse outcomes on 1 but better outcomes on the other measures in 3 studies. In the 9 studies, independent of the quality of parent-child relationships, JPC children had better outcomes on all measures in 5 studies, equal or better outcomes on other measures in 2 studies, and worse outcomes on 1 of the measures in 2 studies. Independent of income, conflict, or the quality of children's relationships with their parents, JPC generally children had better outcomes on most or on all measures.

AB  - Is joint physical custody (JPC) linked to any better or worse outcomes for children than sole physical custody (SPC) after considering family income and parental conflict? In the 60 studies published in English in academic journals or in government reports, 34 studies found that JPC children had better outcomes on all of the measures of behavioral, emotional, physical, and academic well-being and relationships with parents and grandparents. In 14 studies, JPC children had equal outcomes on some measures and better outcomes on others compared to SPC children. In 6 studies JPC and SPC children were equal on all measures. In 6 studies, JPC children were worse on one of the measures than SPC children, but equal or better on all other measures. In the 25 studies that considered family income, JPC children had better outcomes on all measures in 18 studies, equal to better outcomes in 4 studies, equal outcomes in 1 study, and worse outcomes on one measure but equal or better outcomes on other measures in 2 studies. In the 19 studies that included parental conflict, JPC children had better outcomes on all measures in 9 studies, equal to better outcomes in 5 studies, equal outcomes in 2 studies, and worse outcomes on one measure but equal or better outcomes on other measures in 3 studies. In sum, independent of family income or parental conflict, JPC is generally linked to better outcomes for children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite widespread acknowledgment that "frequent, continuing, and meaningful" (Pruett & DiFonzo, 2014) time with both parents is beneficial for children from divorced or separated families, and that interparental conflict (IPC) is associated with increased child mental health problems, the joint effects of parenting time (PT), parenting quality (PQ), and IPC on children's mental health problems are less clear. The current study integrates two theoretical models in multiple mediator analyses to test indirect effects of mothers' and fathers' PQ and IPC to explain the association between PT and children's mental health problems within the same model. Participants were children aged 9-18 years (N = 141) who had one or both parents participate in a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of a court-based prevention program for high-conflict divorcing or separating families. Data were collected at pretest and 9-month follow-up. Analyses revealed an indirect effect in which fathers' PQ mediated the association between PT and child internalizing problems both concurrently and 9 months later. There were no significant indirect effects involving IPC. Analyses indicated a significant quadratic relation between PT and fathers' PQ, suggesting that although more PT is associated with better father-child relationships, there is a point beyond which more time is not related to a better relationship. We discuss the study findings, research limitations, and implications for public policy.

AB  - This study examined the experience of children raised in joint custody following divorce and identified strategies for empathic, responsive co-parenting within a refashioned family design. Retrospective accounts of seven adults reared in joint custody, supplemented by the accounts of seven parents, representing seven families, were gathered via semi-structured interviews; qualitative coding was employed to identify emotional and practical struggles that are commonly found, but are often insufficiently addressed. Results are supplemented with four extensive case studies, providing close analysis of broad themes emergent in the research. Children of divorce suffer losses at both the environmental and the object-relational level. The environmental losses are more easily observed: loss of familial intactness, loss of daily contact with each parent, and loss of contact with both parents together, referenced here as the 'marital-parental dyad.' Loss and disruption at the representational level is more difficult to recognize. When parents divorce, and as children move repeatedly between parental homes in joint custody, what becomes significantly compromised is the 'parental-dyadic object': an internalization of parents as a joined and cooperative entity, providing important parental scaffolding and definition at a primary object relational level. Findings suggest that parents might ease loss reactions in children through the establishment of a post-divorce cooperative parental relationship that emphasizes the aspect of the marital-parental relationship that is not dissolved with the marriage. In addition to a literature review from psychoanalysis and from contemporary writings on divorce, theories of immigration and biculturalism were reviewed to consider movement from the 'old world' of the intact family to the 'new world' of the family of divorce, and the subsequent back-and-forth movement between the different 'cultures' of parental homes. Much of the existing literature on divorce and joint custody highlights the problem of ongoing post-marital conflict. In this study, overt conflict was less evident than passive expressions of anger between parents, via disparagement and avoidance of contact, which interfered with parents' capacity to provide post-divorce cooperative co-parenting and left children susceptible to loyalty binds and competing identifications, impeding their sense of broad family belonging. Recommendations for moving away from conflict, beyond civility, and toward cooperative co-parenting are outlined. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - ABSTRACT The main goal of this study is to perform a critical literature review of empirical research that measures the effects of joint physical custody (JPC) on children's and parents' wellbeing from a sociological perspective. Its focus is Spain in the scope of the Second Demographic Transition (SDT). The studies reviewed show no consensus on terminology that best expresses the condition of JPC, definition of the concept of JPC, or what it is meant by best interest of the child (BIC). A systematic search was performed to locate publications on Spain from 2015-2020. The review shows that the vast majority of JPC resolutions are granted to a specific family profile: highly educated parents who have experienced a low level of family conflict. The review of theoretical antecedents raises the following unanswered questions: Is SDT culture determining the progress of the legal system? Does existing law benefit a specific segment of the parent population? Is a correspondence occurring between family change, jurisprudence, and family and economic policies that benefits children and parents? This study highlights the need for consensus in defining the concepts of JPC and BIC, as well as the measures and methodology to be applied to analyze them.

AB  - Reports an error in "Reforming relocation law: An evidence-based approach" by Patrick Parkinson and Judy Cashmore (Family Court Review, 2015[Jan], Vol 53[1], 23-39). In the original article, there are some textual errors. Corrections are presented. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2015-02311-004). In recent years, there has been much discussion within international for a about the need for a greater consensus on how to approach relocation cases. Empirical research on the lived experience of parents and children who have been through relocation disputes has an important role to play in providing an evidence base for decisions on policy. In this article, we summarize the findings of a 5-year prospective longitudinal study of relocation disputes in Australia and make recommendations in the light of this and other research evidence concerning a new approach to relocation law. We argue that there should be no presumptions. Nonetheless there is an appropriate place for legislative or appellate guidance on how to approach these disputes. "Good faith" should be irrelevant to decision making, and children should not be placed in the center of the conflict. The adjudication of relocation disputes should be on the basis of asking three questions: First, how close is the relationship between the nonresident parent and the child and how important is that relationship developmentally to the child? Second, if the relocation is to be permitted, how viable are the proposals for contact with the nonresident parent? Third, if the relationship between the child and the nonresident parent is developmentally important to the child and is likely to be diminished if the move is allowed, then (a) what are the viable alternatives to the parents living a long distance apart? and (b) is a move with the primary caregiver the least detrimental alternative?

AB  - Pendant longtemps, la plupart des enfants qui vivaient la séparation de leurs parents allaient habiter avec leur mère. Les parents séparés sont toutefois de plus en plus nombreux à partager les responsabilités parentales de façon plus équitable, notamment par la garde partagée (ou double résidence, ou résidence alternée). Afin d'identifier les caractéristiques des familles qui influencent la manière dont les ex-conjoints partageront le temps parental au moment de la rupture, nous avons eu recours aux données de l'Étude longitudinale sur le développement des enfants du Québec (ÉLDEQ). Dans cette cohorte représentative des enfants nés au Québec en 1997-1998, nous trouvons que l'établissement d'une double résidence pour les enfants est fortement associé à la participation au marché du travail des mères et au niveau de scolarité des pères. Le climat entourant la séparation et le sentiment d'efficacité parentale des pères jouent aussi un rôle important.Alternate abstract:For a long time, most children who witnessed their parents' separation went to live with their mother. However, an increasing proportion of separated parents share parental responsibilities more equitably, including through shared or joint physical custody (or dual residence). In order to identify the characteristics of families that influence how former spouses and partners share parental time at union dissolution, we used data from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD). In this representative cohort of children born in the province of Quebec in 1997-1998, we found that the establishment of dual residence for children was strongly associated with the labour force participation of mothers and the level of education of fathers. The climate surrounding separation and fathers' sense of parental effectiveness also played an important role.Alternate abstract:Durante mucho tiempo, la mayoría de los niños que atravesaban por el proceso de separación de sus padres y madres, vivían con su madre. A pesar de ello, los padres y las madres separadas – que cada vez son más numerosos – están más dispuestos a compartir sus responsabilidades parentales de manera más equitativa, principalmente a través de la tenencia compartida (o bajo la modalidad de doble residencia o de residencia alternada). Con el fin de identificar las características de las familias y la manera como los ex integrantes de la pareja van a compartir el tiempo parental al momento de la ruptura, vamos a utilizar los datos estadísticos provenientes del Estudio longitudinal sobre el desarrollo de los niños en la Provincia de Quebec (ÉLDEQ). En la cohorte representativa de los niños nacidos entre los años 1997-1998 en la Provincia de Quebec, encontramos que el establecimiento de una doble residencia para los niños está fuertemente asociado a la participación en el mercado del trabajo de las madres y al nivel de educación de los padres. También juega un rol importante el clima que rodea a la separación y el sentimiento de eficacia parental de los padres y las madres.

AB  - The current study's researcher focused on the experiences of individuals in stepfamilies or blended families on days of transition. The main research question was: are different processes involved when moving from a custodial parent's home to a noncustodial parent's home and vice-versa? These interviews included questions for parents in a blended family. Questions included: general questions, transitional day specific questions, cognitive awareness, reality, learning (growing) influences from the other parents (bio/step), and influences from extended family members. By gaining a more in-depth understanding of transitional days in stepfamilies, immediate assistance may be provided to families who are in various stages of stepfamily/blended family formation. Lastly, useful approaches to other stepfamilies and future stepfamilies were researched in order to assist in greater understanding of change in homeostasis of the families (expectations).

AB  - Objective: This article examines whether paternity leave influences father involvement among nonresident fathers, if associations differ by coresidential status, and whether leave is a stronger predictor of nonresident father involvement than other indicators of father identity or interest. Background: Fathering promotes child development, yet many children are born to unmarried parents and do not live with their fathers. Paternity leave may increase fathering among nonresident fathers, but extant research has largely overlooked these fathers. Method: Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N~2,000), a longitudinal birth cohort of largely low-income families, this study examines the link between paternity leave and parenting using regression analyses. Results: Leave-taking was associated with higher reports of engagement for both coresident and nonresident fathers, but for maternal reports of trust, coparenting, and responsibility, the positive associations with leave-taking were concentrated among nonresident fathers. Nonresident fathers who took leave were more likely to provide in-kind child support but not monetary support. Although leave, prenatal involvement, and being at the birth were all associated with greater involvement among nonresident fathers, mothers' reports of fathering were more strongly influenced by prenatal involvement and being at the hospital for the birth than leave. Conclusion: Leave-taking is associated with maternal reports of trust, coparenting, and responsibility for nonresident fathers but not coresident fathers. Leave and prenatal involvement predict nonresident father involvement. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In 2009 the Dutch legislator introduced a law that sought to encourage shared residence. We summarize key findings on shared residence from prior work in the Netherlands, and present new data. Previous research showed that shared residence has increased steadily in recent decades. Our recent estimates revealed that shared residence increased from nearly 20% in 2008 (prereform) to 28% in 2010 (postreform). Official court data showed a decline again to a little over 20% in 2013. We also found shared residence to be less a stable arrangement than mother or father residence. Consistent with earlier studies, parents with shared residence were found to be well-resourced parents with little conflict and few personal problems. These parents were also more likely to maintain this arrangement, but the instability of shared residence also appeared to be related to practical circumstances and to children's needs. Earlier findings on the consequences of shared residence for child and parent well-being were mixed, but suggest positive effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Frequent parent-child contact after divorce is generally assumed to be in children's best interests, but findings are mixed. This study extends the small body of research about the conditions under which parent-child contact is more beneficial or less beneficial by examining the role of predivorce parental involvement. It is argued that the more a parent was involved in child rearing in the past, the more important postdivorce parent-child contact is for child well-being. Data from the Netherlands (N = 3,694) show that when children live with the parent who was not the primary caretaker, child well-being is lower. Similarly, the more the father used to be involved in child rearing, the more beneficial nonresident father-child contact is for children. These findings suggest that it is not so much the frequency of contact per se that matters for child well-being but, rather, the extent to which postdivorce residence arrangements reflect predivorce parenting arrangements.

AB  - This study examined the association between postdivorce coparenting patterns and adolescent internalizing and externalizing behavior. Children after parental divorce increasingly grow up in shared residence arrangements, making postdivorce coparenting much more pertinent. The Coparenting Behavior Questionnaire was used to investigate the perceptions of 251 Dutch adolescents regarding postdivorce coparenting behaviors. Latent class analysis was used to identify coparenting patterns, and associations with adolescent outcomes were examined. Four distinct postdivorce coparenting patterns were identified: cooperative, negatively engaged, negatively disengaged, and average. Adolescents of parents with a cooperative pattern reported the least amount of internalizing and externalizing problems, whereas adolescents with negatively engaged parents reported the most internalizing problems. In line with family systems theory, interactions in the coparental subsystem are associated with adolescent adjustment and can therefore be viewed as both a risk and protective factor.

AB  - Almost half of first marriages end in divorce, which in turn may produce joint physical custody arrangements. Seen by many states to be in the best interest of the child, joint physical custody is increasingly common. Yet much is unknown about its consequences for children. This article considers how joint physical custody arrangements affect children's neighborhood friendships, an important component of child well-being because of their contributions to social and cognitive development. Thirteen parents and 17 children (aged 5-11) in 10 families, selected via convenience and snowball sampling, participated in semistructured interviews. The findings suggest that joint physical custody arrangements do not imperil children's neighborhood friendships; indeed, most children and parents interviewed voiced contentment in this area.

AB  - As a distinct construct from both marital relationship and parent-child relationship, coparenting refers primarily to the extent to which parents experience joint responsibility for children’s well-being, are able to cooperate and coordinate in the decisions regarding their children, and trust each other. These aspects concern visible behaviors and interactions between parents, together with their perceptions. In the past decades, a growing number of studies have demonstrated the influence of coparenting on marital and parent-child relationships, and on children’s psychosocial adjustment, from early toddlerhood through adolescence. Coparenting and its effects have been mostly explored among divorced parents or intact families separately. The present study was aimed at comparing perceptions of coparenting in divorced and married parents (100 divorced parents and 85 married parents), both fathers and mothers, and assessing the relation between coparenting and school-age and adolescent children’s psychosocial adjustment. Results showed that divorced parents, especially fathers, perceived a lower level of coparenting. Moreover, children’s adjustment were related to coparenting only in the group of divorced parents.

AB  - Family courts now encourage both parents to maintain contact with their children following separation/divorce, believing this is in the child's best interest. We use geographical distance between non-resident parents and their children to test how such distance is related to educational and behavioral outcomes within a population sample of children from nonnuclear families in Denmark. As this distance is a choice, non-resident parents may choose where to live in part based on expected child outcomes; results that fail to take endogeneity into account will be biased. We use instrumental variable techniques to control for this potential endogeneity. The results indicate educational outcomes are somewhat better for all and behavioral outcomes are at least no worse for girls who live at a greater distance from their non-resident parent. Failing to control for endogeneity seems to bias the results for behavioral outcomes in favor of more proximate parents. Thus, policy efforts to keep separated parents geographically closer for the sake of their children may in fact not be advantageous.

AB  - Divorce is highly prevalent in the United States with approximately 3.2 out of every 1,000 marriages ending in divorce each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). Divorce impacts both children and parents. Previous research suggests that children demonstrate better adjustment when their parents develop and maintain a cooperative co-parenting relationship (Beckmeyer, Coleman, & Ganong, 2014). Hostile Attribution Bias is the tendency to interpret the intention of others as hostile when social contextual cues are ambiguous (Epps & Kendall, 1995). It is believed that a hostile attribution bias will reduce quality of co-parenting, but that this relation will be moderated by forgiveness. The purpose of this study was to explore the relation in parents among empathy, forgiveness, and hostile attribution bias that contributes to effective co-parenting and resulting child outcomes, and examine the differences that dispositional forgiveness or forgiveness of an ex-spouse contribute to these relations. The inclusion criteria for participants was being divorced between 1 and 7 years and having at least one child under the age of 18. Participants filled out self-report measures on a common source survey system assessing for level of forgiveness, empathy, post-divorce quality of co-parenting, and child adjustment. Hostile attribution bias was measured with vignettes (both ambiguous and hostile) depicting email scenarios that are relevant to co-parenting. A total of 126 participants were surveyed. It was hypothesized that parents who rate themselves as higher in forgiveness would be more effective co-parents. It was also expected that parents who rate themselves higher in forgiveness would have children with lower internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Forgiveness was predicted to moderate the relation between a hostile attribution bias and child behavior as well as the relation between hostile attribution bias and co-parenting. Finally, empathy was predicted to moderate the relation between forgiveness and hostile attribution bias, such that higher levels of empathy would foster forgiveness. Pearson correlations and hierarchical regression with moderation analyses were used to test these hypotheses. Parents who rated themselves as having more dispositional forgiveness as well as more forgiveness of their ex-spouses were found to have significantly better quality of co-parenting. Level of forgiveness was not found to be related to interpreting ambiguous vignettes as less hostile nor did it moderate the relation between a hostile attribution bias and child behavior or hostile attribution bias and quality of co-parenting. Parents who rated themselves as more empathetic did interpret closed ended questions as less hostile, but not opened ended. In addition, empathy was not found to moderate the relation between forgiveness and a hostile attribution bias for open ended questions measuring hostility, however, it was found to moderate the relation for closed ended questions. Clinical implications, limitations of the present study, and directions for future research were discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mental health consequences related to divorce have been documented, but might be caused by concomitant factors such as conflicts and loss of parental contact (PC). We investigated these relationships and mental health among adolescents. The study was based on data from four cross-sectional surveys carried out between 1997 and 2009 among tertiary school students in Frde, Norway. We established two groups according to divorce experience (DE) with or without loss of PC. Frequencies of DEs were calculated with 95 confidence intervals. The group with no DE was used as reference group in all the analyses. The divorce rate increased by 34 (6.8 absolute increase) between 1997 and 2009, but no sign of attenuated effects on emotional health was observed. Mental complaints were not attenuated as time since divorce increased. A majority of those losing contact with parents had no contact with their fathers. The study revealed only a modest increase of health complaints if PC was preserved, but a marked increase when the adolescents experienced loss of PC following the divorce. Interaction analyses showed no gender differences, and parental support and confidence in parent(s) did not mediate the associations between divorce and distress. Emotional distress after divorce is not attenuated as divorce prevalence increases, but the deleterious effects of divorce on the well-being of adolescents seem to be confined to those experiencing a concomitant loss of PC. Efforts aiming at reducing parental hostility and improving mutual parental responsibility and care therefore seem important.

AB  - This study explored the lived experience of security and contentment, and their absence, for latency-aged children (aged 8-12) living in shared-time parenting arrangements following their parents' separation. A descriptive phenomenological methodology was utilized (Giorgi, 1985,2009; Giorgi & Giorgi, 2003,2008). Sixteen children living in shared-time were interviewed about their experiences of two phenomena: "feeling secure and content living in shared-time" and "not feeling secure and content living in shared-time." The eight richest protocols were selected for analysis. The two resultant general structures and their core constituents are presented, and individual variations discussed. Central to each phenomenon is the parent/s' capacity, or incapacity, to create and sustain a physical and emotional space in which the child feels secure and held in the mind, feels the arrangements are responsive to their needs, feels free to access the "absent" parent, and experiences integration between the two parental homes. Implications for phenomenological human science research are considered, including the use of descriptive phenomenology with children. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Among the research, practice and socio-legal commentary on the substantial sharing of parenting time after separation, children's voices about their experiences remain overwhelmingly silent. This article draws on findings of a descriptive phenomenological study which investigated Australian school-aged (8- to 12-year-old) children's descriptions of two binary phenomena: security and contentment in shared time arrangements, and the absence of security and contentment in shared time parenting. Specifically, this article focuses on exploring parental behaviours and interactions recognised by children as sources of security in shared time lifestyles, through happy and needy times. Central to this is the juxtaposition of the child's experience of security and shared enjoyment with the present parent, against the absence of security emanating from unresolved longing for the 'absent' parent. The article provides an empirically derived formulation of children's advice to parents about shared time parenting, with relevance for family law related parent education forums.

Methods: Qualitative synthesis included a systematic and transparent method for retrieval, screening, and analysing qualitative studies. The inclusion criteria accepted studies that were: qualitative in design; included children as participants in shared care parenting time post-separation.
Results: Ten qualitative studies in six different countries with 466 children and young adults were included in the final analysis. Children’s experiences of shared care parenting post separation were mixed and varied depending on contextual factors related to their relationship with both parents, as well the quality of these relationships and the flexibility/rigidity of the parenting arrangement.
Implications: Hearing from children and young adults directly helps to move the shared care debate away from binary arguments about sole versus shared care based on parents’ rights and advocacy views.

AB  - The current study examined the associations between child mental health problems and the quality of maternal and paternal parenting, and how these associations were moderated by three contextual factors: quality of parenting by the other parent, interparental conflict, and the number of overnights parents had with the child. Data for the current study came from a sample of divorcing families who are in high legal conflict over developing or maintaining a parenting plan following divorce. Analyses revealed that the associations between child mental health problems and positive maternal and paternal parenting were moderated by the quality of parenting provided by the other parent and by the number of overnights children spent with parents, but not by the level of interparental conflict. When parenting by the other parent and number of overnights were considered together in the same model, only number of overnights moderated the relations between parenting and child-behavior problems. The results support the proposition that the well-being of children in high-conflict divorcing families is better when they spend adequate time with at least one parent who provides high-quality parenting.

AB  - Here we consider interpersonal experience in schizophrenia, melancholia, and mania. Our goal is to improve understanding of similarities and differences in how other people can be experienced in these disorders, through a review of first-person accounts and case examples and of contemporary and classic literature on the phenomenology of these disorders. We adopt a tripartite/dialectical structure: first we explore main differences as traditionally described; next we consider how the disorders may resemble each other; finally we discuss more subtle but perhaps foundational ways in which the phenomenology of these disorders may nonetheless be differentiated. These involve disruptions of common sense and conventionality, abnormalities of empathy, distinct forms of paranoia and the sense of personal centrality, and altered perceptions of intentionality, deadness, and artificiality. We end by considering some neurocognitive research relevant to these abnormal forms of subjectivity, including work on theory of mind, experience of human movement, and perception of faces.

AB  - Court-ordered expert evaluations following a divorce or separation frequently pertain to visiting rights between children and the parent who is assigned custody. Currently, there are only a very limited number of studies with a focus on the development of visiting arrangements over time. The aim of this study was to analyze the long-term progress of child-visiting arrangements after court decisions based on an expert evaluation. In the present study 91 expert evaluations that were made by the Department of Psychiatry, Psychosomatics, and Psychotherapy in children and adolescents, University Hospital of Tubingen, between 2011 and 2014 were analyzed. Parental questionnaires on current visiting arrangements following the court decisions were evaluated in 2017. A total of 65 questionnaires were sent to parents and 55 questionnaires pertaining to 36 separated families were returned. The questionnaires were analyzed using empirical social research methods. In 83.3% of cases (n = 36) the child lived with the mother. Results showed that the parents assigned with custody of the children were more satisfied with the arrangements and wished no changes. Further, they favored less contact between the child and the other parent. The visiting parents were less satisfied with the arrangements and wished to have more contact with the children. The majority of mothers and fathers rated the parental cooperation as not good and insufficient. In seven cases (18.4%) the expert evaluation recommended a temporary exclusion of contact. In none of these cases was the contact resumed. In 31 cases the expert evaluation recommended a child arrangement order. In 15 of the 31 cases (48.4 %), however, there was no contact between the child and the non-resident parent at the time of the questionnaire survey. Prior to the evaluation by the experts there was no contact in 13 of the 31 cases (41.9 %). The findings confirm that in this sample the long-term implementation of a child arrangement order recommended by an expert opinion or a family court decision was not successful. In almost every second case the child had no contact with the non-resident parent even though visiting arrangement orders were recommended. Our results underline that in high-conflict families, sufficient instruments still have to be developed to secure the daily life implementation of court decisions on visitation rights. Another key finding of the study is that due to concerns about data protection, not all theoretically possible information was available. In order to at least partially avoid these data protection problems, a survey of children and adolescents would have to be carried out when they are of legal age. Such a study would also have the great advantage of being able to better assess the importance of recommendations or corresponding decisions with regard to the further development or life of the children and young people concerned. The highly selective sample of this survey should be noted, and, therefore, the results are not generalizable. Further investigations are necessary and perhaps a way to involve the children in the process of optimization can be found. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sammendrag I denne masteroppgaven har jeg hatt til hensikt å se nærmere på og utdype barns budskap til foreldre, i meklingssaker hvor barnevernet er involvert. Datamateriale for oppgaven var allerede samlet inn, i forbindelse med forskningsprosjektet ”Høring av barn i mekling” (HBIM). Av det totale materiale, består mitt utvalg av 28 meklingssaker, med budskap fra til sammen 43 barn. Budskapene til barna er frembragt i samtale mellom barn og mekler, gjennom bruk av meklingsmodellen ”Barn i mekling” (BIM). Synet på barn som selvstendig individ med rett til egne tanker og meninger er med på å løfte debatten om barn og barns rettigheter. Forholdet mellom barns rett til beskyttelse, og barns rett til å bli hørt, kommer tydelig frem ved barns deltakelse i mekling. Oppgaven tar for seg hvordan barnets perspektiv, kommer til uttrykk gjennom barnets deltakelse. En tydelig tendens i materialet er at samtlige av barna vil delta, når de får mulighet til det. Samtidig vitner budskapene om barn som sliter med foreldrenes konflikter og samtlige av barna er opptatt av og sier noe om bosted og samværsordning. Dette er et viktig resultat, da spørsmål om bosted ikke er noe barna blir spurt om. Stikkord: Mekling, Barns rettigheter, Budskap fra barn, barns beste ; Abstract The focus of this master’s thesis has been to closer examine and elaborate children’s messages to their parents in a mediation process where the Child Services are involved. The data used was already collected for the research project ”Høring av barn i mekling” (HBIM). Of the total research material, my selection contains 28 mediation cases with information from 43 children in total. The messages from the children have been brought forward in conversations between the child and the mediator, through the use of the mediator model called ”Barn i mekling” (BIM). Viewing children as independent individuals with the right of having their own thoughts and opinions, helps strengthening the debate about children and their rights. The link between children’s right to protection and children’s rights of being heard is clearly stated when children participate in a mediation process. This thesis delves deeper into how the child’s perspective is expressed through the child’s own participation. Through the data we see a clear trend that if given the choice, all children wish to participate. The material also shows that the children are torn between the conflicts of their parents, and that all of the children are concerned with, and express thoughts about where they wish to live. This is an important result as children are not usually involved in the process of deciding where to live. Key words: Mediation, Children’s rights, Messages from children, Participation

AB  - The occurrence of arrangements within which the children keep in close contact with both parents after their parents split up has strongly risen. It is well known that spatial proximity between the parental homes facilitates multi-locality, but it does not determine it. However, there is a shortage of analyses going beyond the opportunity structure effect. Hence, our article, on the one hand, tries to identify factors promoting multi-local everyday life as well as mediating the negative correlation between spatial distance and multi-local life. On the other hand, we ask how residential distance moderates the relation between multi-locality and these characteristics. Referring to family economics, the theory of resources, and time-geographical considerations regressions using the DJI-survey AID:A show that the opportunity structure thesis possesses high explanatory power, but does not go far enough. Shared legal custody, higher maternal education, a higher age of the children at parental separation as well as a young current age are strongly positively correlated with multi-locality, whereas low economic resources are negatively correlated. Mediating effects could not be detected. Spatial distance, however, partially moderates the meaning of diverse factors for multi-locality. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The article presents the final part of an Icelandic research project on parents and children of divorce, focusing on grown-up children’s experiences of equal time-sharing arrangements, ETSA, after their parents’ divorce. It consists of a quantitative analysis of firstly a nationally representative sample mapping the frequency and experience of 18–59 years old individuals of ETSA after parents’ divorce, and secondly a qualitative analysis of 16 long interviews with 16 children of divorce reflecting on their experiences. Both analyses indicate different experiences of this type of arrangement. The reality of the arrangement in practice is that parents chose the arrangement on the basis of their own preferences rather than a court imposing it or because the generally accepted core conditions for a positive outcome for children were in place. These negative experiences of ETSA are discussed in further detail and the need for law reform and service improvement is considered.

AB  - In many Western countries, shared-time parenting after separation is emerging as a new family form. This development has been accompanied by an intensification of research into risks and benefits for children. Separated parents with shared-time arrangements tend to report that their children are doing well and that they and their children like the arrangements, but shared parenting itself does not appear to cause this desirable situation. Instead, recent studies continue to suggest that well-functioning families are more likely to select into shared-time parenting. Consistent with many early US studies, the latest international research suggests that children can benefit from shared-time arrangements postseparation. But these arrangements can also involve risks for children—particularly when children are very young, the arrangements are inflexible and unresponsive to the needs of the child, there is uncontrolled parental conflict, mothers report ongoing safety concerns, or there is some combination of these factors. In this chapter we (a) discuss the conceptual, measurement and sampling issues that continue to make shared-time research an imperfect science, (b) summarize key findings from the latest studies of shared-time arrangements examining child outcomes, (b) set out the strengths and limitations of each study, and (c) suggest five broad domains to consider in determining whether shared-time arrangements will benefit children or put them at risk.

AB  - This Special Issue takes an outward-looking comparative approach to shared-time parenting trends around the world. Leading international researchers on post separation patterns of parenting were invited to submit their latest work. In summary, this Special Issue highlights the complex and heterogeneous nature of contemporary shared-time parenting research and the diverse cultural, legislative, and policy contexts underpinning the studies and accompanying commentary. Research must be responsive to context. But heterogeneity in research methods and context makes it difficult to draw firm global conclusions or recommendations. Tempting though it might be for practitioners and decision makers hard pressed for guidance in individual cases, these articles suggest that no single finding or study should ever become the default guide to policy or practice in such a complex and evolving area.

AB  - Shared residence after divorce is rising in most Western countries and legally recommended by law in Belgium since 2006. Living with both parents after divorce is assumed to increase children's well-being, through a better parent-child relationship, but may also be stressful, as children live in 2 different family settings. In this study, we investigate whether the association between the residential arrangement of adolescents and 3 measures of subjective well-being (depressive feelings, life satisfaction, and self-esteem) is moderated by the Big Five personality factors. The sample is selected from the national representative Divorce in Flanders study and contains information about 506 children from divorced parents between 14- and 21-years-old. Our findings indicated a consistent pattern of interactions between conscientiousness and joint physical custody for 2 of the 3 subjective well-being indicators. The specific demands of this residential arrangement (making frequent transitions, living at 2 places, adjustment to 2 different lifestyles, etc.) may interfere with the nature of conscientious adolescents: being organized, ordered, and planful. Our results showed support for a Person x Environment interaction, and demonstrate the need for considering the individual characteristics of the child when settling postdivorce residential arrangements.

AB  - The frequency of contact with fathers and mothers and the amount of parental support for boys and girls is an important issue after divorce, from emotional, legal, and empirical points of view. In the Netherlands between 1998 and 2008, joint physical custody after divorce (when children actually have shared residences) has increased from 5% to 16%. It is therefore interesting to compare the effects growing up in the following different kinds of families actually has on children: (a) mother families with low contact frequency with the father; (b) mother families with high contact frequency with the father; (c) co-parenting families (joint physical custody); and (d) father families. The main conclusion is that, on average, the effects of joint physical custody for children, mothers, and especially for fathers, are slightly positive.

AB  - Joint physical custody (JPC), a parental care arrangement in which a child lives with each parent for at least 25-50% of the time after separation or divorce, is increasingly common in many Western societies. This is a major shift from the standard of sole physical custody, with mostly mothers providing primary childcare after a parental separation or divorce. The increasing share of separated or divorced parents who practice JPC, which in some countries, US states, and regions reaches 30% and more, results from increasing gender equality due to mothers participating considerably in the labor force and fathers being actively involved in their children's daily lives. This review focuses on the effects of JPC on children's and parents' well-being, based on 40 studies from North America, Australia, and Europe published between 2007 and 2018. In sum, there is empirical evidence from different countries that suggests that JPC arrangements can have positive effects on the well-being of children and of parents. However, the existing studies are conceptually, methodologically, and contextually very heterogeneous. In addition, self-selected highly educated parents with a high socio-economic status, a low conflict level, and children between the ages of 6-15 practicing JPC dominate the samples. Thus, the risks and benefits of JPC are not clear yet and are heavily debated by advocates and academics. The review concludes with suggestions for future research.

AB  - Joint physical custody, a parental care arrangement in which a child lives with each parent about equally after separation or divorce, is an increasingly common phenomenon in many Western countries. Although attention from family scholars, practitioners, and law professionals is growing, there are hardly any numbers on the prevalence of joint physical custody (JPC). Moreover, studies using large-scale representative data on the effects of JPC for children's well-being are still rare. The data for this study come from Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC), a representative cross-national survey of adolescents in 37 European and North American countries that was conducted in 2002, 2006, and 2010 and included information on students at the ages of 11, 13, and 15 years (N = 92,886). First, results revealed that symmetrical JPC after family dissolution is still very rare in the majority of countries (5% or less), but reaches 10-20% in some countries. Second, adolescents' life satisfaction in nonintact families is higher in symmetric JPC arrangements than in asymmetric care arrangements. However, after controlling for children and family characteristics, the differences disappear. Thus, it is not the symmetric JPC arrangement that induces adolescents' higher life satisfaction, but rather the children and family characteristics that are associated with the choice of such a custody arrangement by separated or divorced parents.

AB  - Joint physical custody (JPC), a parental care arrangement in which children live with each parent about equally after separation or divorce, is an increasingly common phenomenon in many countries. This is a major shift away from the standard of sole physical custody (SPC), in which children live primarily with one parent (usually their mother) after family dissolution. Although attention to JPC by social scientists is growing, and the effects of this arrangement on children's well-being are the subject of highly ideological debates, there is currently little empirical evidence with statistical power on JPC. Using data from Family Models in Germany (FAMOD), a survey of postseparation families conducted in 2019, we estimated four linear regression models for children aged 2-14 in SPC and JPC families, with analytic samples of up to 1,161 cases. We investigated the association between physical custody arrangements after separation or divorce and four dimensions of children's well-being: psychological, physical, social, and cognitive/educational. The bivariate results provided support for the hypothesis that children living in JPC families fare significantly better than children living in SPC families on all four dimensions of well-being. However, after controlling for a set of child, parent, and separation characteristics, as well as for the quality of family relationships, the differences between children from SPC and JPC families disappeared. Additional analyses revealed that the parent-child relationships fully mediated this association. In sum, the quality of family relationships accounted for the positive association between JPC and children's well-being in this study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Petitions by custodial parents to relocate children away from noncustodial parents present difficult choices for family courts. In the current study, the sample (N = 81) was randomly recruited through the children's schools according to the following criteria: Children were 12 years old and at the time resided primarily with their mothers and mothers had been living with a male partner "acting in a father role" for at least the previous year. Thirty-eight children had been separated by more than an hour's drive from their biological fathers because of either their mothers or fathers relocating. The data were collected from 2 reporters (children and mothers) at 5 time points (child ages 12.5, 14, 15.5, 19.5, and 22) by trained interviewers using standardized measures with adequate reliability and validity. Long-distance separation from biological fathers prior to age 12 was linked in adolescence and young adulthood to serious behavior problems, anxiety and depression symptoms, and disturbed relationships with all three parental figures (i.e., biological fathers, mothers, and stepfathers). These associations held after controlling for mother-stepfather conflict and domestic violence, mothers' family income, and mother-biological father relationship quality. These longitudinal findings over time replicated the cross-sectional findings of Braver, Ellman, and Fabricius (2003) and Fabricius and Braver (2006). Policy implications for parental long-distance relocation following separation are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Drawing on empirical data from biographical interviews with divorced Lithuanian men, this article examines how they undo fatherhood based on the breadwinner ideology. In a Lithuanian culture of strong economic obligations of men for child support and alimony and weak paternal rights to custody and care, the divorced fathers’ role consists primarily of their financial responsibility. By using the theoretical framework of undoing gender (Butler, J. (2004). Undoing gender. New York: Routledge; Deutsch, F. (2007). Undoing gender. Gender & Society, 21(1), 106–127), the authors argue that the economic aspects of fathering remain most important in the successful doing of fatherhood. However, in undoing the traditional fatherhood and refuting the widespread assumptions about men's secondary role as caregivers, the divorced men not only defied gendered perceptions of individual competencies but also clashed with gender normativity. Moreover, our research demonstrates that besides socio-legal constraints the fathers’ cooperative relationships with their former spouses were also a decisive factor in undoing fatherhood.

The results of the linear regression models indicated that children in JPC families had better mental health than children in sole physical custody families, and that PLC behaviours negatively affected children's mental health. Furthermore, children's experiences of PLC behaviours moderated the association between JPC and their mental health, with high levels of PLC behaviours leading to a noticeable decline in the mental health of children in JPC families.

AB  - Divorce represents a breakdown of the individual and familiar life-span, and requires relevant psychological process(es) of reorganization for the components of the broken families. The challenge for divorced parents is that divorce introduces elements of continuity and discontinuity in the evolution of the family. The ex-partners, even though they are no longer married, continue to be co-parent. The aims of this work are to analyse the process(es) of reorganization, in a sample of Italian divorced families (N = 93), with regards to the constructs of adjustment to divorce, co-parenting and family alliance and to explore their relationships. Multi-method procedures involve both self report measures for the evaluation of representations' level and observational measures for the evaluation of interactive models. Preliminary results indicate functional and dysfunctional pathways between the families and show the association between representation level and interactive practices.

AB  - Large numbers of infants and toddlers have parents who live apart due to separation, divorce, or nonmarital/noncohabiting child-bearing, yet this important topic, especially the controversial issue of frequent overnights with nonresidential parents, is understudied. The authors analyzed data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal investigation of children born to primarily low-income, racial/ethnic minority parents that is representative of 20 U.S. cities with populations over 200,000. Among young children whose parents lived apart, 6.9% of infants (birth to age 1) and 5.3% of toddlers (ages 1 to 3) spent an average of at least 1 overnight per week with their nonresident parent. An additional 6.8% of toddlers spent 35% - 70% of overnights with nonresident parents. Frequent overnights were significantly associated with attachment insecurity among infants, but the relationship was less clear for toddlers. Attachment insecurity predicted adjustment problems at ages 3 and 5, but frequent overnights were not directly linked with adjustment problems at older ages.

AB  - This article studies shared physical custody in Sweden, the country in the world where the phenomenon is most prevalent. We ask whether children in shared physical custody settings are more likely to report high levels of stress compared to children living in sole custody. The analysis is based on data with combined information from parents, children, and administrative registers. The models are controlled control for interparental as well as parent-child relationship quality and parents' income. The results show that children sharing residence equally have lower likelihood of experiencing high levels of stress. The results can be interpreted as evidence for a positive effect of continuing everyday-like parental relationships after a family dissolution.

AB  - Objectives: Parental support has been shown to be important for children's self-esteem, which in turn is related to later important life outcomes. Today, an increasing number of children in the Western world spend time in both the parents' respective households after a separation. Children who live with both parents report more parental support than children who live only with one parent after a divorce. We took the opportunity of the commonness of children sharing their time between their parents' homes in Sweden to investigate children's self-esteem in relation to family type. Study design and methods: With nationally representative survey data (ULF) collected from both parents and children, we analyze differences in children's self-esteem among 4823 10-18 year olds in nuclear families, joint physical custody and those living mostly or only with one parent after a separation using ordinary least squares regression, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Results: We found no significant difference in self-esteem between children who lived equally much with both parents, mostly with one parent and those in nuclear families, whereas children in single care showed lower self-esteem compared with children in the other living arrangements. The difference was not explained by socioeconomic factors. Conclusion: The self-esteem of children who share their time between their parent's respective homes after a separation does not deviate from that in their peers in nuclear families. Instead, those in single care reported lower self-esteem than those in the other living arrangements. These differences were not explained by socioeconomic factors. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish pre- and post-separation family characteristics that influence self-esteem and well-being in young people.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of children and adolescents divide their time between their separated parents' homes. Although marital conflict is disadvantageous for children's sleep, little is known about how children of separated parents sleep. The objective was to investigate the association between children's custody arrangements and sleep habits and sleep initiation difficulties. DESIGN: Cross sectional nationally representative samples of adolescents from the WHO study Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) (n = 11,802). SETTING: Sweden in 2013/2014 and 2017/2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents in grades 5, 7, and 9 from Swedish compulsory comprehensive school. MEASUREMENTS: The survey included questions on sleep behaviors including bedtime, wake-up time and frequency of sleep onset problems. The analysis methods used were ordinary least squares and logistic regression. RESULTS: The results show differences by custody arrangement, but they are not uniform across the dependent variables. Children and adolescents in sole maternal custody were less likely to sleep as much as recommended (P < .001), more likely to have late bedtimes (P < .001), report sleep initiation difficulties (P < .01) and to report social jetlag between school mornings and weekends (P < .05) compared to those in 2-parent families. Shared physical custody was associated with a higher likelihood of late bedtimes (P < .05) and sleep initiation difficulties (P < .05) compared to those in 2-parent families, but not of sleeping less than recommended or reporting social jetlag. Less-than-equal sharing was generally associated with worse sleep than in 2-parent families. CONCLUSIONS: As custody arrangements seem to be associated with sleep, it is important to understand the mechanisms behind the findings.

AB  - It is well established that adolescents living in father custody are more likely to be involved in antisocial behavior and substance use, as compared to adolescents living in mother custody. This study assessed whether these differences also pertain to a wider spectrum of health-related outcomes. A second aim was to investigate the role of a stepparent on adolescents' health-related adjustment. A total of 6,447 Norwegian adolescents between ages 11 and 16 participated in the study. The findings revealed that the differences between adolescents in father versus mother custody might be somewhat more comprehensive than previous studies have observed, indicating increased risks for adjustment problems among adolescents living with a single father on various health-related outcomes. Generally, a stepmother does not seem to compensate for the risks of adjustment problems, but might have a positive influence on certain health-related behaviors.

AB  - This study examines the association between joint physical custody and adolescent wellbeing and whether this relationship is conditioned by the degree of parental conflict, the quality of the parent-child relationship and the complexity of the family configuration of mother and father. We use data from the LAGO-project, containing information on 1,570 children with divorced parents. Overall the wellbeing of children in joint physical custody is similar to that of children in other custody arrangements. However, under certain circumstances joint physical custody can become negatively related to child wellbeing. We find support for the moderating effects of parental conflict, quality of the relationship with mother and father, and the presence of a new partner in the parental households.

AB  - In recent decades there have been two significant legislative amendments to shared parenting in Belgium. In 1995, joint exercise of parental responsibilities was introduced as the default legal position. In 2006, the legislation required that in all cases of joint parenthood in which parents could not agree on children's living arrangements, equally divided alternating residence must first be considered by the judge. In this article, we summarize recent research findings from Belgium about alternating residence for children. There has been a fourfold increase in alternating residence, and families in these arrangements became increasingly diverse. Compared to children living exclusively with their mothers, children in alternating residences report a better relationship with their father, while mothers report a more active personal social life. For children, alternating residence is found to be more challenging under certain conditions (e.g. no communication between parents). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - After divorce, shorter distances between parents' homes are often seen as facilitating nonresident fathers' involvement with their children, good coparenting practices, and children's well-being. However, few studies have explored how geographical distance relates to coparenting and children's adjustment. Moreover, the direction of causality remains unclear, as uninvolved fathers due to paternal disinterest, maternal gatekeeping, or interparental conflict are more likely to move farther away from their children. Based on a probability sample of 144 divorced mothers of school-aged children living in Geneva, Switzerland, this study explores how the distance between parents' homes relates to maternal promotion of the father-child relationship (cohesive coparenting) and children's emotional and behavioral outcomes. Results show that cohesive coparenting relates more to frequent father-child contacts by phone or e-mails than to residential proximity. Both cohesive coparenting and fathers' residential proximity have positive and independent effects on children's adjustment. Children whose fathers live nearby exhibit fewer behavioral difficulties and more prosocial behavior than children whose fathers live far away. These findings suggest that frequent contacts by phone or e-mail can substitute for distance in coparenting, but geographical proximity still matters for fathers' contribution to children's well-being. Overall, this study recommends that spatial and mobility dimensions should receive more attention in divorce research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study compared adolescents who alternate residences between their divorced parents with adolescents who live with both parents or with one divorced parent. Care was scored equally for adolescents with alternating residences and for those living with both biological parents but lower for adolescents living with a single parent. Overprotection showed the converse. Presence of psychiatric symptoms was equal for adolescents who alternate residences and for those living with both parents, but it was higher for those living with a single parent. Sense of coherence was noted to be higher among teens with alternating residences and teens living with both parents, but it was lower among those living with a single parent.

AB  - Multilocal, dual residence or shared parenting arrangements after parental separation are increasingly discussed in many countries. So far, however, there is only little information about shared physical custody in Germany. The present research uses the second wave of the German survey "Growing up in Germany" (2013-2015) to investigate the prevalence and likely conditions for practicing shared physical custody after separation. The sample comprises 1,042 minor children with separated parents (reported by mothers). Measured by children's overnight stays with each parent, only 5 % of these children lived in a (symmetrical or asymmetrical) dual residence arrangement (50:50 up to 70:30 of overnight stays with either parent). According to findings from logistic regression, shared physical custody was more likely if maternal and paternal residences were in close proximity, and if the mother had higher levels of education. Furthermore, shared physical custody was more likely if the parents had a positive cooperative co-parenting relationship, but interestingly, also when co-parenting problems were high. This suggests that shared physical custody may be used as compromise in cases of interparental conflict. Our findings point to the importance of future prospective longitudinal studies.

Remschmidt, 1998) and the scale emotionality of the FPI-R (Fahrenberg, Hampel, Selg, 2000). Contact between fathers and children after parental separation was mainly associated with parental conflict and contact during and after the separation. No significant associations were found with age and gender of the child, maternal remarriage or paternal education. The relationship to the father mediated the effects of family arrangement on different measures of child well-being. In separated families children with little contact to their fathers showed worse relationships to them compared to children in intact families. Good father-child relationships were positively associated with different measures of children's well-being. A central conclusion of this study is, that the father-child relationship is an important source for child's well-being.

AB  - The 2006 family law reforms were designed to strengthen family relationships regardless of the parents' relationship status, and to protect and promote children's wellbeing. A key question that arises from the changes is: Under what circumstances are children advantaged or disadvantaged by arrangements that set out or encourage significant amounts of time with both parents? This article therefore examines four issues: the prevalence of different care-time arrangements in families that experienced parental separation after July 2006; parents' views about the flexibility and workability of their arrangements; characteristics of families with different care-time arrangements; and the strength of the relationship between child wellbeing on the one hand, and care-time arrangements and family dynamics on the other. The analysis is based on Wave 1 of a survey of 10,002 parents who participated in the first wave of the Longitudinal Study of Separated Families in 2008.

AB  - Although an increasing number of children live in shared residence arrangements after parental divorce, studies on their social relationships are rare. We address this research gap by relying on configurational approaches, social capital and social networks. Building on qualitative case studies (ego‐centred networks, interviews) with 14 children aged 10–14, results show that respondents constructed social ties based on two key categories: emotional closeness and constancy. Having two places of residence did not multiply close relations, and relations that entered the network after parental divorce (e.g. step kin) were particularly distant. Children's networks at both homes had limited interconnections.

AB  - Barns oppvekstvilkår i Norge har de siste 30 årene vært gjennom store endringer på flere plan.
Pr. i dag opplever ca 50 % av barna at foreldrene går fra hverandre og familiene organiseres
på nytt på ulike måter. Et bostedsalternativ som er under sterk fremvekst er delt bosted, hvor
barna ukentlig flytter mellom mors og fars hjem. Jeg har gjennom mitt arbeid i skolen og PPtjenesten ofte møter med barn og foreldre som opplever boformen som utfordrende, og har
derfor fattet spesiell interesse for disse familienes livssituasjon. Med dette som bakgrunn
ønsket jeg gjennom masterprosjektet å gå dypere inn i temaet «Delt bosted – når
utfordringene blir for store».
Prosjektet er en empirisk studie av livssituasjonen til barn som flytter mellom mor og far, og
der dette ikke oppleves å være til barnets beste.
Problemstillingen for undersøkelsen er: Hvilke helsemessige, sosiale og faglige konsekvenser
registres hos disse barna?
Prosjektet er en empirisk studie og den metodiske tilnærmingen er kvalitative metoder med
åpne og semistrukturerte intervjuer. Datamaterialet som prosjektet bygger på er hentet fra
følgende utvalg: Fire foreldreinformanter og ni fagpersoner fra følgende etater: skole,
helsesøstertjenesten, familievernet, barnevernet, barne- og ungdomspsykiatrisk poliklinikk
(BUP), og Barneombudet.
Studien baserer seg på samfunnsmessige og politiske endringer, nyere forskning og
undersøkelser innenfor mestring og utvikling hos barn knyttet opp mot
skillsmisseproblematikk generelt, og utfordringer i forhold til å leve med delt bosted spesielt.
Resultater og funn i datamaterialet fra foreldreinformantene drøftes opp mot utviklingsteori,
tidligere forskning, og erfaringene informantene fra hjelpeapparatet har fra familier i
tilsvarende situasjon.
Funn fra undersøkelsen kan i korte trekk beskrives ved følgende punkter:
x Delt bosted kan for noen barn oppleves svært krevende. For noen barn er
utfordringene så store at det påvirker både barnets psykiske helse og sosiale liv.
x En søskenflokk bør ikke vurderes som en enhet. Hvert barn bør sees individuelt i
forhold til selvstendighet, sårbarhet og spesielle behov når det skal vurderes hva som
er gode bostedsordninger for barna etter et samlivsbrudd.
5
x Foreldre har behov for mer kunnskap og hjelp enn det de får i dag. Dette gjelder
spesielt det første året etter samlivsbruddet.
x Tilbud fra hjelpeapparatet er for fragmentert. En mer helhetlig tenkning er nødvendig

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the association between family structure and adolecent mental health, after the considerable increase in divorced parents choosing joint physical custody (JPC) in Norway. Data stem from the youth@hordaland study, a population-based survey conducted in Norway in 2012. A total of 7,707 adolescents (47% male) 16 to 19 years old were included in this study. The adolescents were classified into 6 family structures. Mental health was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). No significant differences between nondivorced families (reference) and JPC were observed. Adolescents from single-parent and stepfather families scored significantly higher on all 3 SDQ scales, and adolescents from stepmother families scored significantly higher on the SDQ total and SDQ externalizing scales. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that adolescents living in JPC did not have more adjustment problems compared to their peers living in nondivorced families.

AB  - INTERVENTION: Intensive psychosocial intervention minus antipsychotic medication. Participants randomised to this intervention will be administered placebo tablets. The psychosocial intervention consists of four modules: intensive case management (engagement, problem solving, advocacy and support); close monitoring and crisis response; cognitive‐behaviour therapy for symptoms; family support and education. The intensive psychosocial intervention will consist of twice‐weekly contact with the treating team during the first 2 months of the study, and weekly contact after the first 2 months. In total, the treatment will be provided for 6 months. Placebo medication will be titrated in 1mg increments at the discretion of the treating clinician over a four‐week period, until a maximum maintenance dose of 6mg/day is reached, if required. Dose will be held at 2mg/day if adequate response is observed within 4 weeks. The medication will be packaged to allow flexible dosing. CONDITION: First episode psychosis PRIMARY OUTCOME: Social and occupational functioning, as rated on the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). SECONDARY OUTCOME: Psychiatric symptomatology, including positive psychotic symptoms, negative psychotic symptoms, and mood and anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). INCLUSION CRITERIA: • Ability to give informed consent (Capacity to give informed consent will be assessed by an Orygen Youth Health doctor in cases where an intellectual disability is suspected) • Adequate comprehension of English to enable study assessments to be conducted • Low suicidality (as defined by a score of < 5 on the exBPRS Suicidality subscale, i.e., no more than occasional suicidal thoughts with no plan or intent) • Low aggressiveness (as defined by a score of < 5 on the exBPRS Hostility scale, i.e., may have been angry or yelled on several occasions but has not threatened people or thrown objects) • Currently living in stable accommodation, in regular contact with people who support the young person's participation in the study.

AB  - INTERVENTION: Evidence‐Based Intensive Recovery Treatment (EBIRT) combines two well‐validated and manualised psychosocial interventions; Individual Placement and Support (IPS) for vocational recovery and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for Relapse Prevention. IPS is (a) focussed upon competitive employment, education or training as an outcome; and (b) focussed upon immediate job/education searching. EBIRT will be delivered in two phases; a 9‐month intensive phase which entails two sessions of individual therapy per week for 9‐months, followed by a 6‐9 month (dependent on tenure remaining in service)‐ maintenance/monitoring phase in which individual therapy sessions will be delivered every 4‐6 weeks. EBIRT will be provided by a therapist trained in CBT and is comprised of six or more modules of therapy delivered over the 9 month intensive period. Each CBT session will be for approximately 1 hour in length and will aimed to be delivered twice a week, but will be dependent on the participants availability. There is no minimum required session per week.. IPS will be delivered separately by a trained vocational support worker. The aim will be for IPS to be delivered weekly but this is flexible and will be dependent on the individuals vocational support requirements. The six phases of EBIRT intervention include: (1) initiation of vocational intervention (2) formulation and agenda setting; including vocational goal setting; (3) engagement and assessment for recovery and risk for relapse; (4) psychoeducation with a focus on relapse; (5) early warning signs and relapse planning – will also involve family members with participant’s consent; and, treatment and progress review (6). Additional optional modules may be drawn upon depending on case formulation and clinical determination in collaboration with the participant include: substance abuse, stress management, and co‐morbid anxiety and depression at the investigator’s discretion. In tandem with EBIRT, participants will be randomly assigned following baseline assessment to either the DRS or AMTx treatment conditions. Dose Reduction Strategy (DRS+) group: Participants who are randomised to this arm of the trial will be offered a gradual dose reduction of their antipsychotic medication. Medication will be tapered under close medical supervision over 3‐months after allocation to the DRS group to avoid relapse due to abrupt discontinuation. The rate of tapering will be a 25% dose reduction (or as near to 25% as the medication allows) of the pre‐reduction dose every month for 3 months, If clinically safe as determined by the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) treating team. If discontinuation criteria (psychotic relapse or exacerbation) is met at any time throughout the study, the minimum therapeutic dose will be continued or reinstated. As per routine guidelines, the young person’s treating doctor will review their treatment options with them at discharge from EPPIC, this will coincide with their end of treatment. The participant will then remain on the last dose for the remainder of EBIRT after the 3 months of DRS unless clinically indicated, in which case anti‐psychotic medication can be reinstated. This will be done in consultation with the Principal Investigator, the Consultant Psychiatrist and the participants treating team. Treatment fidelity will be ensured via the following procedures: (a) treatment manuals detailing treatment procedures; (b) ongoing weekly group supervision providing feedback with clinical supervisors; and (c) audio‐taping of EBIRT therapy sessions for all participants, unless they have explicitly stated they do not wish to be record. These recordings will be independently rated using previously developed fidelity measures. CONDITION: First Episode Psychosis PRIMARY OUTCOME: Social and Occupational functioning assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS). SECONDARY OUTCOME: Brain volumes/activity is a composite secondary outcome‐ Brain volume will be quantified in both treatment groups and healthy controls by high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to structural MRI imaging, functional resting state will also be performed. Cognitive functioning will assessed with neurocognitive tests (including the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) will be used to assess neuropsychological functioning in all groups. Physical health is a composite secondary outcome and will be measured by clinical blood analysis evaluating glucose, haemoglobin A1C, and lipid levels in the treatment groups only. Blood pressure, weight, height and waist circumference will also be recorded. Remission and relapse rates of positive symptoms is a composite secondary outcome and will be assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (exBPRS) in treatment groups only. Remission of negative symptoms will be assessed using the Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Current client of EPPIC. 2. A confirmed diagnosis of first episode of a DSM 5 psychotic disorder or mood disorder with psychotic features as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview (Modules A‐D) for DSM‐5 Axis I Disorders, patient version (SCID‐RV); 3. Aged 15‐25 years (inclusive). 4. Greater than 3 months of remission on positive symptoms of psychosis in the first year of antipsychotic treatment at EPPIC (a score of less than 3 (mild) on the hallucinations, unusual thought disorder, conceptual disorganisation, and suspiciousness subscale items of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (exBPRS). 5. Low suicidality defined as a score of 4 or below on the exBPRS sustained for the past 1‐month period prior to baseline. 6. The young person is willing for their carer to be informed about the study and will have at least weekly contact with their carer. 7. Ability to provide written informed consent.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine and evaluate the efficacy of the spectrum of psychological and behavioral intercession as a novel treatment regime to address the necessity of Schizophrenia affected patients. METHOD: A sum of 148 individuals with the first episode of Schizophrenia enrolled in the trial. Patients admitted in our medium-sized hospital with symptoms of schizophrenia were scrutinized carefully and selected for the intercession trial. Total selected individuals were bifurcated into two groups based on guidelines prescribed in the intervention model. Control group or standard care group (SCG) was treated with usual medications and nursing measures of psychiatry practices. Experimental Group (EG) was conferred with enriched psychological strategy and behavioral modules to tackle and satisfy their specific needs. Various methods such as positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS), several disability screening schedule (SDGSS), satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), global assessment scale (GAS) and finally rate of recurrence of disease were evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS: Efficacy of psychological and behavioral intercession on psychotic domine is proved to be effective, and a novel strategy and it is significantly reducing positive and negative psychological symptoms in the experimental group was observed attributing to the intercession. Moreover, a drastic attenuation in the rate of recurrence of disease was supporting a long term efficiency of intercession. CONCLUSION: Conducting intervention on psychological and behavioral approach has explored novel treatment outcomes, targeted schizophrenia patients effectively.

AB  - Objective: Patients with first‐episode psychosis are responsive to acute phase treatments, but relapse rates are high. Treatment with specialist early psychosis services is associated with lower relapse rates compared to standard care. However, there is no evidence that targeted psychological therapies for relapse prevention can improve further upon these outcomes. The EPISODE II study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel multi‐modal psychosocial treatment designed to prevent the second episode of psychosis compared with standardized early psychosis care. Method: The Episode II trial was a randomized controlled effectiveness trial which compared a 7‐month multi‐modal individual and family cognitive behaviour therapy for relapse prevention with standardized case management within a specialist early psychosis service (The Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, EPPIC, Melbourne). Results: Forty one patients and their relatives were assigned to the relapse prevention therapy and 40 to standardized case management. The relapse rate was significantly lower in the therapy condition (5.3%) compared to treatment as usual (21.8%) (P = 0.042) and time to relapse was significantly longer for the relapse therapy condition (P = 0.03) at 7‐month follow‐up. The number needed to treat was six to prevent one relapse over 7 months. Regarding family outcomes, there were significant group effects in favour of the relapse prevention therapy for aspects of the appraisal of caregiving, including negative symptoms, positive personal experiences and total positive score on the Experience of Caregiving Inventory. Time effects were evident for emotional overinvolvement and for aspects of the appraisal of caregiving. Conclusion: While relapse rates were low for both groups, the relapse prevention therapy provided within a specialist early psychosis program was effective in reducing relapse in early psychosis when compared with standardized early psychosis case management. Furthermore a CBT relapse prevention program shows promise in improving the experience of caregiving for first‐episode family members over a 2.5 year follow‐up period.

AB  - Antipsychotics, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and omega‐3‐fatty acids have been found superior to control conditions as regards prevention of psychosis in people at‐risk of first‐episode psychosis. However, no large‐scale trial evaluating the differential efficacy of CBT and antipsychotics has been performed yet. In PREVENT, we evaluate CBT, aripiprazole, and clinical management (CM) as well as placebo and CM for the prevention of psychosis in a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial with regard to the antipsychotic intervention and a randomized controlled trial with regard to the CBT intervention with blinded ratings. The hypotheses are first that CBT and aripiprazole and CM are superior to placebo and CM and second that CBT is not inferior to aripiprazole and CM combined. The primary outcome is transition to psychosis. By November 2010, 156 patients were recruited into the trial. The subjects were substantially functionally compromised (Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale mean score 52.5) and 78.3% presented with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition axis I comorbid diagnosis. Prior to randomization, 51.5% of the participants preferred to be randomized into the CBT arm, whereas only 12.9% preferred pharmacological treatment. First, assessments of audiotaped treatment sessions confirmed the application of CBT‐specific skills in the CBT condition and the absence of those in CM. The overall quality rating of the CBT techniques applied in the CBT condition was good. When the final results of the trial are available, PREVENT will substantially expand the current limited evidence base for best clinical practice in people at‐risk (prodromal) of first‐episode psychosis.

AB  - The Soteria project (1971–1983) compared residential treatment in the community and minimal use of antipsychotic medication with “usual” hospital treatment for patients with early episode schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. Newly diagnosed DSM-II schizophrenia subjects were assigned consecutively (1971 to 1976, N = 79) or randomly (1976 to 1979, N = 100) to the hospital or Soteria and followed for 2 years. Admission diagnoses were subsequently converted to DSM-IV schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder. Multivariate analyses evaluated hypotheses of equal or better outcomes in Soteria on eight individual outcome measures and a composite outcome scale in three ways: for endpoint subjects (N = 160), for completing subjects (N = 129), and for completing subjects corrected for differential attrition (N = 129). Endpoint subjects exhibited small to medium effect size trends favoring experimental treatment. Completing subjects had significantly better composite outcomes of a medium effect size at Soteria (+.47 SD, p = .03). Completing subjects with schizophrenia exhibited a large effect size benefit with Soteria treatment (+.81 SD, p = .02), particularly in domains of psychopathology, work, and social functioning. Soteria treatment resulted in better 2-year outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed schizophrenia spectrum psychoses, particularly for completing subjects and for those with schizophrenia. In addition, only 58% of Soteria subjects received antipsychotic medications during the follow-up period, and only 19% were continuously maintained on antipsychotic medications.

AB  - Despite the vast number of clinical investigations of tranquilizing agents which followed their introduction, relatively few studies have used adequate controls. Such controlled studies as were done often were based on small numbers of patients, involved differing control techniques, or led to contradictory conclusions.1-6Because of the difficulty in obtaining controlled drug studies of sufficient scope to be clinically meaningful, a cooperative study was planned to include psychiatric hospitals in the Veterans Administration nation-wide system. Such a study had the advantage of including a large and well-defined sample of patients treated in multiple hospital settings. Difficulties, anticipated in establishing a commonly understood research protocol and obtaining evaluations of treatment sufficiently similar to permit pooling of the data, did not prove to be insurmountable.At the time this study was planned, two trends were already evident in regard to tranquilizing drugs.7 One was that reserpine

AB  - Background: Currently, there is no consensus regarding how long antipsychotics medication should be continued following a first psychotic episode. Clinically, patients often request discontinuation after a period of remission. This is one of the first double‐blind randomized‐controlled studies designed to address the issue. Methods: Between September 2003 and July 2006, patients with DSM‐IV schizophrenia and related psychoses (excluding substance‐induced psychosis) who remitted well following a first episode, and had remained well on maintenance medication for 1 year, were randomized to receive either maintenance treatment with quetiapine (400 mg/day) or placebo for 12 months. Relapse was defined by the re‐emergence of psychotic symptoms according to predefined thresholds. Results: 178 patients were randomized. One hundred forty‐four patients completed the study (80.9%). The Kaplan‐Meier estimate of relapse risk was 41% (95% CI, 29%‐53%) for the maintenance group and 79% (95% CI, 68%‐90%) for the placebo group (P < 0.001). Relapse was not related to age or gender. Other significant predictors of relapse include patients on placebo, having more pre‐morbid schizotypal traits, scoring lower in logical memory test and having more soft neurological signs. Conclusions: There is a substantial risk of relapse if medication is discontinued in remitted first‐episode psychosis patients following 1 year of maintenance therapy. On the contrary, a proportion of patients discontinued medication and remained well.

Design 12 month randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial.  Setting Early psychosis outpatient clinics in Hong Kong.  Participants 178 patients with first episode psychosis who had received at least one year of antipsychotic drug treatment between September 2003 and July 2006 and had no positive symptoms of psychosis.  Interventions Patients received either maintenance treatment with quetiapine (400 mg/day) or placebo and were followed up for the next 12 months or until a relapse occurred.  Main outcome measure Relapse assessed monthly and defined as re-emergence of psychotic symptoms (delusions, conceptual disorganisation, hallucinations, suspiciousness, and unusual thought content) according to predefined thresholds.  Results 178 patients were randomised (89 to quetiapine and 89 to placebo).

AB  - Background: Attention and memory in early psychosis are associated with functional impairment. Pharmacological intervention has not always been successful (Addington, 2007). Following the initial findings in chronic patients (Pajonk et al, 2010), this study explores the effects of aerobic exercise and mind‐body exercise (yoga) on cognition in female early psychosis patients. Methods: Female early psychosis patients were randomized into yoga, aerobic exercise, and control groups. In this preliminary analysis, 82 patients completed the 12‐week study (29 in yoga group, 25 in exercise group, and 28 in control group). Interventions were held three times weekly, with each session lasted for an hour. Participants were assessed for clinical symptoms and cognitive functioning both at the baseline and 12 weeks. Results: There was no significant baseline difference between the three groups. Both yoga and aerobic exercise groups demonstrated a significant improvement in the verbal encoding (ANOVA , P < .01), short‐term memory (P <.05), and working memory (P <.01) compared to control groups. Both yoga and aerobic exercise could reduce depression scores (P < .01). Additionally, there was a significant improvement in the subjective evaluation of cognitive performance, which was correlated with the improvement of cognitive assessments (r = .45, P <.01). Aerobic exercise group showed a significant enhancement in VO 2 (P <.05), which was correlated with the improvement in memory (r = .44, P <.01). Conclusion: In a sample of female early psychosis patients, both aerobic and mind‐body exercises improved cognition. Cognitive improvements were correlated with subjective evaluation. Further research on the differential effects of yoga and aerobic exercise on memory should be explored.

AB  - Current psychosocial interventions in schizophrenia are evidenced to improve patients' illness‐related knowledge, mental status and relapse rate, but substantive benefits to patients, such as their functioning and insight into the illness, remain uncertain. This multi‐centre randomised clinical trial aimed to examine the effects of mindfulness‐based psycho‐education group intervention for adult patients with early‐stage schizophrenia over an 18‐month follow‐up. The controlled trial was conducted with a repeated‐measure, three‐arm design at two psychiatric outpatient clinics in Jilin (China) and Hong Kong. A stratified random sample of 180 outpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (60/group) was randomly assigned to a mindfulness‐based psycho‐education group programme, psycho‐education group and treatment‐as‐usual group. The primary outcomes on patients' psychosocial functioning and other patient outcomes, such as psychotic symptoms, in the three groups were compared over the 18‐month follow‐up (baseline and 1‐week, 9‐month and 18‐month post‐intervention). One hundred and sixty (89%) patients completed at least two post‐tests. Their mean age and duration of illness were 25â€“28 years (SD = 6.1â€“7.8) and 2.1â€“2.5 years (SD = 1.3â€“2.0; range 4â€“54 months), respectively. Compared with the two other groups, the mindfulness‐based group exhibited a significantly greater improvement with moderate to large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.49â€“0.98) in functioning (p = 0.005), duration of psychiatric re‐hospitalisations (p = 0.007), psychotic symptoms (p = 0.008) and illness insight (p = 0.001) over the 18‐month follow‐up. Supplementary MRI findings indicated that the mindfulness‐based intervention resulted in significant changes in gray matter volume and density in brain regions concerning attention and emotional regulation. Mindfulness‐oriented psycho‐education group intervention can be an effective intervention for adults with early‐stage schizophrenia and exert long‐term effects on patients' functioning and mental conditions.

AB  - Background: First episode psychosis (FEP) has been consistently associated with changes within grey matter. No prospective study to date has been able to distinguish the differential effects of antipsychotic medication from the natural progression of psychosis on these changes. Methods: We conducted a triple‐blind randomised placebo‐control trial where 90 people aged between 15 to 24 with FEP received either an atypical antipsychotic or a placebo pill over a treatment period of 6 months, with a sub‐group (N=62) undergoing neuroimaging. Both FEP groups received intensive psychosocial therapy. A healthy control group (n=27) were also recruited. T1‐w structural MRI scans at 3‐Tesla were taken at baseline, 3‐months and 12‐months. Longitudinal Voxel‐Based‐Morphometry was used to identify grey matter areas where the rate of change between the three groups was significantly different across timepoints. Results: Using robust non‐parametric methods, and after controlling for baseline age, sex, total intracranial volume and medication dose following treatment conclusion, a cluster within the medial and inferior temporal cortex showed a significant group x time interaction (k = 213, p < 0.05 FWE‐corrected). Within the medication group, the volume of this area normalised to that of the healthy control group at the 3‐month time point, then continued to increase to a size greater than that of the healthy control group at the 12‐month follow‐up. Volume remained reduced within the placebo group at the 3‐month timepoint but trended towards normalisation at the 12‐month timepoint. Additionally, the rate of change between baseline and three months within this cluster was significantly correlated (r = ‐.53, p < 0.01) with the primary trial outcome measure: The Social an Occupational Functional Assessment Scale. Discussion: Antipsychotic medication normalises the initially reduced volume of the temporal cortex. However, a similar pattern of normalization may be seen over a longer period of time in those who received placebo. Additionally, greater change within the same area is associated with poorer functional outcome, suggesting that the processes and networks supported medial and inferior temporal cortex may play a primary role in maintaining social and occupational functioning.

AB  - Background: Altered functional connectivity (FC) is a common finding in resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) studies of people with psychosis, yet how FC disturbances evolve in the early stages of illness, and how antipsychotic treatment influences these disturbances, remains unknown. Method(s): We conducted a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled rs-fMRI study where 62 antipsychotic-naive people with First Episode Psychosis (FEP) received either an atypical antipsychotic or a placebo pill over a treatment period of 6 months. Both FEP groups received intensive psychosocial therapy. A healthy control group was also recruited. Patients and healthy control subjects underwent a total of 202 rs-fMRI scans, which were obtained at baseline, 3-months, and 12-months. Result(s): At baseline, FEP patients showed widespread functional dysconnectivity in comparison to controls, with reductions predominantly affecting interactions between the default mode network (DMN), limbic systems, and the rest of the brain. From baseline to 3 months, patients receiving placebo showed increased FC principally within the same systems, and these changes correlated with improved clinical outcomes. Antipsychotic exposure was associated with increased FC primarily between the thalamus and the rest of the brain. At the 12-month follow-up, antipsychotic treatment was associated with a prolonged increase of FC primarily in the DMN and limbic systems. All results were statistically significant at p<.05 FWE-corrected. Conclusion(s): Antipsychotic-naive people with FEP show widespread functional dysconnectivity at baseline, followed by an early normalization of DMN and paralimbic dysfunction in patients receiving a psychosocial intervention only. Antipsychotic exposure is associated with distinct FC changes, principally concentrated on thalamocortical and limbic networks.

AB  - Changes in brain volume are a common finding in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies of people with psychosis and numerous longitudinal studies suggest that volume deficits progress with illness duration. However, a major unresolved question concerns whether these changes are driven by the underlying illness or represent iatrogenic effects of antipsychotic medication. In this study, 62 antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) received either a second-generation antipsychotic (risperidone or paliperidone) or a placebo pill over a treatment period of 6 months. Both FEP groups received intensive psychosocial therapy. A healthy control group (n = 27) was also recruited. Structural MRI scans were obtained at baseline, 3 months and 12 months. Our primary aim was to differentiate illness-related brain volume changes from medication-related changes within the first 3 months of treatment. We secondarily investigated long-term effects at the 12-month timepoint. From baseline to 3 months, we observed a significant group x time interaction in the pallidum (p < 0.05 FWE-corrected), such that patients receiving antipsychotic medication showed increased volume, patients on placebo showed decreased volume, and healthy controls showed no change. Across the entire patient sample, a greater increase in pallidal grey matter volume over 3 months was associated with a greater reduction in symptom severity. Our findings indicate that psychotic illness and antipsychotic exposure exert distinct and spatially distributed effects on brain volume. Our results align with prior work in suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of antipsychotic medications may be primarily mediated through their effects on the basal ganglia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a service for early psychosis. DESIGN: Randomised controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Community mental health teams in one London borough. PARTICIPANTS: 144 people aged 16‐40 years presenting to mental health services for the first or second time with non‐organic, non‐affective psychosis. INTERVENTIONS: Assertive outreach with evidence based biopsychosocial interventions (specialised care group) and standard care (control group) delivered by community mental health teams. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of relapse and readmission to hospital. RESULTS: Compared with patients in the standard care group, those in the specialised care group were less likely to relapse (odds ratio 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.97), were readmitted fewer times (beta 0.39, 0.10 to 0.68), and were less likely to drop out of the study (odds ratio 0.35, 0.15 to 0.81). When rates were adjusted for sex, previous psychotic episode, and ethnicity, the difference in relapse was no longer significant (odds ratio 0.55, 0.24 to 1.26); only total number of readmissions (beta 0.36, 0.04 to 0.66) and dropout rates (beta 0.28, 0.12 to 0.73) remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence shows that a team delivering specialised care for patients with early psychosis is superior to standard care for maintaining contact with professionals and for reducing readmissions to hospital. No firm conclusions can, however, be drawn owing to the modest sample size.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders is highly prevalent and notably influences functional outcomes. Aims: To characterise the cognitive effectiveness of second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Method: One hundred consecutive and previously unmedicated patients with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were admitted. Seventy-seven completed baseline, 1-month and 6-month psychopathological and neuropsychological assessments. Patients were randomised to risperidone or olanzapine treatment. Four final treatment allocation groups were defined since patients continued treatment in their normal setting: risperidone, olanzapine, mixed and no-antipsychotic groups. Results: There were no differences in cognitive effectiveness between the four treatment groups. Reliable change index methods demonstrated that nearly a half of patients showed an improvement in Global Cognitive Score at the 6-month assessment. Improvement on the neuropsychological tests ranged from 17 to 54%. A strong predictor of cognitive response was poor performance on baseline neuropsychological tests; response was moderately influenced by a low premorbid scholastic performance and IQ. Conclusions: Cognitive improvement related to second-generation antipsychotic drugs appeared within the first 4 weeks of treatment and persisted at 6 months irrespective of treatment group. Greater cognitive dysfunction at baseline and lower premorbid cognitive background predicted cognitive improvement in our sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Introduction: Schizophrenia is a life‐long neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by significant alterations in patient's thoughts, behaviour, mood and perception. Diagnosis and treatment start from the early stage of schizophrenia that is predominantly characterized by positive and negative symptoms with high levels of hostility, lasting up to 5 years. As successful treatment in this period is necessary to prevent relapse into a second episode, finding the right antipsychotic medication is crucial. Cariprazine, a potent dopamine D3/D2 receptor partial agonist was found to be generally safe and effective in the treatment of acute schizophrenia, however patients in the early stage have not been specifically analysed yet. Objectives: This poster aims to summarise the evidence of cariprazine's efficacy in the early stage of schizophrenia treatment with special focus to those symptoms that are prevalent in this period of the disorder. Methods: Data from 3 randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trials (NCT01104766, NCT01104779, NCT00694707) with identical design (1 week of wash out period, 6 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of follow‐up) were pooled. The primary efficacy measure in all studies was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). For the post‐hoc analyses, patients with early stage of schizophrenia (defined as having a disease duration of less than 5 years) were extracted from the whole IIT population, and cariprazine dose groups (1.5 mg to 6.0 mg/day) were combined. Primary efficacy was evaluated using PANSS Total Scores. In addition, PANSS‐derived Marder Factor groupings relevant to this disease stage (Positive, Negative and Uncontrolled Hostility/Excitement Symptom Factor scores) were analysed. Change from baseline in total and factor scores were evaluated based on least squares mean differences (LSMDs) between cariprazine and placebo using a mixed‐effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. Results: Overall, 143 placebo and 304 cariprazine treated patients were identified as having schizophrenia for less than 5 years. In this population, cariprazine was significantly superior to placebo on PANSS total score. At week 6, patients on cariprazine treatment showed a least square mean (LSM) change of ‐24.2 from baseline, and an LSMD of ‐6.28 (95% CI: ‐10.30 to ‐2.26; p=0.002) compared to placebo. Decreases in Marder Positive Symptom Factor scores were significantly greater in the cariprazine group versus placebo; at week 6 the LSM change from baseline was ‐7.92 (LSMD: ‐1.86; 95% CI: ‐3.33 to ‐0.39; p=0.013). A significant decrease of ‐5.45 from baseline to week 6 in the Marder Negative Symptom Factor scores was also detected, with an LSMD of ‐2.01 (95% CI: ‐3.18 to ‐1.00; p<0.001) compared to placebo. Finally, the Marder Uncontrolled Hostility/Excitement Factor scores also decreased from baseline significantly versus placebo, with an LSM change of ‐2.59 (LSMD: ‐0.99; 95% CI: ‐1.79 to ‐0.20; p=0.014) at week 6 in patients on cariprazine treatment. Conclusion: Cariprazine was efficacious in treating patients in the early stage of schizophrenia. Significant efficacy was observed in the overall symptomatology, as well as in the positive, negative and hostility‐related symptoms which are highly characteristic in this period of the disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive remediation (CR) preceding cognitive‐behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp) was trialled within routine clinical services, with the hypothesis that following first‐episode non‐affective psychosis CR would enhance CBTp efficacy by improving neuropsychological performance. METHOD: A total of 61 patients with DSM‐IV non‐affective psychoses waiting for routine CBTp were randomized to computerized CR over 12 weeks, supported by a trained support worker, or time‐matched social contact (SC). Primary outcome was the blind‐rated Psychotic Symptoms Rating Scale (PSYRATS). Secondary outcomes included measures of CBTp progress, cognition, symptoms, insight and self‐esteem: all at baseline, after CR (12 weeks) and after CBTp (42 weeks). PSYRATS and global neuropsychological efficacy were tested using mixed‐effects models with a group × time interaction term. Measures of CBTp progress and some neuropsychological measures were modelled by regression. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the CR and SC groups in PSYRATS (group × time coefficient 0.3, 95% confidence interval ‐0.4 to 1.1, p = 0.39). However, after CR CBTp was shorter [median 7 sessions, interquartile range (IQR) 2‐12 after CR; median 13, IQR 4‐18 after SC; model p = 0.011] and linked to better insight (p = 0.02). Global cognition did not improve significantly more after CR (p = 0.20) but executive function did (Wisconsin Card Sort, p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: CBTp courses preceded by CR were far shorter but achieved the same outcome as CBTp preceded by an active control, consistent with neuropsychological improvement enhancing CBTp. CR was delivered by staff with minimal training, offering the potential to reduce the costs of CBTp considerably.

AB  - Here we report the results of a pilot study investigating the relative and combined effects of a 12 week course of clozapine and CBT in first‐episode psychosis patients with prominent ongoing positive symptoms following their initial treatment. Patients from our early psychosis service who met the inclusion criteria (n = 48) were randomized to one of four treatment groups: clozapine, clozapine plus CBT, thioridazine, or thioridazine plus CBT. The degree of psychopathology and functionality of all participants was measured at baseline then again at 6, 12 and 24 weeks, and the treatment outcomes for each group determined by statistical analysis. A substantial proportion (52) of those treated with clozapine achieved symptomatic remission, as compared to 35 of those who were treated with thioridazine. Overall, those who received clozapine responded more rapidly to treatment than those receiving the alternative treatments. Interestingly, during the early treatment phase CBT appeared to reduce the intensity of both positive and negative symptoms and thus the time taken to respond to treatment, as well having as a stabilizing effect over time. © 2011 J.

AB  - First‐episode psychosis (FEP) is the first presentation of a psychotic disorder that usually propagates during early adulthood. FEP represents an important early intervention point to attenuate the metabolic risks associated with psychosis and its treatment. Exercise has potential to improve metabolic and functional outcome, but engaging this population in regular exercise is typically difficult. Promoting enjoyment and attendance may improve participation. 22 men with FEP were randomised to a 12‐week intervention of exercise training, or treatment as usual. Exercise was pre‐standardised based on measures of heart rate to assess intensity. Symptoms of psychosis were assessed, alongside measures of quality of life, disability and habitual activity. The study observed 83% attendance at exercise sessions, with target intensity attained. There were clinically meaningful decreases in PANSS positive (17.31%) and general psychopathology (10.98%) scores and exercise was protective of negative score increase observed in the control group (13.89%). Assessment of disability declined after training (12.65%) compared with a 20.78% increase in controls. This study demonstrated that engagement of FEP patients in an intervention of high quality exercise was possible. Positive changes in psychopathology scores and disability show that the benefits of regular exercise are achievable with a potential positive impact on clinical presentation.

AB  - Background: Ethical early intervention in psychosis requires careful consideration of the risk:benefit ratio of treatments recommendations, especially the role of interventions with significant unpleasant side‐effects. The STAGES Study aims to investigate whether intensive psychosocial treatment and close monitoring in a specialised early psychosis service, without antipsychotic medication, constitutes an effective treatment for a selected sub‐group of young people with FEP. Methodology: Young people entering the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Melbourne are screened for study eligibility and are invited to participate if they meet stringent inclusion criteria indicating low‐risk of harm to self or others, and adequate social support. Participants are randomly assigned to receive either low dose antipsychotic medication or placebo for six months, and all participants receive intensive psychosocial treatment in the form of cognitive behavioural case management. Assessments of psychopathology and neurocognitive performance, and neuroimaging occurs regularly until two years after study entry. Clinicians, participants and research staff remain blind to treatment allocation until the conclusion of the study. Results: The study is ongoing with recruitment scheduled to conclude late in 2016. Over 70 young people (mean age 18.6 years, 45% male) with a range of psychotic disorder diagnoses have entered the study to date, demonstrating that the study is feasible and acceptable. This presentation will outline the study design and the baseline characteristics of participants. Conclusion: This challenging study promises to contribute rich data about the impact of various treatments offered for first episode psychosis, and to further knowledge about factors affecting recovery.

AB  - There are risks associated with the use of antipsychotic medication (AP). These include adverse neurological and metabolic effects and measurable changes in brain structure. APs may even be associated with poorer functional recovery. The STAGES Study is a noninferiority design randomised double blind placebo controlled study that examines whether a subgroup of people with FEP can recover without AP, and considers the effects on functioning, physical health, cognition, and brain structure of AP versus withholding AP. Young people with FEP were screened for study eligibility and recruited if they met stringent inclusion criteria indicating low‐risk of harm to self or others, and adequate social support. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either low dose AP (MIPT group) or placebo (PIPT group) for six months, and all participants received intensive psychosocial treatment. Ninety young people (mean age 18.5 years) were randomised and 81 commenced trial medication. Thirty‐four percent of participants completed the six month medication phase and there were more completers in the placebo group than the medication group. On the primary outcome measure of SOFAS there was significant evidence that the placebo group was not inferior to the medication group (SOFAS: MIPT mean = 61.5, SD = 13.4; PIPT mean = 61.7, SD = 16.8). The two groups were found to be very similar on all psychopathology assessments and measures of functioning at both baseline and following treatment, suggesting that the outcomes of the two treatment regimes were not different with respect to symptoms and functioning.

AB  - This triple-blind (participants, clinicians, and researchers) randomized controlled noninferiority trial examined whether intensive psychosocial intervention (cognitive-behavioral case management, CBCM) for first-episode psychosis (FEP) in 15–25 year-olds managed in a specialized early intervention for psychosis service was noninferior to usual treatment of antipsychotic medication plus CBCM delivered during the first 6 months of treatment. To maximize safety, participants were required to have low levels of suicidality and aggression, a duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) of less than 6 months, and be living in stable accommodation with social support. The primary outcome was level of functioning as assessed by the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) at 6 months. Ninety young people were randomized by computer, 46 to placebo, and 44 antipsychotic medication and 33% of those who commenced trial medication completed the entire 6-month trial period. On the SOFAS, both groups improved, and group differences were small and clinically trivial, indicating that treatment with placebo medication was no less effective than conventional antipsychotic treatment (mean difference = −0.2, 2-sided 95% confidence interval = −7.5 to 7.0, t = 0.060, P = .95). Within the context of a specialized early intervention service, and with a short DUP, the immediate introduction of antipsychotic medication may not be required for all cases of FEP in order to see functional improvement. However, this finding can only be generalized to a very small proportion of FEP cases at this stage, and a larger trial is required to clarify whether antipsychotic-free treatment can be recommended for specific subgroups of those with FEP.Trial Registration: ACTRN12607000608460 (www.anzctr.org.au).

AB  - AIM: We aimed to test the idea that there is an early critical time period during a psychotic illness when patients may be more responsive to psychological treatment attention. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis by comparing the treatment responsiveness to group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) of 25 first‐episode psychosis participants (FEP) and 15 patients with currently stable psychosis (n = 40). RESULTS: Following 12 sessions of outpatient‐based group CBT, there were significant decreases in positive, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and an improvement in quality of life for both groups. However, negative symptoms only improved in the FEP group. CONCLUSION: Considering the pernicious nature of negative symptoms as well as the difficulties in treating them, this study provides some support for the concept of early intervention with CBT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with first‐episode psychosis are responsive to acute‐phase treatments, but relapse rates are high. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychosocial treatment designed to prevent the second episode of psychosis compared with standardized early psychosis care. METHOD: In a randomized controlled trial, conducted at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre and Barwon Health, Australia, a multimodal individual and family cognitive‐behavioral therapy for relapse prevention was compared with standardized case management within a specialist early psychosis service. Patients aged 15 to 25 years with a first episode of a DSM‐IV psychotic disorder were recruited between November 2003 and May 2005. The main outcome measures were the number of relapses and time to first relapse. RESULTS: Forty‐one first‐episode psychosis patients were randomly assigned to the relapse prevention therapy (RPT) and 40 to standardized case management. At the 7‐month follow up, the relapse rate was significantly lower in the therapy condition compared to treatment as usual (p = .042) and time to relapse was significantly longer for the RPT condition (p = .03). The number needed to treat was 6 over 7 months. CONCLUSIONS: Interim findings suggest that RPT provided within a specialist early psychosis program was effective in reducing relapse in early psychosis when compared with standardized early psychosis case management.

AB  - The effectiveness of a novel 7‐month psychosocial treatment designed to prevent the second episode of psychosis was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial at 2 specialist first‐episode psychosis (FEP) programs. An individual and family cognitive behavior therapy for relapse prevention was compared with specialist FEP care. Forty‐one FEP patients were randomized to the relapse prevention therapy (RPT) and 40 to specialist FEP care. Participants were assessed on an array of measures at baseline, 7‐ (end of therapy), 12‐, 18‐, 24‐, and 30‐month follow‐up. At 12‐month follow‐up, the relapse rate was significantly lower in the therapy condition compared with specialized treatment alone (P = .039), and time to relapse was significantly delayed for those in the relapse therapy condition (P = .038); however, such differences were not maintained. Unexpectedly, psychosocial functioning deteriorated over time in the experimental but not in the control group; these differences were no longer statistically significant when between‐group differences in medication adherence were included in the model. Further research is required to ascertain if the initial treatment effect of the RPT can be sustained. Further research is needed to investigate if medication adherence contributes to negative outcomes in functioning in FEP patients who have reached remission, or, alternatively, if a component of RPT is detrimental.

AB  - Background: The quality of the therapeutic alliance (TA) has been invoked to explain the equal effectiveness of different psychotherapies, but prior research is correlational, and does not address the possibility that individuals who form good alliances may have good outcomes without therapy. Before the 1990's, psychological therapies for people with psychosis and schizophrenia were widely held to be ineffective and potentially harmful. Since then, meta‐analyses of the many randomized controlled trials have indicated that CBT delivered in addition to routine care is more effective in improving symptoms than routine care alone. However, these trials often report positive results for non‐specific psychological therapies (counselling, befriending) used as controls, which also turn out to be better than routine care alone. Methods: We evaluated the causal effect of TA using instrumental variable (structural equation) modelling on data from a three‐arm, randomized controlled trial of 308 people in an acute first (80%) or second (20%) episode of a non‐affective psychosis. Patients aged 21‐35 were recruited (67% male). The trial compared CBT over 6 weeks plus routine care (RC) versus supportive counseling plus RC versus RC alone. Subjects met DSM 4 criteria for schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. Follow‐up rates were high (73%). We examined the effect of TA, as measured by the clientrated CALPAS, on the primary trial 18 month outcome of symptom severity (PANSS), which was assessed blind to treatment allocation. Results: Both adjunctive CBT and SC improved 18 month outcomes, compared to RC . We showed that, for both psychological treatments, improving TA improves symptomatic outcome. With a good TA, attending more sessions causes a significantly better outcome on the PANSS total (effect size ‐2.91, 95% confidence interval ‐0.90 to ‐4.91), With a poor TA, attending more sessions is detrimental (effect size +7.74, 95% confidence interval +1.03 to +14.45). Conclusion: This is the first ever demonstration that therapeutic alliance has a causal effect on symptomatic outcome of a psychological treatment, and that poor TA is actively detrimental. This has implications for training and quality assurance, at least with respect to psychosis. These effects may extend to other therapeutic modalities and disorders.

AB  - Background: There is a critical period, the first 5 years after the onset of the illness, that is a indicator of long‐term outcome and where first episode psychosis patients (FEP) are more likely to relapse. Patients in this period are also more responsive to treatment than in later stages of the illness. It is therefore, the period in which it is essential to treat early FEP patients to prevent the relapses and reduce the disability of the disease [1,2]. Early psychosocial interventions adjunctive to pharmacotherapy may contribute to symptomatic and functional recovery of FEP. Therefore, individuals who receive early intervention including guidance on how to improve their adherence to treatment, insight into their illness and self‐management, have a better course and, hence, these factors are associated with a better prognosis. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of a psychoeducation programme versus treatment as usual in improving the symptomatology and functionality of patients (pre/post‐treatment). Methods: This is a single‐blind randomised clinical trial in which FEP patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 1) the control group, receiving pharmacotherapy together with regular sessions with a psychiatrist (treatment as usual), and 2) the intervention group receiving integrated treatment, namely treatment as usual plus a psychoeducational intervention. The sample was composed by 177 FEP patients (86 were assigned to intervention group and 91 to control group). The psychoeducational programme has 16 sessions focused on improving patient insight into their illness, treatment adherence, prodromal identification, early intervention to prevent relapses, healthy lifestyles, techniques for managing anxiety, social skills and problem solving. Patients can also call a telephone helpline between sessions. Patients were assessed at baseline and at post‐treatment. Psychotic symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Hamilton Depresion Ranting Scale (HDRS) was used to assess the severity and change of depressive symptomatology. The overall function of patients was measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was used to assess the attitudes of the patients towards their treatment. Univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were conducted to analyse the differences between groups in terms of clinical and functional outcomes at postreatment. Results: There was a significant decrease of the positive (B=‐1,641; p=0,008), negative (B=‐2,138; p=0,001) and general (B=‐2,002; p=0,0037) psychotic symptoms in patients of the intervention group compared to patients who received TAU. A significant improvement in psychosocial functioning was also found in patients of the intervention group (B=11,024; p=0,000). The intervention group also had a better adherence compared to the TAU group (OR = 3,128; p = 0.001). Conclusions: Early intervention based on an integrated treatment that includes a psychoeducational program adjunctive to pharmacological treatment, may be beneficial for improving clinical and functional outcomes of FEP patients. Specifically, psychoeducation may be effective in improving treatment adherence, psychotic symptoms and global functioning.

AB  - It is wellknown that environmental stress and substance abuse may contribute to the clinical morbidity
of persons with schizophrenia. In a randomized and controlled outpatient treatment study of recent
onset schizophrenia, patients receiving supposed optimal multimodal treatment was contrasted with
patients receiving treatment-as-usual (TAU), i.e., non-standardized case-management and follow-up.
The optimal multimodal treatment strategies emphasized neuroleptic treatment, family psychoeduca-
tion, family communicational, problem solving and stress management training, and individualized
psychotherapy. A Psychoses Team, located at the hospital, offered extensive outreach services and a
comprehensive community management program to patients, frequently living far away from the
hospital. It was hypothesized that the addition of integrated drug and intensive psychosocial interven-
tion strategies would facilitate long-term clinical and social recovery. The study is a local center in the
international multicenter studt The Optimal Treatment Project of Schizophrenia (5 years treatment),
led by Professor Ian RH Falloon. Preliminary l and (n=35) 2 year (n=l7) results will be presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychological treatments have been shown to be effective in patients with psychosis. However, the studies published to date have included participants across wide age ranges, so few conclusions can be reached about the effectiveness of such treatments in relation to age. AIMS: To evaluate outcomes by age in a randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive‐behavioural therapy (CBT), supportive counselling and treatment as usual. METHOD: Outcomes were evaluated in terms of symptoms, social functioning, insight and therapeutic alliance according to age at 3‐ and 18‐month follow‐up. RESULTS: Younger participants responded better to supportive counselling than to treatment as usual and CBTover 3 months. Older participants responded better to CBT than to supportive counselling over 18 months. Younger participants showed a greater increase in insight after CBT compared with treatment as usual and supportive counselling, and were more difficult to engage in therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Young people may have different needs with regard to engagement in psychological treatments. Treatment providers need to take age‐specific factors into account.

AB  - Background: Young people with mental illness, especially those with firstepisode psychosis (FEP), nominate employment as a number one goal. Despite this in most places, young people with psychosis have high rates of unemployment at entry to service and these rates increase rapidly. Individual placement and support (IPS) is an employment intervention with a growing evidence base in FEP. Method: IPS was compared to high‐quality early psychosis treatment as usual (TAU) for 146 young people attending an FEP clinic in Melbourne, Australia. Assessments were conducted a four time points baseline, 6 months (end of intervention) and 18 months. Results: The IPS group achieved higher employment and education rates, although this was only significant for employment at 6 months end of intervention (71.6% vs 47.5%, p = 0.005). Interestingly, the control group achieved outcomes that mimic IPS intervention groups in other RCTs. Results were maintained across the follow‐up period with 52.5% and 64.2% in the TAU and IPS groups, respectively. When education was factored in 75.4%, and 81.8% of the TAU and IPS groups, respectively, were either in education, training or employment at 18 months. Conclusion : IPS produced a significant early benefit in terms of employment. This advantage was lost over time, however. Overall, participants in both groups had outcomes significantly better than those in routine early psychosis settings and those in non‐specialised mental health settings.

AB  - Aims: Ongoing NICE guidance recommends research on the clinical and cost effectiveness of psychological treatment alone, compared to antipsychotic medication and compared to psychological treatment and antipsychotic medication combined. The COMPARE study (Cognitive behaviour therapy or Medication for Psychosis- A Randomised Evaluation) was a pilot trial designed to inform a definitive trial to answer this question. Method: COMPARE was a single-site pilot randomised controlled trial to compare a standardised Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) intervention to treatment with antipsychotic medication (APs) and a combined treatment (CBT plus APs) in adults with psychosis. Participants were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and followed up at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks. The primary outcomes were recruitment and retention of participants. We surveyed a wider population of staff and service users to further inform feasibility of a definitive trial. Results: We report the characteristics of the recruited sample at baseline (n = 75) and results from surveys. Conclusions: The study recruited to target demonstrating it is feasible to identify and recruit participants to a study of this kind. The survey results also suggest that such trials are feasible.

AB  - Aims: Evaluate the effectiveness of MIRA (Multimodal Intervention to Raise the Adherence), a brief group intervention for First Episode Psychosis patients, designed to delay the next episode by targeting factors associated to nonadherence. Methods: The design is a randomized controlled trial of parallel groups. 90 stabilized FEP patients between 16 and 35 years old will be randomly assigned to the MIRA intervention group or the control group (treatment as usual). The intervention will consist of five weekly group sessions of 10 patients and include psychoeducation, one session with relatives, progressive muscle relaxation, and other techniques from motivational interviewing and cognitive‐behavioral therapy. Other modalities of the intervention are text messages (reminders of the sessions), emails (including videos and links) and a closed forum on Internet. Outcome assessments will be performed on a 1‐year period (at 3, 6 and 12 months). The main outcome is the time until relapse (hospitalization or evaluation by the psychiatrist). Other outcomes include: adherence to treatment (in %, self‐rated and by psychiatrist), Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), and the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). The two groups will be compared on all outcomes at different time points. A survival analysis will be performed to evaluate the time to relapse. Approval from the Ethics Committee of UNIFESP has been requested and is awaited in the next weeks. Each patients will have to sign a written informed consent to be included in the study. As soon as approval is released the study will start, and results are expected for 2016 or beginning of 2017.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive remediation (CR) is an effective treatment for several psychiatric disorders. To date, there have been no published studies examining solely first‐episode psychiatric cohorts, despite the merits demonstrated by early intervention CR studies. The current study aimed to assess the effectiveness of CR in patients with a first‐episode of either major depression or psychosis. Method Fifty‐five patients (mean age = 22.8 years, s.d. = 4.3) were randomly assigned to either CR (n = 28) or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 27). CR involved once‐weekly 2‐h sessions for a total of 10 weeks. Patients were comprehensively assessed before and after treatment. Thirty‐six patients completed the study, and analyses were conducted using an intent‐to‐treat (ITT) approach with all available data. RESULTS: In comparison to TAU, CR was associated with improved immediate learning and memory controlling for diagnosis and baseline differences. Similarly, CR patients demonstrated greater improvements than TAU patients in psychosocial functioning irrespective of diagnosis. Delayed learning and memory improvements mediated the effect of treatment on psychosocial functioning at a marginal level. CONCLUSIONS: CR improves memory and psychosocial outcome in first‐episode psychiatric out‐patients for both depression and psychosis. Memory potentially mediated the functional gains observed. Future studies need to build on the current findings in larger samples using blinded allocation and should incorporate longitudinal follow‐up and assessment of potential moderators (e.g. social cognition, self‐efficacy) to examine sustainability and the precise mechanisms of CR effects respectively.

AB  - Objective: The objective was to identify the causal mechanism of change in psychotherapies for psychosis. Before the 1990's, psychotherapies for psychosis were considered to be ineffective and potentially harmful. Since then, meta‐analyses of many randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that CBT in addition to routine care (RC) reduces symptoms more than RC alone. These trials often report that non‐specific psychotherapies (counselling, befriending) used as controls are also more effective than RC alone. The quality of the therapeutic alliance has been invoked to explain the equal effectiveness of different psychotherapies, but prior research is correlational, and ignores the possibility that individuals who form good alliances may have good outcomes without therapy. Methods: We evaluated the causal effect of therapeutic alliance using instrumental variable (structural equation) modelling on data from a three‐arm, randomized controlled trial of 308 people in an acute first or second episode of non‐affective psychosis. The trial compared CBT over 6 weeks plus RC versus supportive counseling plus RC versus RC alone. We examined the effect of therapeutic alliance, measured by the client‐rated CALPAS, on the primary trial 18‐month outcome of symptom severity (PANSS), assessed blind to treatment allocation. Results: Both adjunctive CBT and SC improved 18 month outcomes, compared to RC. For both psychotherapies, improving therapeutic alliance improved symptomatic outcome. With a good therapeutic alliance, attending more sessions causes a significantly better PANSS total outcome (effect size i.e., change in treatment effect (PANSS score) per session attended ‐2.91, 95 % CI ‐0.90 to ‐4.91), With a poor therapeutic alliance, attending more sessions is detrimental (effect size +7.74, 95 % CI +1.03 to +14.45). Conclusion: This is the first ever demonstration that therapeutic alliance has a causal effect on symptomatic outcome, and that poor therapeutic alliance is actively detrimental. This has implications for training and quality assurance, at least with respect to psychosis.

AB  - Background: Impairments of attention and memory are detectable in early psychosis, and often result in severe, longstanding functional impairments. Pharmacological interventions for cognitive impairments have been largely unsuccessful. The current study aims to explore the effects of aerobic exercise and mind‐body exercise (yoga) on cognitive functioning and clinical symptoms in female patients with early psychosis. The potential neuromechanism underlying the clinical consequences was also investigated. Methods: Female patients (n=120) diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, brief psychosis, psychosis NOS, or delusional disorder (according to SCID) were recruited from three hospital/clinic sites. They were randomized into integrated yoga therapy group, aerobic exercise programme group and waiting list as the control group. Both interventions were held three times weekly. At baseline and at 12 weeks, clinical symptoms, cognitive functions, quality of life and fitness levels were assessed in all participants and completed structural MRI data were collected in 58 patients. Repeated measures ANOVA and ANCOVA analyses of the clinical, cognitive, quality of life and fitness data were compared between baseline and at 12 weeks among the three groups. Post‐hoc Bonferroni test was used for comparing between two groups. Structural MRI data was analyzed by FreeSurfer V5.1 and Qdec V1.4 to calculate the brain volume and cortical thickness. Results: Completed clinical and cognitive data were collected in 85 patients and completed MRI imaging data of good quality were collected in 39 patients. No significant differences in age, education years, and duration of the illness at baseline were observed among the three groups. Both yoga and aerobic exercise groups demonstrated significant improvements in verbal encoding (p<0.01), short‐term memory (p<0.05), long‐term memory (p<0.01), and working memory (p<0.01) with moderate to large effect sizes compared to control groups. The yoga group showed significantly enhanced attention and concentration (p<0.05). Both yoga and aerobic exercise significantly improved overall clinical symptoms (p<0.05) and depressive symptoms (p<0.05) after 12 weeks. Significant increases were observed in the thickness of the left superior frontal gyrus and the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars triangularis) in the aerobic exercise group. Significant increases were observed in the volume of the postcentral gyrus and the posterior corpus callosum in the yoga group. There was a statistically significant correlation between improvements in working memory and changes in the postcentral gyrus (r=0.54, p<0.01) after controlling for the multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni adjusted alpha level. Discussion: Both types of exercise improved memory in early psychosis patients, with yoga having a superior effect on attention than aerobic exercise. Observed increments in the cortical thicknesses and volume may indicate improved neurogenesis.

AB  - Background: Impairments of attention and memory are evident in early psychosis, and often lead to severe, longstanding functional disability. Effective non‐pharmacological interventions are needed due to the unsuccessful results of pharmacological interventions. Aims: To determine whether yoga is effective for cognitive impairments, and the neural mechanism underlying these effects. Methods: It was a randomized controlled study of 12‐week of yoga and aerobic exercise (walking and cycling) intervention vs wait‐list control for female early psychotic patients. Memory was measured with Hong Kong List Learning Test and Digit Span test, and attention was measured with Letter Cancellation test. Cognitive data analysis was based on the Intention‐to‐Treat method using a mixed‐model analysis. Seed based functional connectivity was applied using posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) as seed with AFNI. Cortical thickness analyses were performed using FreeSurfer. Results from yoga and control groups were presented. Results: A total of 140 women were recruited and randomized into three groups. 95 completed the study, and 115 were included for cognitive data analysis. For imaging data, 42 participants were used for cortical thickness analyses; and 60 were included for neural connectivity analyses. Yoga group demonstrated significant improvements in working memory, verbal acquisition and attention (P=.01). Cortical thickness increased in the postcentral gyrus (P<.01); connectivity between PCC and bilateral inferior parietal gyrus increased after yoga intervention (P<.005). Conclusions: Yoga has been found to be effective for memory and attention in early psychotic patients. The increases of thickness and neural connectivity indicate the possible neural mechanisms underlying the improvements of cognition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Specialized Early Intervention services (SEI) for first episode psychosis are shown to be effective for the treatment of positive and negative symptoms, medication adherence, rates of relapse, substance abuse disorders, functional outcome and quality of life at two‐year treatment follow up. However, it is also reported that these benefits are not maintained when SEI is not sustained. The objective of this trial is to test the efficacy of a 3‐year extension of a SEI service (following 2 years of SEI prior to randomization) for the maintenance and consolidation of therapeutic gains as compared to regular care in the community. METHODS: Following an initial 2 years of SEI, patients are randomized to receive either 3‐years of continued SEI or regular care. SEI provided at three sites within the McGill network of SEI services, using a model of treatment comprised of: modified assertive case management; psycho education for families; multiple family intervention; cognitive behavioural therapy; and substance abuse treatment and monitoring. Blinded research assistants conduct ongoing evaluation of the outcome variables every three months. The primary outcome measure is remission status measured both as the proportion of patients in complete remission and the mean length of remission achieved following randomization during the additional three years of follow up. Based on preliminary data, it is determined that a total of 212 patients are needed to achieve adequate statistical power. Intent to treat with the last observation carried forward will be the primary method of statistical analysis. DISCUSSION: The "critical period" hypothesis posits that there is a five year window during which the effects of the nascent psychotic illness can be countered and the impact of the disorder on symptomatic and functional outcomes can be offset through active and sustained treatment. Providing SEI throughout this critical period may solidify the benefits of treatment such that gains may be more sustainable over time as compared to intervention delivered for a shorter period. Findings from this study will have implications for service provision in first episode psychosis. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN11889976.

AB  - Aim: To assess the feasibility of a randomized pilot trial that evaluated the acceptability and potential clinical utility of the Mindfulness Ambassador Program (MAP), a unique, standardized 12-session facilitated group mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for youth experiencing early psychosis. Methods: Twenty-one patients of an early psychosis intervention program were randomized to receive MAP (n = 11) or treatment as usual (n = 10). Acceptability was measured by group attendance rate and client satisfaction; feasibility of the study design was measured by the recruitment and retention rate. The means, standard deviations, and 95% confidence intervals were described for outcomes of interest. Results: MAP is associated with a high degree of acceptability and has beneficial effects for depression and fatigue. The randomized trial design is feasible. Conclusions: This study provides important pilot data supporting a larger randomized trial of effectiveness for MAP as a group MBI for early psychosis. Details of MAP and study limitations are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: While antipsychotic medication (AP) is a very effective treatment for positive psychotic symptoms in first‐episode psychosis (FEP), it is also associated with risks. These include adverse neurological and metabolic effects and measurable changes in brain structure. APs may even be associated with poorer functional recovery. Due to advances in the detection of, and psychosocial treatments for FEP, it is now ethically feasible to study the relative risks and benefits of offering AP as a first line treatment, and conversely, of withholding it, on a background of comprehensive evidence‐based psychosocial care. This non‐inferiority design randomised double blind placebo controlled study examines whether a (low‐risk) subgroup of people with FEP can recover without AP, and considers the effects on functioning, physical health, cognition, and brain structure of AP versus withholding AP. Methods: Young people with FEP were screened for study eligibility and invited to participate if they met stringent inclusion criteria indicating low‐risk of harm to self or others, and adequate social support. Hence a large proportion of patients were assumed a priori to be too high risk to withhold antipsychotic medication. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either low dose AP (MIPT group) or placebo (PIPT group) for six months, and all participants received intensive psychosocial treatment. Randomisation was stratified with three levels of DUP and gender creating six cells. Assessments of psychopathology, neurocognitive performance, and neuroimaging occurred regularly until two years after study entry. Results: 90 young people were randomised and 81 commenced trial medication. They were 44% male and mean age 18.5 years (SD = 2.7). Thirtyfour percent of participants completed the six month medication phase and there were more completers in the placebo group than the medication group. On the primary outcome measure of SOFAS there was significant evidence that the placebo group was not inferior to the medication group (SOFAS: MIPT mean = 61.5, SD = 13.4; PIPT mean = 61.7, SD = 16.8). The two groups were found to be very similar on all psychopathology assessments and measures of functioning at both baseline and following treatment, suggesting that the outcomes of the two treatment regimes were not different with respect to symptoms and functioning. Discussion: The results of this study demonstrate that it is feasible and acceptable to conduct AP‐free research in carefully selected FEP to examine the risk‐benefit ratio of current treatments under carefully controlled conditions that prioritise patient outcomes and safety. Although only one‐third of the participants completed the six month trial intervention period, more of those on placebo completed the trial phase and they had higher mean, minimum and maximum time in the experimental intervention phase than those on medication. In addition, there were no differences between the groups on measures of psychopathology and functioning, suggesting that the intensive psychosocial intervention provided to all participants is complementary and may be more important than antipsychotic medication in the early phases of psychotic illness for a subgroup of young people. However this subgroup is very small as a % of total FEP patients treated during the study period. Further analysis of physical health and neuroimaging data and completion of the 24 month follow‐up assessments will allow detailed examination of the risk‐benefit ratio regarding antipsychotic medication in FEP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Little evidence is available for head-to-head comparisons of psychosocial interventions and pharmacological interventions in psychosis. We aimed to establish whether a randomised controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus antipsychotic drugs versus a combination of both would be feasible in people with psychosis. METHODS: We did a single-site, single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial in people with psychosis who used services in National Health Service trusts across Greater Manchester, UK. Eligible participants were aged 16 years or older; met ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder, or met the entry criteria for an early intervention for psychosis service; were in contact with mental health services, under the care of a consultant psychiatrist; scored at least 4 on delusions or hallucinations items, or at least 5 on suspiciousness, persecution, or grandiosity items on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS); had capacity to consent; and were help-seeking. Participants were assigned (1:1:1) to antipsychotics, CBT, or antipsychotics plus CBT. Randomisation was done via a secure web-based randomisation system (Sealed Envelope), with randomised permuted blocks of 4 and 6, stratified by gender and first episode status. CBT incorporated up to 26 sessions over 6 months plus up to four booster sessions. Choice and dose of antipsychotic were at the discretion of the treating consultant. Participants were followed up for 1 year. The primary outcome was feasibility (ie, data about recruitment, retention, and acceptability), and the primary efficacy outcome was the PANSS total score (assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 52 weeks). Non-neurological side-effects were assessed systemically with the Antipsychotic Non-neurological Side Effects Rating Scale. Primary analyses were done by intention to treat; safety analyses were done on an as-treated basis. The study was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN06022197. FINDINGS: Of 138 patients referred to the study, 75 were recruited and randomly assigned-26 to CBT, 24 to antipsychotics, and 25 to antipsychotics plus CBT. Attrition was low, and retention high, with only four withdrawals across all groups. 40 (78%) of 51 participants allocated to CBT attended six or more sessions. Of the 49 participants randomised to antipsychotics, 11 (22%) were not prescribed a regular antipsychotic. Median duration of total antipsychotic treatment was 44·5 weeks (IQR 26-51). PANSS total score was significantly reduced in the combined intervention group compared with the CBT group (-5·65 [95% CI -10·37 to -0·93]; p=0·019). PANSS total scores did not differ significantly between the combined group and the antipsychotics group (-4·52 [95% CI -9·30 to 0·26]; p=0·064) or between the antipsychotics and CBT groups (-1·13 [95% CI -5·81 to 3·55]; p=0·637). Significantly fewer side-effects, as measured with the Antipsychotic Non-neurological Side Effects Rating Scale, were noted in the CBT group than in the antipsychotics (3·22 [95% CI 0·58 to 5·87]; p=0·017) or antipsychotics plus CBT (3·99 [95% CI 1·36 to 6·64]; p=0·003) groups. Only one serious adverse event was thought to be related to the trial (an overdose of three paracetamol tablets in the CBT group). INTERPRETATION: A head-to-head clinical trial of CBT versus antipsychotics versus the combination of the two is feasible and safe in people with first-episode psychosis.

AB  - Background: Evidence for the effectiveness of treatments in early‐onset psychosis is sparse. Current guidance for the treatment of early‐onset psychosis is mostly extrapolated from trials in adult populations. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has recommended evaluation of the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs versus psychological intervention (cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT] and family intervention) versus the combination of these treatments for early‐onset psychosis. The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of antipsychotic monotherapy, psychological intervention monotherapy, and antipsychotics plus psychological intervention in adolescents with first‐episode psychosis. Methods: We did a multicentre pilot and feasibility trial according to a randomised, single‐blind, three‐arm, controlled design. We recruited participants from seven UK National Health Service Trust sites. Participants were aged 14–18 years; help‐seeking; had presented with first‐episode psychosis in the past year; were under the care of a psychiatrist; were showing current psychotic symptoms; and met ICD‐10 criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder, or met the entry criteria for an early intervention for psychosis service. Participants were assigned (1:1:1) to antipsychotics, psychological intervention (CBT with optional family intervention), or antipsychotics plus psychological intervention. Randomisation was via a web‐based randomisation system, with permuted blocks of random size, stratified by centre and family contact. CBT incorporated up to 26 sessions over 6 months plus up to four booster sessions, and family intervention incorporated up to six sessions over 6 months. Choice and dose of antipsychotic were at the discretion of the treating consultant psychiatrist. Participants were followed up for a maximum of 12 months. The primary outcome was feasibility (ie, data on trial referral and recruitment, session attendance or medication adherence, retention, and treatment acceptability) and the proposed primary efficacy outcome was total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at 6 months. Primary outcomes were analysed by intention to treat. Safety outcomes were reported according to as‐treated status, for all patients who had received at least one session of CBT or family intervention, or at least one dose of antipsychotics. The study was prospectively registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN80567433. Findings: Of 101 patients referred to the study, 61 patients (mean age 16·3 years [SD 1·3]) were recruited from April 10, 2017, to Oct 31, 2018, 18 of whom were randomly assigned to psychological intervention, 22 to antipsychotics, and 21 to antipsychotics plus psychological intervention. The trial recruitment rate was 68% of our target sample size of 90 participants. The study had a low referral to recruitment ratio (around 2:1), a high rate of retention (51 [84%] participants retained at the 6‐month primary endpoint), a high rate of adherence to psychological intervention (defined as six or more sessions of CBT; in 32 [82%] of 39 participants in the monotherapy and combined groups), and a moderate rate of adherence to antipsychotic medication (defined as at least 6 consecutive weeks of exposure to antipsychotics; in 28 [65%] of 43 participants in the monotherapy and combined groups). Mean scores for PANSS total at the 6‐month primary endpoint were 68·6 (SD 17·3) for antipsychotic monotherapy (6·2 points lower than at randomisation), 59·8 (13·7) for psychological intervention (13·1 points lower than at randomisation), and 62·0 (15·9) for antipsychotics plus psychological intervention (13·9 points lower than at randomisation). A good clinical response at 6 months (defined as ≥50% improvement in PANSS total score) was achieved in four (22%) of 18 patients receiving antipsychotic monotherapy, five (31%) of 16 receiving psychological intervention, and five (29%) of 17 receiving antipsychotics plus psychological intervention. In as‐treated groups, serious adverse events occurred in eight [35%] of 23 patients in the combined group, two [13%] of 15 in the antipsychotics group, four [24%] of 17 in the psychological intervention group, and four [80%] of five who did not receive any treatment. No serious adverse events were considered to be related to participation in the trial. Interpretation: This trial is the first to show that a head‐to‐head clinical trial comparing psychological intervention, antipsychotics, and their combination is safe in young people with first‐episode psychosis. However, the feasibility of a larger trial is unclear because of site‐specific recruitment challenges, and amendments to trial design would be needed for an adequately powered clinical and cost‐effectiveness trial that provides robust evidence.

AB  - Background: When psychosis emerges in young people there is a risk of poorer outcomes, and access to evidence‐based treatments is paramount. The current evidence base is limited. Antipsychotic medications show only a small benefit over placebo, but young people experience more side effects than adults. There is sparse evidence for psychological intervention. Research is needed to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of psychological intervention versus antipsychotic medication versus a combined treatment for adolescents with psychosis. Objectives: The objective of Managing Adolescent first‐episode Psychosis: a feasibility Study (MAPS) was to determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial to answer the question of clinical effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of these three treatment options. Design: This was a prospective, randomised, open‐blinded, evaluation feasibility trial with a single blind. Participants were allocated 1: 1: 1 to receive antipsychotic medication, psychological intervention or a combination of both. A thematic qualitative study explored the acceptability and feasibility of the trial. Setting: Early intervention in psychosis services and child and adolescent mental health services in Manchester, Oxford, Lancashire, Sussex, Birmingham, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Northumberland, Tyne and Wear. Participants: People aged 14‐18 years experiencing a first episode of psychosis either with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis or meeting the entry criteria for early intervention in psychosis who had not received antipsychotic medication or psychological intervention within the last 3 months. Interventions: Psychological intervention involved up to 26 hours of cognitive‐behavioural therapy and six family intervention sessions over 6 months, with up to four booster sessions. Antipsychotic medication was prescribed by the participant’s psychiatrist in line with usual practice. Combined treatment was a combination of psychological intervention and antipsychotic medication. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was feasibility (recruitment, treatment adherence and retention). We used a three‐stage progression criterion to determine feasibility. Secondary outcomes were psychosis symptoms, recovery, anxiety and depression, social and educational/occupational functioning, drug and alcohol use, health economics, adverse/metabolic side effects and adverse/ serious adverse events. Results: We recruited 61 out of 90 (67.8%; amber zone) potential participants (psychological intervention, n = 18; antipsychotic medication, n = 22; combined treatment, n = 21). Retention to follow‐up was 51 out of 61 participants (83.6%; green zone). In the psychological intervention arm and the combined treatment arm, 32 out of 39 (82.1%) participants received six or more sessions of cognitive‐behavioural therapy (green zone). In the combined treatment arm and the antipsychotic medication arm, 28 out of 43 (65.1%) participants received antipsychotic medication for 6 consecutive weeks (amber zone). There were no serious adverse events related to the trial and one related adverse event. Overall, the number of completed secondary outcome measures, including health economics, was small. Limitations: Medication adherence was determined by clinician report, which can be biased. The response to secondary outcomes was low, including health economics. The small sample size obtained means that the study lacked statistical power and there will be considerable uncertainty regarding estimates of treatment effects. Conclusions: It is feasible to conduct a trial comparing psychological intervention with antipsychotic medication and a combination treatment in young people with psychosis with some adaptations to the design, including adaptations to collection of health economic data to determine cost‐effectiveness.

AB  - The primary problem to be addressed is the incomplete functional recovery following a FE of SCZ and whether CBT is an effective treatment to aid this recovery. If CBT were to positively impact recovery in the FE we then need to address (i) which mechanisms are responsible for this improvement, and (ii) whether this treatment is effective for all FE patients.

AB  - Objective: A two‐site randomised controlled trial of integrated treat‐ ment of patients 18‐45 years old with a first time diagnosis of schiz‐ ophrenia spectrum disorder was conducted in Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark. Method: The treatment consists of assertive com‐ munity treatment, psycho‐educational treatment in McFarlanes mul‐ tifamily groups and social skills training. Patients were included in the project from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2000. A total of 547 patients were included in the study. Patients were assessed compre‐ hensively (SCAN‐interviews, SAPS, SANS, Social Network‐g~ched ‐ ule, CAN, GAE Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and other vali‐ dated instruments) at baseline and at 12‐n%nth follow‐up by independent researchers. Relatives were interviewed as well and completed interviews regarding burden of illness (SBAS), knowl‐ edge of schizophrenia and satisfaction ~vith treatment. Results and conclusion: One‐year follow‐up interviews with the 547 patients were completed with 77 percent of the patients. At follow‐up assess‐ ment significantly more patients allocated to psychosis team remained in treatment, complied with antipsychotic treatment and expressed satisfaction with care as compared with patients in stan‐ dard treatment. The integrated treatment improved both positive and negative symptoms more than standard treatment after one year. Patient in integrated treatment were significantly less likely to be admitted to hospital during follow‐up periode and there was a 25 per‐ cent reduction in use of beddays in the integrated treatment group compared with the control group. More patients in integrated treat‐ ment group liveds independently. Significantly more patients in inte‐ grated treatment resumed education. Conclusions: The integrated treatment improved core psychopathology, some important domains of social functioning and satisfaction with treatment.

AB  - Background: Cognitive deficits are already evident at a first episode of schizophrenia and are strongly predictive of functional outcome. Work/ school functioning tends to be the most common domain of continuing functional impairment and is known to be linked to continuing cognitive deficit. Thus, intervention to improve cognitive functioning early in the course of schizophrenia is critical if we hope to prevent or limit long‐term disability in this disorder. Methods: We recently completed a 12‐month randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation in patients with a recent first episode of schizophrenia, using healthy behavior training as an active comparison group. A broad spectrum approach to cognitive remediation was employed, using programs emphasizing repeated practice with basic cognitive processes (processing speed, attention, immediate memory) and more complex, life‐like situations (higher‐order memory and problem solving). In addition to 2 hours/week of computerized cognitive training, cognitive remediation patients participated in a bridging group to encourage transfer to work and school situations. Patients in both treatment groups were provided supported employment/ education to encourage return to competitive work or schooling. Results: Consistent antipsychotic medication adherence was found to impact cognitive improvement in this period after a first psychotic episode, so medication adherence and protocol completion were covaried to examine cognitive remediation effects. Cognitive remediation produced significant improvement in the overall composite score and the attention/ vigilance domain from the MATRI CS Consensus Cognitive Battery, compared to healthy behavior training. Cognitive remediation also led to significantly greater improvement in work/school functioning. Cognitive improvement was significantly correlated with the degree of work/school functional improvement. Conclusion: These results indicate that cognitive remediation can significantly improve core cognitive deficits in the initial period of schizophrenia. When combined with supported employment/ education, cognitive remediation shows an impact on work/school functioning that goes beyond the facilitating effect of that compensatory work rehabilitation approach. Additional research will be needed to understand the conditions under which cognitive training can produce an impact on more individual cognitive domains and to examine ways to increase the magnitude of its effects on cognition and functional outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits at the first episode of schizophrenia are predictive of functional outcome. Interventions that improve cognitive functioning early in schizophrenia are critical if we hope to prevent or limit long-term disability in this disorder. METHODS: We completed a 12-month randomized controlled trial of cognitive remediation and of long-acting injectable (LAI) risperidone with 60 patients with a recent first episode of schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation involved programs focused on basic cognitive processes as well as more complex, life-like situations. Healthy behavior training of equal treatment time was the comparison group for cognitive remediation, while oral risperidone was the comparator for LAI risperidone in a 2 x 2 design. All patients were provided supported employment/education to encourage return to work or school. RESULTS: Both antipsychotic medication adherence and cognitive remediation contributed to cognitive improvement. Cognitive remediation was superior to healthy behavior training in the LAI medication condition but not the oral medication condition. Cognitive remediation was also superior when medication adherence and protocol completion were covaried. Both LAI antipsychotic medication and cognitive remediation led to significantly greater improvement in work/school functioning. Effect sizes were larger than in most prior studies of first-episode patients. In addition, cognitive improvement was significantly correlated with work/school functional improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that consistent antipsychotic medication adherence and cognitive remediation can significantly improve core cognitive deficits in the initial period of schizophrenia. When combined with supported employment/education, cognitive remediation and LAI antipsychotic medication show separate significant impact on improving work/school functioning.

AB  - Aim: It is now necessary to investigate whether recovery in psychosis is possible without the use of antipsychotic medication. This study will determine (1) whether a first-episode psychosis (FEP) group receiving intensive psychosocial interventions alone can achieve symptomatic remission and functional recovery; (2) whether prolonging the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) in a sub-group according to randomisation will be associated with a poorer outcome and thereby establish whether the relationship between DUP and outcome is causative; and (3) whether neurobiological changes observed in FEP are associated with the psychotic disorder or antipsychotic medication. Baseline characteristics of participants will be presented. Methods: This study is a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial. The primary outcome is the level of functioning measured by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale at 6 months. This study is being conducted at the Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne and includes young people aged 15 to 24 years with a DSM-IV psychotic disorder, a DUP less than 6 months and not high risk for suicide or harm to others. Strict discontinuation criteria are being applied. Participants are also undergoing three 3-Tesla-MRI scans. Results: Ninety participants have been recruited and baseline characteristics are presented. Conclusions: Staged treatment and acceptability guidelines in early psychosis will determine whether antipsychotic medications are indicated in all young people with a FEP and whether antipsychotic medication can be safely delayed. Furthermore, the relative contribution of psychotic illness and antipsychotic medication in terms of structural brain changes will also be elucidated. The findings will inform clinical practice guidelines. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The individual Metacognitive Training (MCT+) is useful to reduce positive symptoms in people with schizophrenia, however less is known in people with first-episode psychosis (FEP). The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of MCT+ in FEP regarding symptoms and cognitive insight. Method(s): A random clinical trial was performed with people with FEP from 10 clinical centers of Spain. One group received ten sessions of MCT+ and the other group received TAU. A total of 75 patients were included in the study, however only 40 finished the final assessment. Patients were assessed before treatment, post-treatment and 6 month follow-up. The assessment includes a battery of instruments for the main aims the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Beck Cognitive Insight (BCIS) will be analyzed. Repeated measures statistical test were used in order to assess differences between groups. Result(s): Both groups improved in Positive symptoms, in the MCT+ group the difference was 5.18 (SD=6.8) with a significance of p=0.002, while in the TAU group the difference was 3.38 (SD=4.9) with a significance of p=0.005. Regarding cognitive insight, in the MCT+ group patients improved in Self-reflectiveness, obtaining a score in baseline of 15.21 (SD=5.52) and 18 (SD=5.28) in post-treatment (p=0.017). The TAU group did not improve in any subscale of the BCIS. Discussion(s): The MCT+ seems to improve more in positive symptoms than TAU, although both interventions diminished the presence of these symptoms. The MCT+ improved the self-reflectiveness, being one of the important areas for the understanding of the daily social functioning in relation to other. Further analysis should be explored.

AB  - Background: Adolescent‐onset psychosis is associated with more severe symptoms and poorer outcomes than adult‐onset psychosis. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend that adolescents with first episode psychosis (FEP) should be offered a combination of antipsychotic medication (APs), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and family intervention (FI). The evidence for APs in treating psychosis is limited in adolescents compared to adults. Nevertheless, it indicates that APs can reduce overall symptoms in adolescents but may cause more severe side effects, including cardiovascular and metabolic effects, than in adults. CBT and FI can improve outcomes in adults, but there are no studies of psychological interventions (PI) in patients under 18 years old. Given this limited evidence base, NICE made a specific research recommendation for determining the clinical and cost effectiveness of APs versus PI versus both treatments for adolescent FEP. Methods/design: The current study aimed to establish the feasibility and acceptability of conducting such a trial by recruiting 14‐18‐year‐olds with a first episode of psychosis into a feasibility prospective randomised open blinded evaluation (PROBE) design, three‐arm, randomised controlled trial of APs alone versus PI alone versus a combination of both treatments. We aimed to recruit 90 participants from Early Intervention and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams in seven UK sites. APs were prescribed by participants' usual psychiatrists. PI comprised standardised cognitive behavioural therapy and family intervention sessions. Discussion: This is the first study to compare APs to PI in an adolescent population with FEP. Recruitment finished on 31 October 2018. The study faced difficulties with recruitment across most sites due to factors including clinician and service‐user treatment preferences. Trial registration: Current controlled trial with ISRCTN, ISRCTN80567433. Registered on 27 February 2017.

AB  - Integrated multi‐element psychosocial interventions have been suggested to improve the outcomes of first‐episode psychosis (FEP) patients, but they have been studied primarily in experimental settings and in nonepidemiologically representative samples. Thus, we performed a cluster‐randomized controlled trial, comparing an integrated multi‐element psychosocial intervention, comprising cognitive behavioral therapy, family intervention, and case management, with treatment as usual (TAU) for FEP patients in 117 community mental health centers (CMHCs) in a large area of northern Italy (10 million inhabitants). The randomized units (clusters) were the CMHCs, and the units of observation the patients (and, when available, their family members). The primary hypotheses were that add‐on multicomponent intervention: (1) results in greater improvements in symptoms, as assessed with positive and negative syndrome scale and (2) reduces in‐hospital stay, based on days of hospitalization over the 9‐month follow‐up. Four hundred and forty‐four FEP patients received the intervention or TAU and were assessed at baseline and 9 months. Based on the retention rates of patients (and families) in the experimental arm, multi‐element psychosocial interventions can be implemented in routine mental health services. Regarding primary outcomes, patients in the experimental arm showed greater reductions in overall symptom severity, while no difference could be found for days of hospitalization. Among the secondary outcomes, greater improvements were detected in the experimental arm for global functioning, emotional well‐being, and subjective burden of delusions. No difference could be found for service disengagement and subjective burden of auditory hallucinations. These findings support feasibility and effectiveness of early interventions for psychosis in generalist mental health services.

AB  - Background: Integrated multi‐element psychosocial interventions for first‐episode psychosis (FEP) patients may benefit from studies performed in real world setting and in epidemiologically representative samples to facilitate translation of findings to clinical practice and decision making. Methods: We performed a cluster‐randomized controlled trial, comparing an integrated multi‐element psychosocial intervention, comprising cognitive behavioural therapy, family intervention, and case management, with treatment as usual (TAU) for 1 year incident FEP patients in 117 community mental health centres (CMHCs) in a large area of northern Italy (10 million inhabitants), treated for 9 months after the first contact with services The randomized units (clusters) were the CMHCs, and the units of observation the patients (and, when available, their family members). Feasibility and effectiveness was tested, together with predictors and moderators of outcome. A subset of demographic and baseline clinical variables were selected a priori, on clinical grounds or derived from the literature, as potential predictors or moderators of outcomes at 9 months. These included gender, age at first‐contact, citizenship (Italian/non‐Italian), educational level, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), type of psychosis (affective/non‐affective), pre‐morbid functioning and insight into illness. Statistical analyses were conducted using an intention‐to‐treat (ITT) approach. Outcomes were analyzed separately in mixed‐effects random regression models. Results: A total of 444 patients completed the 9 month assessments. The integrated multi‐element psychosocial intervention proved to be superior to TAU in terms of reduction of overall symptom severity, greater improvements of global functioning, emotional well‐being, and subjective burden of delusions. Higher education, shorter DUP, better premorbid adjustment and insight into illness predicted better outcomes regardless of treatment. Age at first contact with the CMHC proved to be the only moderator of treatment outcome: TAU intervention proved to be ineffective in subjects aged 35 years and above, while the experimental treatment was more beneficial in all ages, and thus proved to be more generalisable Conclusions: This study, performed in the largest catchment area ever tested in FEP treatment, supports feasibility and effectiveness of early interventions for psychosis also when provided by dedicated Teams based in generalist mental health services and gives information on which patients benefit more from the experimental intervention. The identification of age at first contact as the only moderator of treatment outcome suggests that the GET UP multi‐element psychosocial intervention is beneficial to a broad array of FEP patients treated within routine community mental health services.

AB  - Abstract  Background  Altered functional connectivity (FC) is a common finding in resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) studies of people with psychosis, yet how FC disturbances evolve in the early stages of illness, and how antipsychotics may influence the temporal evolution of these disturbances, remains unclear. Here, we scanned first episode psychosis (FEP) patients who were and were not exposed to antipsychotic medication during the first six months of illness at baseline, three months, and 12 months, to characterize how FC changes over time and in relation to medication use.  Methods  Sixty-two antipsychotic-naive patients with FEP received either an atypical antipsychotic or a placebo pill over a treatment period of 6 months. Both FEP groups received intensive psychosocial therapy. A healthy control group (n=27) was also recruited. A total of 202 rs-fMRI scans were obtained across three timepoints: baseline, 3-months and 12-months. Our primary aim was to differentiate patterns of FC in antipsychotic-treated and antipsychotic-naive patients within the first 3 months of treatment, and to examine associations with clinical and functional outcomes. A secondary aim was to investigate long-term effects at the 12-month timepoint.  Results  At baseline, FEP patients showed widespread functional dysconnectivity in comparison to controls, with reductions predominantly affecting interactions between the default mode network (DMN), limbic systems, and the rest of the brain. From baseline to 3 months, patients receiving placebo showed increased FC principally within the same systems, and some of these changes correlated with improved clinical outcomes. Antipsychotic exposure was associated with increased FC primarily between the thalamus and the rest of the brain. At the 12-month follow-up, antipsychotic treatment was associated with a prolonged increase of FC primarily in the DMN and limbic systems.  Conclusions and Relevance  Antipsychotic-naive FEP patients show widespread functional dysconnectivity at baseline, followed by an early normalization of DMN and paralimbic dysfunction in patients receiving a psychosocial intervention only. Antipsychotic exposure is associated with distinct FC changes, principally concentrated on thalamo-cortical and limbic networks.

AB  - The aim of this dual-isotope SPECT imaging study was to evaluate striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and D2 receptor availability in first-episode never-treated and haloperidol-treated schizophrenic patients and whether the availability is associated with psychopathology. Twenty-four inpatients with a first acute schizophrenic episode were enrolled in the study; 12 of these patients were treated with haloperidol for 2 weeks before dual-isotope SPECT was performed, whereas the other 12 patients underwent the SPECT evaluation directly after enrollment. Twelve healthy control persons were also recruited and evaluated with the dual-isotope SPECT protocol. Psychopathology was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and other scales. D2-radioligand binding did not differ between drug-naive patients and the control group but was significantly lower in the haloperidol- treated group. DAT availability was also significantly lower in the haloperidol patients than in the other two groups and differed significantly between drug-naive, positive-syndrome- type patients and healthy controls. The data obtained with the new dual-isotope SPECT technique reveal a direct effect of haloperidol at the D2 and DAT receptor level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Early intervention services (EIS) for first episode psychosis (FEP) are now implemented worldwide and these integrated and team‐based treatment programs improve FEP outcomes while patients are participating. EIS models provide care for limited periods followed by return to standard services. Cross sectional follow‐up studies conducted after EIS participation ends have not found advantages compared with standard care. The RAISE‐ETP study was the first US‐based, multi‐center randomized clinical trial to compare an EIS, called NAVIGATE, to usual clinical care. Those who received NAVIGATE experienced significant improvement in symptoms and functioning compared to those who received usual care during the initial two‐year treatment period. We now report clinical outcomes covering five years, a time frame that includes care after EIS participation ended. Methods: RAISE‐ETP was a cluster randomized clinical trial conducted at 34 US sites; 17 sites provided NAVIGATE to 223 participants and 17 sites provided usual clinical care to 181 participants. NAVIGATE was available until the last randomized subject had the opportunity for two years of services. Participants were assessed every six months by masked, centralized assessors utilizing live two‐way video and using the Heinrichs‐Carpenter Quality of Life Scale (QLS) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results: Participants had a mean age of 23 years and the majority were male; (78% in NAVIGATE and 66% in usual care). The mean opportunity for NAVIGATE treatment was 33.8 (SD = 5.1) months; the longest 44.4 months. Analysis of missing data patterns suggested using a not missing at random (NMAR) approach instead of the more commonly used missing at random (MAR) statistical approach. A NMAR shared parameter analysis of QLS total scores revealed a significant overall treatment by time interaction (p < 0.001) with a 13.14 unit difference favoring NAVIGATE over the full five‐year study. A similar analysis of the PANSS total score also revealed a significant overall treatment by time interaction (p < 0.002) with a 7.73 unit difference favoring NAVIGATE over the 5‐year study. Conclusions: The RAISE‐ETP study provides compelling evidence of a substantial benefit in quality of life and in symptom outcomes of the NAVIGATE EIS compared with usual care for FEP over 5 years, a period with EIS and non‐EIS treatment. Our ability to detect these advantages in contrast to earlier EIS follow‐up studies may be due to our longitudinal assessment model that provided periodic assessment over the full five‐year study as well as differences in the statistical approaches of the studies.

AB  - The objectives of this review are to describe different specialized first-episode psychosis services (FEP) and report their results at different times of follow-up in order to determine what specific approaches they should include, the optimal duration of treatment, and the characteristics of the patients who benefit the most from such programs. We systematically reviewed psycINFO and MEDLINE in search of studies dealing with efficacy or efficiency of specialized FEP programs. We only included research that had at least one comparison group and excluded those dealing with primary prevention of psychosis or prodromal interventions. Result demonstrates that five, all Scandinavian, programs and their results at different follow-up times are presented. The Parachute project started in 1994 in Sweden with the objectives to use low dosages of antipsychotics (AP), to minimize hospitalizations, to offer specialized individual and familial psychotherapy, and to assure continuity of care during a five-year period. The programs specialized in the treatment of FEP show encouraging results mainly during their active phase.. This review suggests that a two-year treatment period is not long enough to enable patients to maintain the improvements obtained during the active phase of an integrated treatment. Future studies should aim to determine -the characteristics of the patients that most benefit from-the specific interventions that should be included in and- the ideal duration of treatment of the comprehensive FEP programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients in early phases of psychosis often struggle with depressive symptoms and low self-esteem. The main aims of the present study were to examine whether cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) compared to treatment as usual (TAU) would reduce depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and increase self-esteem (secondary outcome). Furthermore, we wanted to examine whether CBT reduces symptoms measured with the PANSS (positive, negative, cognitive, or excited symptoms) or increases general functioning compared to TAU. METHODS: A total of 63 early psychosis patients were included and randomly assigned to receive either CBT (maximum 26 sessions) or TAU for a period of up to six months. A linear mixed model was used for longitudinal analysis, with a focus on whether patients in the CBT group or the TAU group changed differently to one another between the baseline and 15-month follow-up. RESULTS: There were no differences between the CBT group and TAU group regarding improvements in depressive symptoms measured with the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (P=0.188) or self-esteem measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (P=0.580). However, patients in the CBT group improved significantly more on negative symptoms (P=0.002) and social functioning (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find CBT to be more effective than TAU in reducing depressive symptoms or increasing self-esteem in patients with early psychosis. However, CBT seems to improve negative symptoms and functioning. These results still need to be replicated in further studies as the present one was merely an exploratory analysis.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive first‐episode service, the clinic for Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP), in an urban U.S. community mental health center by comparing it with usual treatment. Methods: This pragmatic randomized controlled trial enrolled 120 patients with first‐episode psychosis within five years of illness onset and 12 weeks of antipsychotic exposure. Referrals were mostly from inpatient psychiatric units, and enrollees were randomly allocated to STEP or usual treatment. Main outcomes included hospital utilization (primary); the ability to work or attend age‐appropriate schooling ‐ or to actively seek these opportunities (vocational engagement); and general functioning. Analysis was by modified intent to treat (excluding only three who withdrew consent) for hospitalization; for other outcomes, only data for completers were analyzed. Results: After one year, STEP participants had less inpatient utilization compared with those in usual treatment: no psychiatric hospitalizations, 77% versus 56% (risk ratio [RR]=1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.08‐1.58); mean hospitalizations, .33+/‐.70 versus .68+/‐.92 (p=.02); and mean bed‐days, 5.34+/‐13.53 versus 11.51+/‐15.04 (p=.05). For every five patients allocated to STEP versus usual treatment, one additional patient avoided hospitalization over the first year (number needed to treat=5; CI=2.7‐26.5). STEP participants also demonstrated better vocational engagement (91.7% versus 66.7%; RR=1.40, CI=1.18‐1.48) and showed salutary trends in global functioning measures. Conclusions: This trial demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of a U.S. public‐sector model of early intervention for psychotic illnesses. Such services can also support translational research and are a relevant model for other serious mental illnesses.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the current post hoc analysis was to evaluate the proportion of adolescent patients with schizophrenia who achieved sustained remission and recovery during 2 years of treatment with lurasidone. Methods: Patients aged 13â€“17 years with a DSM‐IV‐Text Revised diagnosis of schizophrenia and a Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) total score â‰¥70 and <120 were randomized to 6 weeks of double‐blind (DB), fixed‐dose treatment with lurasidone (40 or 80 mg per day) or placebo. Patients who completed 6 weeks of DB treatment were eligible to enroll in a 2‐year, open‐label (OL), flexible‐dose extension study of lurasidone (40â€“80 mg per day). Efficacy measures included the PANSS total score. The criterion for response was â‰¥20‐percent reduction from DB baseline in PANSS total score. The criteria for remission and sustained remission were the consensus criteria. The criteria for recovery consisted of meeting the remission criteria plus having a Childrenâ€™s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) score â‰¥70, indicating no clinically significant functional impairment at that visit. Results: A total of 271 patients completed the 6‐week DB study and entered the OL extension study, and 186 (68.6%) and 156 (57.6%) completed 52 weeks and 104 weeks of treatment, respectively. For patients who entered the extension phase, the mean change from DB to OL baseline in PANSS total score was â€“17.5, and the mean change from DB baseline in the PANSS total score in the OL phase at weeks 52 and 104 was â€“32.4 and â€“34.3, respectively. Responder and remission rates at OL baseline, week 52, and week 104 were 63.1 percent and 38.0 percent, 92.1 percent and 65.6 percent, and 91.0 percent and 66.0 percent, respectively. During OL lurasidone, 52.8 percent met the sustained remission criteria; the Kaplan‐Meier estimate of median time to first onset of sustained remission was 64.1 weeks (95% CI = 40.4, 76.1 weeks). Recovery rates at OL baseline, week 52, and week 104 were 12.2 percent, 43.9 percent, and 51.3 percent, respectively. Conclusions: For adolescents with schizophrenia, long‐term treatment with lurasidone was associated with continued improvement in psychotic symptoms, resulting in progressively higher rates of remission and recovery over a 2‐year period.

AB  - Background: In 60%‐90% of cases, psychosis disrupts vocational or academic engagement [1]. JobPrescription aims for employment/studies through Individual Placement and Support (IPS). Sixty‐one participants (2010‐2013) with psychotic disorders entered the project, about half on the initiative of treating clinician. 41% attained regular paid employment, 20% were in internships. The mean time from project inclusion to employment was 3.6 months (SD 0.7). However, these figures have not been compared to a control group, and the group was a mix of chronic and first‐episode patients. Objective: To evaluate the effect of this intervention using a randomised controlled trial. Methods: First‐episode psychosis (FEP) patients aged 15‐65 are referred by TIPS early detection and randomised to treatment as usual or Job‐ Prescription. Single blind assessments are carried out at baseline, 3 and 24 months. Primary outcome measures are employment/study status. Secondary outcomes are quality of life and psychological well‐being. Symptom levels and neuropsychological function are analysed as covariates. Results: By April 2014, 20 patients were included. Four of 8 in the control and 9 of 12 in the experimental arm are engaged in employment or studies. Preliminary results on symptoms, quality of life, and (neuro)psychological factors will be presented. Study inclusion continues until 60 participants. Discussion: Experiences from JobPrescription seem to indicate favourable results. However, threats to the RCT include a 50% refusal rate, possibly due to the risk of randomisation to the wait‐list condition; and treatment as usual increasingly making use of IPS methods and thus contaminating the control arm.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta‐analyses have reported that the effects of cognitive remediation might go beyond improvement in cognition to include unexpected benefits for schizophrenia patients such as negative symptom reduction and improvements in functioning. In addition, some evidence indicated that these potentially beneficial effects are also present in the initial course of schizophrenia, but work in this area is still developing. METHOD: A RCT compared Cognitive Remediation (CR) to Healthy Behaviors Training (HBT) in 80 patients (78% male) with a mean age of 21.9years and mean education of 12.3years who had a first psychotic episode within two years of study entry. Participants were trained using CR programs or received HBT involving 50 sessions over 6months and then booster sessions over the next 6months. The SANS and BPRS were used to assess symptoms. The UCLA Social Attainment Survey assessed social functioning. RESULTS: Using GLMM, improvements over 12months were found favoring CR for SANS Expressive Symptoms (p<0.01), which was composed of Affective Flattening (p<0.01) and Alogia (p=0.04), and for SANS Experiential Symptoms, composed of Avolition/Apathy (p=0.04) and Anhedonia/Asociality (p<0.01). CR was associated with improvements in social functioning (p=0.05) as compared to HBT. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that the beneficial effects of CR appear to extend beyond cognition to improvements in negative symptoms and social functioning in early course schizophrenia patients. These results suggest that cognitive remediation might have an impact when the reduction of risk factors for chronicity is most critical for promoting recovery.

AB  - Poor insight impedes treatment in early phase psychosis (EPP). This manuscript outlines preliminary findings of an investigation of the novel metacognitively oriented integrative psychotherapy, Metacognitive Reflection and Insight Therapy, for individuals with early phase psychosis (MERIT-EP). Twenty adults with EPP and poor insight were randomized to either six months of MERIT-EP or treatment as usual (TAU). Therapists were trained and therapy was successfully delivered under routine, outpatient conditions. Insight, assessed before and after treatment, revealed significant improvement for the MERIT-EP, but not TAU, group. These results suggest MERIT-EP is feasible to deliver, accepted by patients, and leads to clinically significant improvements in insight. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Studied the long-term effects of a cognitive behavior intervention on 1st episode schizophrenia. 251 patients with 1st episode schizophrenia were randomly divided into an intervention group (n=126), receiving cognitive behavior intervention and regular antipsychotics and a control group (n=125), receiving regular antipsychotics only. There were no significant difference between the 2 groups in antipsychotics use. Both groups were given the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) 2 yrs after the initial study, and the results were compared. The results show that the rate of relapse in the intervention group was lower than the rate in control group; the total score and factor scores of the PANSS were lower in the intervention group. The patients in the intervention group had better insight into their illness and better compliance with treatment. The study concludes that cognitive behavior intervention benefits the patients with first episode schizophrenia. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The majority of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients reach clinical remission; however, rates of relapse are high. This study sought to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to prevent relapse in FEP patients. Methods: Systematic review and metaanalysis of RCTs. Results: Of 66 studies retrieved, 18 were eligible for inclusion. Nine studies investigated psychosocial interventions and 9 pharmacological treatments. The analysis of 3 RCTs of psychosocial interventions comparing specialist FEP programs vs treatment as usual involving 679 patients demonstrated the former to be more effective in preventing relapse (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.31-2.48; P < .001; number needed to treat [NNT] = 10). While the analysis of 3 different cognitive-behavioral studies not specifically intended at preventing relapse showed no further benefits compared with specialist FEP programs (OR = 1.95, 95% CI = 0.76-5.00; P = .17), the combination of specific individual and family intervention targeted at relapse prevention may further improve upon these outcomes (OR54.88, 95% CI = 0.97-24.60; P = .06). Only 3 small studies compared first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) with placebo with no significant differences regarding relapse prevention although all individual estimates favored FGAs (OR = 2.82, 95% CI = 0.54-14.75; P = .22). Exploratory analysis involving 1055 FEP patients revealed that relapse rates were significantly lower with second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) compared with FGAs (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.07-2.01; P < .02; NNT = 10). Conclusions: Specialist FEP programs are effective in preventing relapse. Cognitive-based individual and family interventions may need to specifically target relapse to obtain relapse prevention benefits that extend beyond those provided by specialist FEP programs. Overall, the available data suggest that FGAs and SGAs have the potential to reduce relapse rates. Future trials should examine the effectiveness of placebo vs antipsychotics in combination with intensive psychosocial interventions in preventing relapse in the early course of psychosis. Further studies should identify those patients who may not need antipsychotic medication to be able to recover from psychosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for psychosis is a distinct type of psychotherapy that has been recommended together with antipsychotic drugs and comprehensive usual care in the management of schizophrenia, a complex mental health disorder associated with a high economic and societal burden. The objectives of this report were to assess the effectiveness, harms, cost-effectiveness, and lived experience of CBT for psychosis in improving outcomes for adults with a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia. Methods We performed literature searches on March 28 and April 5, 2017, and undertook a qualitative synthesis of systematic reviews of the clinical and economic literature comparing CBT for psychosis with any comparator interventions (e.g., usual care, waitlist control, or pharmacotherapy) in adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia as defined by any criteria (including related disorders such as schizoaffective disorder). We developed an individual-level state-transition probabilistic model for a hypothetical cohort of adults aged 18 years and older starting with first-episode psychosis. We compared three strategies: usual care, CBT for psychosis by physicians, and CBT for psychosis by regulated nonphysician therapists. The CBT was provided in person together with usual care including pharmacotherapy: 16 structured sessions (individual or group) for first-episode psychosis and 24 individual sessions for relapse or treatment-resistant disease. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over 5 years using the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care perspective and a discount rate of 1.5%. We also estimated the 5-year budget impact of publicly funding CBT for psychosis in Ontario. In addition, we interviewed 13 people with lived experience of schizophrenia and psychosis about their values and preferences surrounding CBT and other treatments. Results CBT for psychosis compared with usual care significantly improved overall psychotic symptoms (standard mean difference [SMD] -0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.45 to -0.21), positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations) (SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.58 to -0.10), auditory symptoms (SMD 0.39, 95% CI not reported, P <.005), delusions (SMD 0.33, 95% CI not reported, P <.05) and negative symptoms (e.g., blunt affect) (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.04) at end of treatment. No significant differences were observed for social function, distress associated with psychosis, relapse, or quality of life. Compared with any control, CBT for psychosis significantly improved overall psychotic symptoms, positive symptoms, auditory hallucinations, delusions, and negative symptoms. Compared with other forms of therapy, CBT for psychosis showed inconsistent results at end of treatment for overall psychotic symptoms, positive symptoms, auditory hallucinations, and delusions. In people with first-episode psychosis, CBT for psychosis was not significantly more effective for the prevention of relapse when compared with other forms of therapy or usual care (odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.63-1.95 and OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.65-2.04, respectively). Low-intensity CBT for psychosis (fewer than 16 face-to-face sessions) compared with any type of treatment significantly improved overall psychotic symptoms and social function at follow-up (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.74 to -0.06 and SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.81 to -0.33, respectively). In the cost-utility analysis, CBT for psychosis provided by nonphysician therapists compared with usual care was associated with increases in both quality-adjusted life-years (mean 0.1159 QALYs, 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.09-0.14) and costs (mean $2,494, 95% Crl $1,472- $3,544), yielding an ICER of $21,520 per QALY gained. CBT for psychosis provided by physicians was dominated because it was equally effective but more expensive (mean $2,976, 95% CrI $2,822-$3,129; ICER of CBT for psychosis vs. usual care: $47,196/QALY gained). Assuming a 20% increase in access per year (from 0% at baseline to 100% in year 5), we estimated the total 5-year net budget impact of publicl funding CBT for psychosis would be about $15.2 million for nonphysician providers and about $35.4 million if provided by psychiatrists. It is estimated that by the year 2021, approximately 110 nonphysician therapists or 150 physicians would be needed to provide CBT for psychosis to more than 12,000 adults with schizophrenia (including about 8,500 incident cases) in Ontario. People with schizophrenia and their family members reported positive experiences with CBT for psychosis. They felt it provided effective tools to help manage their schizophrenia but stressed that it was only effective in conjunction with medication to control psychotic episodes and overcome a patient's denial of illness. Geographic and financial barriers have restricted access to this psychotherapy. Conclusions Compared with usual care or any control, CBT for psychosis significantly improved psychotic symptoms, based on evidence of moderate to adequate quality; no significant improvements were observed for social function, relapse, or quality of life outcomes. People affected by schizophrenia reported that CBT for psychosis was valuable in conjunction with antipsychotic medication but that access to this type of psychotherapy is limited. Adding CBT for psychosis to usual care in the management of adult schizophrenia probably represents good value for money in Ontario. Depending on the type of provider, therapy format, and rate of access, the net budget impact to Ontario's publicly funded health system would likely be between $15 million to $35 million over the next 5 years.

AB  - Background Early intervention services for psychosis aim to detect emergent symptoms, reduce the duration of untreated psychosis, and improve access to effective treatments. Aims To evaluate the effectiveness of early intervention services, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and family intervention in early psychosis. Method Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of early intervention services, CBT and family intervention for people with early psychosis. Results Early intervention services reduced hospital admission, relapse rates and symptom severity, and improved access to and engagement with treatment. Used alone, family intervention reduced relapse and hospital admission rates, whereas CBT reduced the severity of symptoms with little impact on relapse or hospital admission. Conclusions For people with early psychosis, early intervention services appear to have clinically important benefits over standard care. Including CBT and family intervention within the service may contribute to improved outcomes in this critical period. The longer-term benefits of this approach and its component treatments for people with early and established psychosis need further research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Relapse risk during the early years of first-episode psychosis (FEP) considerably increases the risk of chronicity. The effectiveness of family intervention for psychosis (FIp) for preventing relapse after FEP remains unknown. We assessed the effectiveness of FIp until 24 months of follow-up for preventing relapse and other relapse-related outcomes in patients following FEP. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane, PubMed, PsycINFO, and ProQuest databases in June 2018. A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), sensitivity analyses, and publication bias were performed, comparing to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus other psychosocial interventions. Outcomes assessed were relapse rates, duration of hospitalization, psychotic symptoms, and functionality. Risk ratios (RRs) and (standardized) mean differences (SMD; MD) were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 2109 records retrieved, 14 (11 RCTs) were included. Pooled results showed that FIp was effective for preventing relapse (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.61) compared to TAU and/or other psychosocial interventions. It also proved effective when compared to TAU alone (RR = 0.36) and TAU plus other psychosocial interventions (RR = 0.48). FIp showed benefits in reducing duration of hospitalization (TAU, MD = -3.31; other interventions, MD = -4.57) and psychotic symptoms (TAU, SMD = -0.68), and increased functionality (TAU, SMD = 1.36; other interventions, SMD = 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that FIp is effective for reducing relapse rates, duration of hospitalization, and psychotic symptoms, and for increasing functionality in FEP patients up to 24 months. The study's main limitations were the inclusion of published research only; authors were not contacted for missing/additional data; and high heterogeneity regarding relapse definition was observed.

AB  - Background: The value of early intervention in psychosis and allocation of public resources has long been debated since outcomes in people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders have remained suboptimal. Several research programs for early psychosis yielded promising results for teambased, multi-element coordinated specialty care (CSC). Method(s): Systematic literature search of PubMed/PsycInfo/Embase/clinicaltrials. gov without language restrictions until 06/06/2017. Random effects meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing CSC versus Treatment as Usual (TAU) in in first episode psychosis or early-phase schizophreniaspectrum disorders (schizophrenia, psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder), calculating standardized mean differences (SMDs) and risk ratios (RRs) for continuous and categorical outcomes as well as prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Co-primary outcomes were all-cause treatment discontinuation and >=1 psychiatric hospitalization during the treatment period. Key secondary outcomes were total symptom improvement, functioning, and work or school involvement. Result(s): Across 10 trials (n=2,176; age=27.5 +/- 4.6 years; male=62.3%; trial duration=16.2 +/- 7.4 (range=9-24) months), CSC outperformed TAU at the end of treatment regarding all meta-analyzable outcomes. This included all-cause discontinuation (studies=10, n=2,173, RR=0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.61-0.80, p<0.001; number-needed-to-treat (NNT)=12.4), >=1 hospitalization (studies=10, n=2,105, RR=0.74, 95%CI=0.61-0.90, p=0.003; NNT=10.1), total symptom severity (studies=8, n=1,179, SMD=- 0.32, 95%CI=-0.47, -0.17, p<0.001), positive symptoms (studies=10, n=1,532, SMD=-0.22, 95%CI=-0.32, -0.13, p<0.001), negative symptoms (studies=10, n=1,432, SMD=-0.28, 95%CI=-0.42, -0.14, p<0.001), general symptoms (studies=8, n=1,118, SMD=-0.30, 95%CI=-0.47, -0.13, p=0.001), depressive symptoms (studies=5, n=874, SMD=-0.19, 95%CI=- 0.35, -0.03, p=0.017), functioning (studies=7, n=1,005, SMD=0.21, 95%CI=0.09-0.34, p=0.001), involvement in school/work (studies=6, n=1,743, RR=1.13, 95%CI=1.03-1.24, p=0.012; NNT=17.8), and quality of life (studies=4, n=505, SMD=0.23, 95%CI=0.004-0.456, p=0.046). Superiority of CSC regarding all outcomes was also evident at 6, 9-12, and 18-24 months of treatment (except general symptoms and depression at 18-24 months). Discussion(s): In early psychosis, CSC is superior to TAU across all meta-analyzable, highly relevant outcomes with small-to-medium effect sizes. These results support the need for funding and utilization of CSC in patients with early-phase psychosis.

AB  - Schizophrenia is the eighth leading cause of disability worldwide in people aged 15-44 years. Before antidopaminergic antipsychotics were introduced in the 1950s, no effective medications existed for the treatment of schizophrenia. This review summarizes key meta-analytic findings regarding antipsychotic efficacy in the acute treatment of schizophrenia, including clozapine in treatment-resistant patients. In the most comprehensive meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials conducted in multi-episode schizophrenia, antipsychotics outperformed placebo regarding total symptoms, positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, quality of life and social functioning. Amongst these outcomes, the standardized mean difference for overall symptoms was largest, that is, 0.47 (95% credible interval = 0.42-0.51), approaching a medium effect size, being reduced to 0.38 when publication bias and small-trial effects were accounted for. A comparison of two meta-analyses indicated that first-episode patients, compared with multi-episode patients, were more likely to have at least minimal treatment response [⩾20% Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)/Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score reduction: 81% versus 51%] and good response (⩾50% PANSS/BPRS score reduction: 52% versus 23%). In multi-episode schizophrenia, no response or worsening after 2 weeks of a therapeutic antipsychotic dose was highly predictive of not achieving a good response at endpoint (median treatment = 6 weeks: specificity = 86%; positive predictive value = 90%), suggesting a change in treatment should be considered in such cases. In first-episode psychosis, adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment trials for more than 2 weeks are recommended before using no response or worsening as a decision point for aborting a given antipsychotic. In clearly defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine generally outperformed other antipsychotics, especially when dosed appropriately (target = 3-6 months' duration; trough clozapine level ⩾350-400 μg/L) with a response rate (⩾20% PANSS/BPRS) of 33% by 3 months of treatment. High antipsychotic doses and psychotropic combinations are unlikely to be superior to standard doses of antipsychotic monotherapy. Acute antipsychotic efficacy in schizophrenia depends on the targeted symptom domain (greater efficacy: total and positive symptoms, lesser efficacy: negative symptoms, depressive symptoms, social functioning and quality of life). Greater antipsychotic efficacy is associated with higher total baseline symptom severity, treatment-naïveté/first-episode status, shorter illness duration, and trials that are nonindustry sponsored and that have a lower placebo effect. The heterogeneity of antipsychotic response across individuals and key symptom domains, the considerable degree of nonresponse/treatment resistance in multi-episode patients, and the adverse effect potential of antipsychotics are major limitations, underscoring the need to develop new medications for the treatment of schizophrenia. Drug development should include matching patient subgroups, which are identified by means of clinical and biomarker variables, to mechanisms of action of novel medications, targeting specific symptom domains, and investigating mechanisms of action other than dopaminergic blockade.

AB  - Background: Antipsychotic drugs remain the mainstay of the pharmacological treatment in schizophrenia. The effectiveness of the drug group is under debate. Objective(s): The primary aim of the presentation is to give an update on the current evidence base regarding antipsychotic treatment effectiveness of schizophrenia. A secondary aim is to assess treatment effectiveness in different sub-populations. Method(s): The PubMED, Cochrane library, and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of antipsychotic drug treatment compared to placebo and head-to-head comparisons of different antipsychotics. Another search for single studies not included in the systematic reviews was also conducted. Result(s): Antipsychotic drugs have moderate to large effect sizes compared to placebo for overall antipsychotic effectiveness. Differences among some of the agents exist but effect sizes are generally small. A subgroup of patients seems to be non-responders from the start and represents a particular challenge. Response rates are substantially larger in first-episode studies compared to in studies in chronic phase samples. Antipsychotic drugs show large effect sizes for relapse prevention compared to placebo. Conclusion(s): Antipsychotic drug treatment has moderate to large effect size, but is not equally effective in all sub-groups of patients.

AB  - <b>Background</b>Negative symptoms observed in patients with psychotic disorders undermine quality of life and functioning. Antipsychotic medications have a limited impact. Psychological and psychosocial interventions, with medication, are recommended. However, evidence for the effectiveness of specific non-biological interventions warrants detailed examination. <b>Aims</b>To conduct a meta-analytic and systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of non-biological treatments for negative symptoms in psychotic disorders. <b>Method</b>We searched for randomised controlled studies of psychological and psychosocial interventions in psychotic disorders that reported outcome on negative symptoms. Standardised mean differences (SMDs) in values of negative symptoms at the end of treatment were calculated across study domains as the main outcome measure. <b>Results</b>A total of 95 studies met our criteria and 72 had complete quantitative data. Compared with treatment as usual cognitive-behavioural therapy (pooled SMD -0.34, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.12), skills-based training (pooled SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.10), exercise (pooled SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.71 to -0.01), and music treatments (pooled SMD -0.58, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.33) provide significant benefit. Integrated treatment models are effective for early psychosis (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.22) as long as the patients remain in treatment. Overall quality of evidence was moderate with a high level of heterogeneity. <b>Conclusions</b>Specific psychological and psychosocial interventions have utility in ameliorating negative symptoms in psychosis and should be included in the treatment of negative symptoms. However, more effective treatments for negative symptoms need to be developed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Psychosis is an illness characterised by the presence of hallucinations and delusions that can cause distress or a marked change in an individual's behaviour (e.g. social withdrawal, flat or blunted effect). A first episode of psychosis (FEP) is the first time someone experiences these symptoms that can occur at any age, but the condition is most common in late adolescence and early adulthood. This review is concerned with FEP and the early stages of a psychosis, referred to throughout this review as 'recent-onset psychosis.' Specialised early intervention (SEI) teams are community mental health teams that specifically treat people who are experiencing, or have experienced, a recent-onset psychosis. SEI teams provide a range of treatments including medication, psychotherapy, psychoeducation, educational and employment support, augmented by assertive contact with the service user and small caseloads. Treatment is time limited, usually offered for two to three years, after which service users are either discharged to primary care or transferred to a standard adult community mental health team. Evidence suggests that once SEI treatment ends, improvements may not be sustained, bringing uncertainty about the optimal duration of SEI to ensure the best long-term outcomes. Extending SEI has been proposed as a way of providing continued intensive treatment and continuity of care, of usually up to five years, in order to a) sustain the positive initial outcomes of SEI; and b) improve the long-term trajectory of the illness. OBJECTIVES: To compare extended SEI teams with treatment as usual (TAU) for people with recent-onset psychosis. To compare extended SEI teams with standard SEI teams followed by TAU (standard SEI + TAU) for people with recent-onset psychosis. SEARCH METHODS: On 3 October 2018 and 22 October 2019, we searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study-based register of trials, including registries of clinical trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing extended SEI with TAU for people with recent-onset psychosis and all RCTs comparing extended SEI with standard SEI + TAU for people with recent-onset psychosis. We entered trials meeting these criteria and reporting usable data as included studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes we calculated the risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and their 95% CIs, or if assessment measures differed for the same construct, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included three RCTs, with a total 780 participants, aged 16 to 35 years. All participants met the criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective psychoses. No trials compared extended SEI with TAU. All three trials randomly allocated people approximately two years into standard SEI to either extended SEI or standard SEI + TAU. The certainty of evidence for outcomes varied from low to very low. Our primary outcomes were recovery and disengagement from mental health services. No trials reported on recovery, and we used remission as a proxy. Three trials reported on remission, with the point estimate suggesting a 13% increase in remission in favour of extended SEI, but this included wide confidence intervals (CIs) and a very uncertain estimate of no benefit (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.31; 3 trials, 780 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Two trials provided data on disengagement from services with evidence that extended SEI care may result in fewer disengagements from mental health treatment (15%) in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (34%) (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.75; 2 trials, 380 participants; low-certainty evidence). There may be no evidence of a difference in rates of psychiatric hospital admission (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.68 to 3.52; 1 trial, 160 participants; low-certainty evidence), or the number of days spent in a psychiatric hospital (MD -2.70, 95% CI -8.30 to 2.90; 1 trial, 400 participants; low-certainty evidence). One trial found uncertain evidence regarding lower global psychotic symptoms in extended SEI in comparison to standard SEI + TAU (MD -1.90, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.52; 1 trial, 156 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It was uncertain whether the use of extended SEI over standard SEI + TAU resulted in fewer deaths due to all-cause mortality, as so few deaths were recorded in trials (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.64; 3 trials, 780 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very uncertain evidence suggests that using extended SEI instead of standard SEI + TAU may not improve global functioning (SMD 0.23, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.76; 2 trials, 560 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was low risk of bias in all three trials for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and other biases. All three trials had high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel due to the nature of the intervention. For the risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessments and incomplete outcome data there was at least one trial with high or unclear risk of bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There may be preliminary evidence of benefit from extending SEI team care for treating people experiencing psychosis, with fewer people disengaging from mental health services. Evidence regarding other outcomes was uncertain. The certainty of evidence for the measured outcomes was low or very low. Further, suitably powered studies that use a consistent approach to outcome selection are needed, but with only one further ongoing trial, there is unlikely to be any definitive conclusion for the effectiveness of extended SEI for at least the next few years.

AB  - The regular use of antipsychotic medication is known to improve overall outcomes and diminish risk of relapse, but applying the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) into routine clinical practice is not always straightforward. Furthermore, psychiatrists, service users and policy makers can have trouble keeping up with the burgeoning and, at times, conflicting results from research trials, meta-analysis and systematic reviews. In this paper we examine the differences between efficacy and effectiveness trials with regard to antipsychotic medication with a focus on first-episode psychosis, after reviewing the relative contribution of antipsychotic medication to outcomes in schizophrenia.

AB  - This report evaluates whether a program for older volunteers, designed for both generativity and health promotion, leads to short-term improvements in multiple behavioral risk factors and positive effects on intermediary risk factors for disability and other morbidities. The Experience Corps places older volunteers in public elementary schools in roles designed to meet schools' needs and increase the social, physical, and cognitive activity of the volunteers. This article reports on a pilot randomized trial in Baltimore, Maryland. The 128 volunteers were 6086 years old; 95% were African American. At follow-up of 48 months, physical activity, strength, people one could turn to for help, and cognitive activity increased significantly, and walking speed decreased significantly less, in participants compared to controls. In this pilot trial, physical, cognitive, and social activity increased, suggesting the potential for the Experience Corps to improve health for an aging population and simultaneously improve educational outcomes for children.

AB  - In this paper, we document the pattern of unpaid domestic and care work, disaggregated on the basis of the type of work and the care recipient, and its partial correlation with subjective well-being as measured by reported life satisfaction. We explore gender-specific effects since domestic and unpaid work has an intrinsic relational dimension that, at least in the current Italian society, has an important gender-specific component. The data used come from the 2012 Survey on the Economic and Social Conditions in the Modena District (ICESmo3) which is a unique dataset that contains disaggregated data on unpaid work. In particular, this dataset allows us to look at the correlations between the different types of unpaid work and reported life satisfaction. The overall picture that emerges from the data is one where unpaid work within the household is more likely to be conducive of well-being if it is more likely to be genuinely voluntary and intrinsically motivated. Although we must admit that this conclusion is highly speculative, we think it is a good starting point for further analyses in this regard.

AB  - Compared life satisfaction, depression, and self-esteem of older women who considered themselves retired only, homemakers only, or both. 242 Black and 622 White women aged 60+ yrs completed questionnaires. Retired women and homemakers did not differ in well-being; women who called themselves both had higher self-esteem and lower depression than single-role women. In analyses exploring what daily activities might explain group differences in well-being, do-it-yourself activities and volunteer activities were significant. Age, education, health, and marital status were also important factors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: To understand the role of community participation in prevention of first lifetime depressive episode in older women and men. Methods: We used data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study to identify variables that predicted risk for the emergence of depressive symptoms and tested a hypothesis that community participation would protect women from depression more than it would protect men. The sample was drawn from Wisconsin high school graduates who were approximately 64–66 years of age in the 2003–2005 data collection period ( n = 2546 with complete data meeting inclusion criteria.) The sample consisted of persons who had no evidence of current or prior lifetime depression in the 1993 data collection period. The emergence of high depressive symptoms was examined for women and men as a function of community participation and other covariates, including social support. Results: The emergence of depressive symptoms for both sexes was predicted by poorer reported health status and higher levels of subthreshold depressive symptoms during the previous interview. For men, additional risk factors were pain and low income. For women, additional risks were widowhood, lower education, and lower community participation. Conclusions: Community participation, in the form of volunteering, religious attendance, and engagement in community organizations, is related to reduced risk of first-time depressive symptoms among older women.

AB  - The role context approach suggests that certain role combinations are riskier for physical health while others are protective, and this dissertation provided an innovative approach to investigating this premise by using theory and previous research to guide the creation of a role typology, consisting of distinct combinations of roles, that were then linked to physical health profiles. It further considered how role quantity and changes in role types over time, designated as role trajectories, impacted health. Three studies were conducted using longitudinal data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, a national sample of women and men ages 35 to 84 who participated in two waves of data collection (N=1805), as well as a subset who provided extensive biological information (N=887). Study 1 showed that role combinations and role quantity were associated with current physical health, and some evidence suggested the specific role combination occupied also influenced health change across time. Having protective primary roles along with a volunteer and/or religious participant role was linked with better current health and the maintenance of better health across time, relative to other role types, thereby supporting the role context approach. Considering changes in role combinations over time, Study 2 revealed that role trajectories were associated with current health and change in health across time, thus providing some support that an individual's role trajectory was leading to health changes, and that some effects were not due entirely to individuals modifying their role commitments in response to health changes. There was compelling evidence that individuals in protective role types across time had the best health profiles relative to other role trajectories, while individuals on a persistent risk trajectory tended to have the worst health. Regarding links between role involvement and biomarkers, Study 3 found little support that having a higher quantity of roles was beneficial for biological health or that individuals on a persistent protection trajectory had more optimal biological regulation. Overall, role types and role trajectories had noteworthy links to physical health, suggesting this innovative approach to investigating role combinations is useful for future studies of role involvement.

AB  - Purpose: Regular physical activity is a key component of healthy aging, but few older adults meet physical activity guidelines. Poor aging expectations can contribute to this lack of activity, since negative stereotypes about the aging process can be internalized and affect physical performance. Although prior cross-sectional studies have shown that physical activity and aging expectations are associated, less is known about this association longitudinally, particularly among traditionally underrepresented groups. It is also unclear whether different domains of aging expectations are differentially associated with physical activity. Design and Methods: The number of minutes/week of physical activity in which Baltimore Experience Corps Trial participants (N = 446; 92.6% African American) engaged were measured using the CHAMPS questionnaire, while their aging expectations were measured using the ERA-12 survey. Linear mixed effects models assessed the association between physical activity and aging expectations over 2 years, both in full and sex-stratified samples. Separate models were also fit for different ERA-12 domains. Results: We found that higher overall expectations regarding aging are associated with higher engagement in moderate- to high-intensity physical activity over a 2-year period of time for women only. When the ERA-12 domains were examined separately, only the physical domain was associated with physical activity, both in women and overall. Implications: Low expectations regarding physical aging may represent a barrier to physical activity for older adults. Given that most older adults do not meet recommended physical activity guidelines, identifying factors that improve aging expectations may be a way to increase physical activity levels in aging populations.

AB  - Over the past decades, the number of years an average worker may expect to live after retirement has increased (Social Security Advisory Board, 1999), and retirees can expect to live longer in better health conditions (Bass, 2000). Despite these changes, few studies have examined an extensive range of retirees' activities. Having more knowledge about activity participation in retirement is an important starting point for considering specific programs or the service needs of retired older adults. This study explored activity participation in retirement using Atchley's continuity theory (1989) and Lawton's model of activity participation (1983b; 1985) as underlying conceptual frameworks. Three main areas of inquiry examined in this study included: (1) the prevalence and pattern of activity participation in pre- and post-retirement; (2) continuity and change of activity participation into retirement; and (3) factors influencing post-retirement activity participation. Using data from four waves (1986, 1989, 1994 and 2001/2002) of the Americans' Changing Lives study—a national longitudinal panel survey collected through face-to-face interviews—activities were categorized into the following eight types: formal volunteer work, informal volunteer work (assistance), caregiving, social contact, physical activity, maintenance/improvement work for a car or house, housework, and religious activity. Descriptive analyses were used to explore the prevalence and patterns of activity participation. Through descriptive analyses and logistic regression, continuity and change of activity participation into retirement were examined. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore contributing factors for post-retirement activity participation. Findings suggest substantial continuity of activity participation into retirement for all eight activities. Possible explanations for retirement-related changes in activity participation include factors such as having more discretionary time (e.g., with social contact and religious activity) and the mediating effect of employment (e.g., with formal volunteer work). Findings also suggest increased post-retirement participation in activities that are based on interpersonal emotion or social interaction (e.g., social contact and religious activity) and the importance of social environment and social relationship in post-retirement activity participation (e.g., formal and informal volunteer participation). Findings, however, do not support formal volunteer work as a substitute for paid work. Applicability of Lawton's model of activity participation in this study may be limited due to omitted variables, qualitative differences in activities, and the static nature of the model. Implications for programs include pre-retirement recruitment for formal volunteer work and interorganizational efforts to assist older adult retirees with building an informal social network. Further research needs to consider qualitative differences in the nature of activities in order to better understand contributing factors for retirement-related changes in activity participation. Research also needs to be directed towards more comprehensive model development to better understand retirees' decision-making processes regarding their use of time.

AB  - We provide non-experimental evidence of the relevance of sociability to subjective well-being by investigating the determinants of life satisfaction on a sample of Europeans aged above 49. Departing from the neoclassical Homo economicus paradigm of human behaviour, we document that voluntary work, religious attendance, helping friends/neighbours and participation in community-related organisations affect life satisfaction positively and significantly. Moreover, different combinations between actions and motivations generate differential effects on life satisfaction, thereby providing support to the importance of these specific 'contingent goods' and to the literature of procedural utility. Our empirical findings are confirmed in robustness checks including refinements of the dependent variable, instrumental variables and sensitivity analysis on departures from the exogeneity assumption.

AB  - Summary: The hypothesis that active community involvement is beneficial for health finds strong support in the medical literature and in most policy guidelines for active ageing in OECD countries. We test it empirically and find that voluntary work has a significant impact on several measures of mental wellbeing. When accounting for fixed effects, panel attrition, endogeneity, and reverse causality, the positive effect of voluntary work remains robust. For the first time in the literature, we calculate the monetary equivalent of mental wellbeing benefits of voluntary work with the compensating variation approach, and estimate them up to a maximum of around 9,500 euros per indicator. Our results imply that policies fostering voluntary work of the elderly would contribute to active ageing and the wellbeing of the elderly and reduce welfare costs for society. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Research demonstrates that volunteering provides many benefits for individuals and communities. However, research has not adequately addressed the potential significance of volunteering as a mechanism for low-income individuals to improve their own lives and support their communities. To account for the benefits volunteering could generate, research must shift from an emphasis on what low-income volunteers lack to an approach that uncovers the strengths and wealth present among low-income volunteers and their communities. The purpose of this article is to present a theoretically informed asset-based framework for analyzing volunteerism research. Through an examination of four nonfinancial assets--social capital, human capital, cultural capital, and political capital--we illustrate how an asset-based approach offers an opportunity to explore the ways low-income individuals could build and leverage assets through volunteering. Implications for future research that frames volunteering as an asset-building strategy are considered.

AB  - <bold><italic>Combining multiple roles by older adults: does it reduce or enhance wellbeing?</italic></bold> Older adults increasingly combine employment with informal care and/or voluntary work. This is good for society but raises the question whether combining multiple roles is also good for individual well-being. Based on data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (N = 1885), associations between role combinations, role intensity (in employment, informal care and volunteering) and well-being are examined using role enhancement and role strain perspectives. We investigate if social network and mastery (the feeling of control over his or her life) buffer potential negative effects of role combinations and role intensity on well-being. Intensive informal care is related with more depressive symptoms, which is fully mediated by mastery. Fulltime employment is related with lower levels of depressive symptoms, and this is fully mediated by mastery. Social network size does not mediate any relationship between role combinations or role intensities and depressive symptoms. Both parttime and fulltime employment are negatively related to depressive symptoms. The study suggests that combining roles is positively related to well-being when role strain is low. Interventions should be directed at maintaining mastery among those providing intensive informal care, in particular when combined with employment and/or volunteering.

AB  - Volunteering positively impacts on life satisfaction and mental well-being over the deciles of the distribution for a sample of the British populace from 1996 to 2008 (BHPS data set); however, this effect is decreasing for those in the upper parts of the well-being distribution. This can be seen as support for the contention that volunteering can play a protective role for individuals and increase their well-being in the face of otherwise unsatisfactory life conditions. Looking at the effect on satisfaction with life domains, there is evidence for a positive impact of volunteering on satisfaction with health, one's social life and amount and use of leisure time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of social capital with health and mortality is contentious, and empirical findings are inconsistent. This study tests the association of neighbourhood-level volunteerism with mortality. METHODS: Cohort study of 1996 New Zealand census respondents aged 25-74 years (4.75 million person years) using multilevel Poisson regression analyses. Neighbourhood (average population 2,034) measures included indices of social capital (volunteering activities for all census respondents) and deprivation. RESULTS: Adjusting for just age and marital status, the mortality rate ratios for people living in the quintile of neighbourhoods with the lowest compared with highest volunteerism were 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.24) and 1.09 (1.01-1.18), for males and females, respectively. Adjusting for potential individual-level and neighbourhood-level socioeconomic confounders reduced the rate ratios to 0.94 (0.88-1.01) and 0.92 (0.85-1.01), respectively. There was no significant association with any cause of death, including suicide [rate ratios 0.89 (0.64-1.22) and 0.57 (0.31-1.05), respectively]. Restricting the analyses to only those census respondents living at their census night address for five or more years, and therefore 'exposed' to that level of volunteerism for a longer period, did not substantially alter findings. CONCLUSIONS: This study, one of the largest multilevel studies yet, found no statistically significant independent association of a structural measure of neighbourhood social capital with mortality-including suicide. Assuming social features of neighbourhoods are important determinants of health, future research should examine other features (e.g. social fragmentation) and other outcomes (e.g. behaviour).

AB  - This paper has 2 purposes: (a) to present the differences in demographic and health characteristics of older women volunteers and nonvolunteers in a community-based sample; (b) to identify the motivations of current and past volunteers, as contrasted with those who have never volunteered. A population-based survey was conducted with a sample of 1,104 women aged 50 to 80 years in the state of Washington. Nonvolunteers were less likely to be married and were slightly less likely to be White than were current or past volunteers. Demographic variables (e.g., age) and health status predicted level of reported motivation for volunteering. These data provide us with population-based estimates of volunteering and motivations for older women.

AB  - Given population aging and the productive potential of older people, it is important to examine how individual and societal developments affect social engagement in later life. The study aimed to disentangle the effects of age, aging, and cohort on volunteering among the young old. Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, we examined volunteering rates of young olds (N = 2,745) in two decades: those being 55–69 years old in 1992 and their age-peers in 2002. Six-year follow-up on both cohorts allowed for cohort-sequential analyses. Multilevel logistic regression analyses revealed that (i) regardless of age, the 2002 cohort volunteered more often than the 1992 cohort, (ii) in 6 years’ time volunteering increased for the 55- to 59-year-olds, stabilized among the 60- to 64-year-olds, and declined among the 65- to 69-year-olds, and (iii) these age-differential changes were observed in both cohorts. These effects remained significant after adjusting for gender, education, religious involvement, health, employment status, network size, and partner status. A higher education, religious involvement, staying in good health, and maintaining a large network increased the likelihood of volunteering. Unobserved factors, such as a more positive view on aging within society, may also account for the large increase in volunteering among the recent cohort of young olds.

AB  - Quality of life (QOL) of older people is becoming an important public health concern and should be evaluated. The aim of this study was to evaluate socioeconomic and individual determinants of QOL of older subjects living in metropolitan Santiago, Chile. We first carried out a qualitative phase with focus groups of older people. According to the conclusions of the focus groups, a questionnaire about QOL was devised and added to the WhoQoL (World Health Organization Quality of Life) and WHOQoL-Old brief questionnarires. The final document with 85 questions was applied to healthy older subjects living in the community. A total of 1,676 subjects aged 71.8±7.4 years (1,189 women) took part in the survey. A multiple stepwise regression model showed that a higher socioeconomic level, a better educational level, performing voluntary work, having a partner, participating in groups with other older people, and being younger were factors independently associated with a higher QOL. A principal components analysis showed that psychological health and social relationships were the main domains that explained the total quality of life score. Psychological health and social relationships were the main determinants of QOL in this sample of older Chilean people living in metropolitan Santiago.

AB  - Interest in civic engagement focused on the natural environment has grown dramatically, as has the population of older adults. Our article explores the potential for increased environmental volunteerism among older adults to enrich the lives of volunteers while benefitting the community and environmental quality. Curiously, this convergence has been relatively neglected by researchers and program developers. We review existing literatures on trends in volunteerism, motivations, benefits, and barriers to participation, with a special focus on elements most relevant to older adults. Based on this review, we identify a number of critical areas of research, and pose key research questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Pathways responsible for higher-order thinking in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), or executive center of the brain, remain vulnerable throughout life-during critical early-life developmental windows, when the PFC fully matures in the early 20s, and finally from declines associated with old age. At all ages, physical activity and PFC-navigated social connections are essential components to maintaining brain health. The Experience Corps, a community-based social-engagement program, partners seniors with local schools to promote purpose-driven involvement. Participating seniors have exhibited immediate short-term gains in brain regions vulnerable to aging, such as the PFC, indicating that people with the most to lose have the most to gain from environmental enrichment.

AB  - Volunteering in late life is associated with health benefits such as reduced risk of hypertension, improved self-related health and well-being, delayed physical disability, enhanced cognition, and lower mortality. Although the mechanisms of these correlations are not clear, increases in physical activity, cognitive engagement, and social interactions likely play contributing roles. Volunteers are typically thought to represent a select group, often possessing higher levels of education and income, good health, and strong social networks. However, group evidence indicates that there are many members of groups of lower socioeconomic status (SES), including elderly adults, who serve their communities on a regular basis and in high-priority programs. We propose that the impact of volunteering in an aging population be recognized and invested into, and that effective programs harness social capital of older adults to address critical societal needs and also improve the well-being of older adults. While members of low-SES groups are less likely to volunteer, they exhibit disproportionately great benefits. The Experience Corps represents a model of an effective volunteerism program, in which elders work with young schoolchildren. Existing federal initiatives, including the Foster Grandparent Program and Senior Companion Program--which target low-income elders--have had low participation with long waiting lists. Given the proven benefits and relatively low proportion of older persons who volunteer, enhancement of elder volunteerism presents a significant opportunity for health promotion and deserves consideration as a national public health priority.

AB  - Objectives: Loneliness is a significant public health concern, particularly for those who have lost a spouse through widowhood. This study examines whether becoming a volunteer at the time of widowhood is associated with reduction of these risks. Method: A pooled sample of 5,882 married adults age 51+, drawn from the 2006-2014 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, was used to estimate regression models of the relationship between becoming widowed (relative to staying continuously married) and loneliness, and whether the associated loneliness of having lost a spouse is moderated by starting to volunteer (<2 hr, 2+ hr/week). Results: Our results show that for those who become widowed, loneliness is significantly higher than those who stay continuously married. However, starting to volunteer 2+ hr per week is related to attenuated loneliness among the widowed such that widows who volunteer at that intensity have levels of loneliness similar to those of continuously married individuals volunteering at the same intensity. Discussion: This study suggests higher intensity volunteering may be a particularly important pathway for alleviating loneliness among older adults who have recently become widowed. Results are discussed in light of theory, future research, and potential interventions.

AB  - This study in Spain explored three aspects of older adult volunteering (motivations, satisfaction, and perceptions of benefits and drawbacks) and examines to what extent these aspects are influenced by the type of organization and other factors (sociodemographic variables and level of volunteering). The sample consisted of 88 older adults volunteering in 3 different organizations: management, cultural actions, and social care. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results show that volunteering is a satisfying activity for older adults. Participants perceived more benefits than drawbacks and had diverse motivations for volunteering. Volunteering in a management organization predicted less satisfaction and perception of benefits, as well as greater drawbacks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study focuses on the ways in which social worker induction into volunteer work sustain the well-being of older people. The study surveyed 719 Chinese people aged 60 or above in Hong Kong, China. Results show significant contribution of social worker induction to the older person's self-esteem, life satisfaction, and self assessed health. Moreover, social worker induction magnified the benefit of volunteering. However, social worker induction was less salutary to older people with higher incomes and more illness.

AB  - With the variation of resources and norms in society, the effects of resources and norms on the well-being of individuals are likely to change. People's age, education, family income, religiosity, voluntary organizational membership, and even protest participation can be considered resources and can maintain fits to local and global liberal norms. Specifically, local norms rest on popularity and valuation in societies. This paper studies the hypothesized effects of resources and normative fits and analyzes data collected from the World Values Survey of 2252 adults in 2005 and 2014 in Hong Kong, China. Results mostly support the resource and normative fit hypotheses. Age, family income, and active voluntary organizational membership are more salutary in 2014 than in 2005. By contrast, education and religious affiliation became less salutary in 2014 than in 2005. In support of the normative fit hypothesis but against the resource hypothesis, protest participation appeared to diminish well-being. Results present implications for enhancing well-being by fostering resources and normative fits.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to the complexity associated with health care coverage and its utilization by older people, I hypothesize that social engagement promotes a better later-life general cognitive status beyond health care availability as is provided by Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) system. The present study thus explores whether social engagement, specifically social participation and volunteer work, is independently associated with later-life general cognitive status after adjusting for health service utilization among older Taiwanese via the NHI system. METHODS: Using a population-based natural experiment study design, data from the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA, 1993-2007) was analyzed. Mixed-effects models were conducted to estimate the relative effects of volunteer work, social participation, and NHI on general cognitive status over time, while taking health status, medical care utilization, community development, and social support into consideration. RESULTS: The multivariate findings showed that a better general cognitive status is significantly associated with being actively involved in volunteer work (beta=0.14, p<0.01) and social participation (beta=0.14, p<0.01). In addition, NHI is also significantly associated with a higher level of general cognitive status (beta=0.10, p<0.01). DISCUSSION: This investigation suggests that social engagement has significant impacts on late-life general cognitive status, even taking into account the NHI system and its related utilization effects. The results highlight the importance of volunteer work and social participation among older Taiwanese because such social involvement produces a positive effect on their general cognitive status beyond health care itself. Furthermore, the contribution of productive activities to enhance late-life cognitive health is underscored.

AB  - Aim: Many older adults face limitations to participating in active leisure activities as a result of their physical constraints from aging. Passive leisure activities become alternative leisure activities for older adults as a result of limited physical capacity. The present study sought to determine whether there exists a difference in the frequency of participation in passive and active leisure activities, and the effect of participation in passive and active leisure activities on the life satisfaction level of old adults. Methods: A total of 460 participants aged 60–95 years were randomly selected from 21 sites in the USA. The Life Satisfaction Index – Z and the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment were analyzed to examine older adults' life satisfaction and frequency of active or passive activities. Results: The results showed that participation in passive leisure activities, such reading, talking on the telephone and watching TV/listening to the radio, is more frequent among older adults (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000). The regression coefficient found that club/organization or volunteering (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008), homemaking/maintenance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.017) and traveling (<italic>P</italic> = 0.017) for active leisure activities were statistically significant predictors of Life Satisfaction Index – Z for older adults. Conclusions: The current study shows that older adults spent much more times participating in passive leisure activities, such as radio/watching TV, talking on the phone and reading. The result also showed that active leisure activities, such as club/organization or volunteering, home making/maintenance and traveling, were significant predictors of life satisfaction for older adults controlling for covariates. The current study suggests marketing and programming plans to overcome the constraints that influence older adults' life satisfaction. <bold>Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 380–386</bold>.

AB  - This study examined the unique effects of four variable groups on changes in older adults' depressive symptoms for a 2-year period: (1) baseline health and disability status, (2) changes in health and disability since baseline, (3) stability and changes in marital and caregiving status and in work and volunteering, and (4) stability and changes in health-related behaviors. With data from the 1998 and 2000 interview waves of the Health and Retirement Study, the authors used gender-separate multistep (hierarchical) residualized regression analyses in which the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D) score at follow-up is modeled as a function of the effect of each group of independent variables. As hypothesized, changes in health, disability, marital, and caregiving status explained a larger amount of variance than the existing and stable conditions, although each group of variables explained a relatively small amount (0.3-3.4%) of variance in the follow-up CES-D score.

AB  - This study examined the longitudinal relationships between functional health in later years and three types of productive activities: volunteering, full-time, and part-time work. Using the data from five waves (2000–2008) of the Health and Retirement Study, we applied multivariate latent growth curve modeling to examine the longitudinal relationships among individuals 50 or over. Functional health was measured by limitations in activities of daily living. Individuals who volunteered, worked either full time or part time exhibited a slower decline in functional health than nonparticipants. Significant associations were also found between initial functional health and longitudinal changes in productive activity participation. This study provides additional support for the benefits of productive activities later in life; engagement in volunteering and employment are indeed associated with better functional health in middle and old age.

AB  - Aim The aim of the present study was to examine a relationship between altered social activity and quality of life in later life. Methods Data came from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2006-2012), which consisted of 7096 participants aged 45 years or older. Change in social activity was classified into four categories; that is, 'consistent non-participation,' 'participation to no participation,' 'no participation to participation' and 'consistent participation.' Social activity was divided into various elements, and the same analysis was carried out for each element. The linear mixed model was used to investigate the association between changes in social activity and quality of life among middle-aged and elderly Koreans. Results Those with changes from 'participation to no participation' (b 2.253, P < 0.0001), 'no participation to participation' (b 3.348, P < 0.0001) and 'consistent participation' (b 6.624, P < 0.0001) were more likely to be satisfied with their lives than those with 'consistent non-participation' ( P < 0.0001 for trend). In addition, the impact of the positive relationship between consistent participation in social activity and quality of life varied across different elements of social activity. The positive association was particularly strong for religious activities, friendship organization, leisure/culture clubs, family/school reunion and voluntary work (b 1.451, P < 0.0004; b 5.049, P < 0.0001; b 4.903, P < 0.0001; b 4.757, P < 0.0001; b 4.562, P < 0.0001; respectively, for consistent participation vs consistent non-participation). Conclusion Consistent participation in religious activities, friendship organizations, leisure/culture clubs, family/school reunion ,and volunteer work improves quality of life among middle aged and older Koreans.

AB  - Although accumulated research findings point to both short- and long-term salutary effects of time volunteering on older adults' physical and mental health, little research has been done on the effect of older adults' making charitable donations on their wellbeing. Guided by activity theory and the theory of volunteering and using data from the first and second waves of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS, 1995–1996 and MIDUS II, 2004–2006), this study examined the question of whether time volunteering and charitable donations nine years earlier had a positive direct effect on psychological wellbeing among individuals age 55 and above. Controlling for time 1 (T1) psychological wellbeing and T1 human, cultural, and social capital resources, a moderate amount (up to ten hours monthly) of T1 time volunteering and any amount of T1 charitable donations had a direct positive effect on time 2 (T2; nine years later) psychological wellbeing. The findings also show a greater effect on psychological wellbeing of any amount of charitable donations than of any amount of time volunteering, although the extent of the effect of both time volunteering and charitable donations was small. With regard to human, cultural, and social capital resources, T1 self-rated health and generative quality were significant predictors of T2 psychological wellbeing, but T1 social capital had no significant effect on T2 psychological wellbeing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study measures the impact of volunteering type and intensity on different aspects of physical activity including meeting recommended activity guidelines and level of intensity. METHODS: Four waves and eight years of longitudinal data on a nationally representative sample of Americans, 50 and older were used. RESULTS: As predicted, volunteering was associated with increased physical activity with respect to likelihood to meet guidelines and higher intensity of physical activity after adjusting for baseline age, gender, education, self-rated health and comorbidities and physical activity. Volunteers were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines and to maintain a higher likelihood of meeting guidelines than non-volunteers. In addition, volunteers were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, report decreases in functional limitation or decreases in self-rated health than those who did not volunteer. Number of hours of volunteering was significantly and positively associated with increased likelihood to meet guidelines. Finally, analyses found that older adults who volunteered with children had lower likelihood of depression and improvements in several psychosocial variables including social network and social support scores compared to older adults who volunteered but did not volunteer with children. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that volunteering could be a mechanism to help older adults meet and maintain the meeting of physical activity guidelines over time. Volunteering also appears to be associated with reduction of depressive symptoms, functional limitations and decreases in self-rated health over time. Finally, volunteering with children could act as a buffer to mediate lower social support and reports of negative familial support. The amount of volunteering required to confer maximum health benefits should be further explored. Future studies should also further examine the casual relationship between volunteering and physical activity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This correlational, nonexperimental study examined the relationships among gerotranscendence, gender, age, status as a senior companion volunteer or agency client, presence of social support in the home, perceptions toward aging, and perception of health in older adults participating in a senior companion program. The sample included 68 senior companion volunteers and 48 agency clients. Results indicated that the progression of gerotranscendence was not related to gender (t (114) = -.321, p=.749), age (F (3,115) = .009, p=.99), status as volunteer or client (t (114) = -.297, p=.749) or presence of social support in the home (t (114) = -.163, p=.104). There was a positive correlation between progression of gerotranscendence scores and perceptions of aging scores (r=.435, p=.01) and perception of health status scores (r=.381, p=.01). Perceptions of aging scores were positively correlated with perception of health scores (r=.644, p=.01). A stepwise multiple regression revealed that a positive perception of aging was the best predictor of gerotranscendence progression scores (R2 = .189, p<.001). The theory of gerotranscendence is a developmental theory which describes how individuals progress into old age and can provide a blueprint for the changes that may occur with aging. Findings of this study support Tornstam's claim that the developmental progression of aging described by the theory of gerotranscendence is healthy and positive.

AB  - This article reports on a social return on investment (SROI) analysis of volunteers of the Good Food Market program, a food access initiative run by FoodShare Toronto, one of Canada's largest food-justice organizations. Unlike conventional SROI research, which typically focuses on the entire ecology of an organization or program, this article focuses solely on isolating the return volunteers receive on their investment of time, skills, energy, and the like--an SROI of volunteering. The article reviews the challenges of adapting the SROI methodology to the context of volunteer benefits and finds that ultimately SROI is a useful tool for articulating the value of volunteering.

AB  - The population approaching social services for help is often characterized by poverty, passivity, helplessness, and an external locus of control. This population expects improvement in its situation but develops a dependent relationship with the help agents. The literature shows that volunteer work contributes toward developing empowerment among volunteers, but to date only a relatively small number of welfare clients have been activated as volunteers, serving more as the object of others' volunteer work. This article describes a classic experimental study, checking the connection between welfare clients' volunteering and their individual feeling of empowerment. The main and most significant finding in the study demonstrated that individual feeling of empowerment among clients who engaged in volunteer work was higher than that of clients not engaged in such work. The findings suggest that volunteer work may serve as an effective intervention tool in social work, whose aim is change in welfare clients' feelings of empowerment.

AB  - Civic participation constitutes a range of activities that strengthen participatory democracy, such as voting, volunteerism, association membership, or political and community activism. Factors associated with civic participation are community attachment, religious participation, and quality of life satisfaction. Using a sample of 55 adults, ages 18 to 92 years, the results indicate that this is an engaged sample group in the volunteer arena with high religious attendance, attachment to their communities, and average satisfaction with their quality of life as outcomes of their civic participation.

AB  - Aim Studies have indicated that altruistic behaviour may be associated with better health. Nevertheless, it has not been determined if volunteering acts as a protective factor against cognitive decline or if a person's altruistic character does so. This study aims to evaluate whether altruistic behaviour and volunteering are associated with better cognitive function in active community‐dwelling older persons. Methods This was a cross‐sectional study in healthy older persons. Sociodemographics, altruistic behaviour (self‐report altruism scale), volunteering (days volunteered), cognitive state (cognitive assessment battery), and factors associated with cognition (e.g. depression, social support, functional status, and religiosity) were evaluated. Adjusted and non‐adjusted models were created in order to understand the relationship of altruistic behaviour and volunteering with cognitive performance. Results A total of 312 older adults were evaluated; 89.4% were women, and the mean age was 69.6 years. In the linear regression models, greater altruistic behaviour was associated with higher scores on the Mini‐Mental State Examination (β = 0.148, P < 0.05) and the verbal fluency test (β = 0.219, P < 0.001), even after adjustments. In contrast, volunteering was not associated with any of the cognitive tests used. Conclusion Altruistic behaviour seems to have a role in older persons’ cognition, with more altruistic people tending to have greater cognitive performance. These findings can assist in developing mechanisms that can help keep older people more cognitively active and serve as the foundation for future interventions and studies in this area.

AB  - Investigated whether membership by the elderly in particular types of voluntary associations has a positive influence on the psychological well-being of older persons. Data from 2 national probability samples which provided information about 438 noninstitutionalized persons (90% White) ages 65 yrs or older were analyzed. Among 16 types of voluntary associations in one analysis and 17 types in another, membership in church-affiliated groups alone emerged as a significant, but weak predictor of life satisfaction and happiness. If further research can identify factors leading to higher levels of psychological well-being in church-affiliated volunteers, this information may be productively used by other voluntary associations.

AB  - Population ageing will lead to a dramatic change in Romania’s age structure. Future cohorts of older Romanians will be more numerous and they are likely to be more highly educated, be in better health, and have more discretionary time, all of which are characteristics conducive to high levels of volunteering. Despite the known benefits of involvement in voluntary activities, such participation is currently at an extremely low level among older Romanians. In addition to documenting these demographic trends, the benefits of volunteering, and current levels of voluntary activities, this article asks why voluntaristic participation is so low among older Romanians. Building on Stula’s notion that volunteering should be seen as an “instrument of health policy,” the article concludes by suggesting some steps that might be taken to encourage and promote voluntarism among Romanian elders.

AB  - Volunteerism in geriatric settings can enhance the emotional, social, and physical well-being of older adults. There are several salient features embodied in the act of caring. These include levels of knowing, patience, and courage, which subsumes trust and hope. Intrinsic to the concept of genuine caring are the volunteer's abilities to empathize with, empower, and engage the geriatric client. The need for the volunteer to be humble, in the sense of being ready to learn from the cared for person, and for the volunteer to learn and use active listening skills is noted.

AB  - Population ageing is a ffectingall western countries. The average age of people is increasing and older people constitute a larger proportion of our society. In response to this evolution, Flemish local policymakers became aware of the need to develop evidence-based local senior policy plans. This contribu tion seeks to reflect on the challenges and opportunities of involving older people in research, policy and social change at the local level. In particular, it focuses on 'Belgian Ageing Studies', a research program which monitors the needs and quality of life among home-dwelling old er people (e.g. on housing, community, participation, care) in order to provide tools fo r evidence-based 'age-friendly' policies at the local level. The research program was developed in co-creation w ith older people, senior associations, senior advisory boards, local authorities, and other stakeholders. Older people are involved in this research as experts and actors by playing a significant role in the development of the study as well as the data collection and the evaluation (peer-research). In 10 years time, over 80 000 older respondents and 8000 older volunteers participated in the research program. The process of the BASprogram in which older people actively engage as participants and develop a sense of co-ownership shows how participatory research can play a role in promoting evidence-based senior policies. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Een van de grote uitdagingen waarmee westerse maatschappijen het jongste decennium geconfronteerd worden, is vergrijzing. De bevolking w ordt gemiddeld steeds ouder en ook proportioneel gezien zal het aantal ouderen toenemen. Het hoeft dan ook n ie t de verwonderen dat Vlaamse, lokale besturen zich aan het begin van de eenentwintigste eeuw bewust werden van de nood om een beleid te ontwikkelen dat focust op vergrijzing en ouder worden. Deze bijdrage wil reflecteren over de uitdagingen en kansen om ouderen te betrekken in onderzoek, beleid en sociale veranderingen op lokaal niveau. In het bijzonder beticht het artikel 'Belgian Ageing Studies' (BAS), een onderzoeksprogramma dat tools ontwikkelde voor een evidence-based, participatief, leeftijdsvriendelijk ouderenbeleid. Het onderzoeksprogramma naar behoeften van ouderen (o.a. op het vlak van wonen, buurt, participatie, zorg) is ontwikkeld in co-creatie met ouderen, ouderenverenigingen, ouderenadviesraden, lokale overheden en andere stakeholders. Ouderen z ijn betrokken als deskundigen en actoren en ze speten een belangrijke rol in de ontwik keling en het verloop van de studie, alsook bij de dataverzameling en de evaluatie (peer-onderzoek). In 10 jaar tijd hebben meer dan 80.000 ouderen en 8000 oudere v rijw illig e rs deelgenomen in meer dan 170 Vlaamse gemeenten. Het proces van de BAS waarin ouderen actie f deelnemers en mede-eigenaars z ijn, laat zien hoe partic ipatie fonderzoek een rol kan spelen b ij het bevorderen van evidence-based ouderenbeleid, een beleid dat voornamelijk gebaseerd is op onderzoeksresultaten.

AB  - This article is a thematic reflection. It aims at presenting volunteer work as an alternative for promoting health for elders in Brazil. Having as a starting point the definition of volunteer work, this study contextualizes this type of activity in Brazilian society, explaining it also as an instrument that makes possible for people to experience an active and healthy aging process. The text presents international studies with elders who volunteer and, as a result, have found a relationship between volunteering and satisfaction with their lives and have had less symptoms of depression and a more positive evaluation of life when compared to elderly who do not volunteer. The conclusion emphasizes the importance for health professionals to stimulate and facilitate the access of elders to volunteer work, considering this posture a creative and innovative challenge for the promotion of health for the elderly.

AB  - Promoting social participation of the older population (e.g. membership in voluntary associations) is often seen as a promising strategy for 'healthy ageing' in Europe. Although a growing body of academic literature challenges the idea that the link between social participation and health is well established, some statistical evidence suggest a robust positive relationship may exist for older people. One reason could be that aged people have more time to take part in social activities (due to retirement, fewer familial constraints, etc.); so that such involvement in voluntary associations contributes to maintain network size for social and emotional support; and preserves individuals' cognitive capacities. Using SHARE data for respondents aged fifty and over in 2004, this study proposes to test these hypotheses by evaluating the contribution of social participation to self-reported health (SRH) in eleven European countries. The probability to report good or very good health is calculated for the whole sample (after controlling for age, education, income and household composition) using regression coefficients estimated for individuals who do and for those who do not take part in social activities (with correction for selection bias in these two cases). Counterfactual national levels of SRH are derived from integral computation of cumulative distribution functions of the predicted probability thus obtained. The analysis reveals that social participation contributes by three percentage points to the increase in the share of individuals reporting good or very good health on average. Higher rates of social participation could improve health status and reduce health inequalities within the whole sample and within every country. Our results thus suggest that 'healthy ageing' policies based on social participation promotion may be beneficial for the aged population in Europe.

AB  - This paper describes an initiative aimed at building the capacity of community volunteers to understand and meet the needs of an increasingly aged population with complex needs. It begins by providing an overview of the benefits of volunteering (for volunteers themselves, for recipients, and for society at large) and of the taxing effect frailty has on our healthcare system. This provides a backdrop against which we describe the conceptualization, design, and pilot evaluation of 'Lean on Me,' a four-part training program developed to enhance the way in which senior volunteers can support frail seniors’ participation in community programs.

AB  - In this paperwork, have started from the premise that seniors can represent a resource in the community by manifesting prosocial behavior and volunteering. One of the questions of interest here is focused on knowing the motivation of sessions to exercise prosocial behavior. A concept used to explain the activities carried out by seniors is that of volunteering. Through this article, I have developed an analysis of the volunteering activities carried out in the two rural-urban environments, focusing on available resources. On the other hand, we also analyzed the benefits of volunteering on seniors. The study materials used include both national and international studies on civic involvement and active ageing, with emphasis on senior volunteering. Subsequent research will be able to analyze how older people can be stimulated to engage in volunteering and contribute to community welfare. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Je pars par la prémisse que les seniors peuvent représenter une ressource dans la communauté en manifestant un comportement prosocial et le bénévolat. L'une des questions d'intérêt a porté sur la connaissance de la motivation à exercer un comportement prosocial par les seniors. Un concept utilisé pour expliquer les activités entreprises par les seniors est volontaire. À travers cet article, je me propose une analyse des activités volontaires menées dans les deux milieux ruraux-urbains, en mettant l'accent sur les ressources disponibles. Une analyse spéciale est faite sur les déterminants de ce comportement chez les seniors. D'autre part, j'ai analysé les avantages résultant de la pratique du bénévolat sur les seniors. Les matériaux d'étude utilisés comprennent des études au niveau national et international sur l'engagement civique et le vieillissement actif, en mettant l'accent sur le bénévolat des seniors. D'autres recherches seront en mesure d'analyser comment les personnes âgées peuvent être stimulées à s'engager dans des activités bénévoles et contribuer au bien-être de la communauté.

Una din întrebările de interes s-a axat pe cunoașterea motivației exercitării unui comportament prosocial de către seniori. Un concept utilizat în explicarea activităților desfășurate de către seniori este cel de voluntariat. Prin articolul de față mi-am prospus o analiză a activităților de voluntariat desfășurate în cele două medii rural-urban, cu accent pe resursele disponibile. O analiză aparte este făcută pe factorii determinanți ai acestui comportament în rândul seniorilor. Pe de altă parte am analizat și beneficiile ce rezultă din practicarea voluntariatului asupra seniorilor. Materialele de studiu utilizate cuprind studii atât la nivel național cât și internațional cu privire la implicarea civică și îmbătrânirea activă, cu accent pe voluntariatul seniorilor. Ulterioare cercetări vor putea analiza modul în care pot fi stimulate persoanele în vârstă pentru a se implica în activități de voluntariat și a contribui la bunăstarea comunității.

AB  - Using unique data from a large-scale online survey conducted in Germany, we examine gender differences in volunteering for charitable organisations. Our findings suggest that men are more likely than women to engage in regular volunteer activities. Additionally, we find that men devote more time to charitable causes than women. However, disaggregating the volunteer labour supply by different organisations reveals that women spend more time performing volunteer work for organisations that help the poor or elderly.

A corrected version of Table 1 on page 52 is presented. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in PA, Vol 82:1401.) Investigated paid and volunteer work among retired rural elderly persons and the relationship of these activities to satisfaction in retirement. Interviews were conducted with 252 men (aged 65–96 yrs) and 199 women (aged 66–86 yrs) in 2 rural counties. Satisfaction was assessed by the Retirement Descriptive Index (RDI). Both paid and volunteer work were significant predictors of RDI scores for men, while volunteer work was a significant predictor of RDI scores for women. Health also affected the relationship between work/volunteer activity and retirement satisfaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The literature reviewed In this chapter points to a number of conclusions regarding leisure activity in retirement. Retirees participate in many different kinds of activities including informal activities with friends and family; formal social participation in clubs, organizations, and volunteering; and individual solitary activities. These activities provide meaning through relaxation, personal growth, feelings of achievement, and giving back to the community. Retirees continue pre-retirement leisure activities and also engage in new leisure activities after retiring, thus supporting major theoretical perspectives in gerontology and adult development. Personal characteristics—in particular gender, health, and socioeconomic status—are correlated with leisure activity in retirement. Participation in leisure activities is associated with psychosocial and physical well-being in retirement, although the direction of causality is not clearly established. Future directions for research are identified. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives. Social participation has generated a wealth of research in gerontology, but the concept suffers from a lack of conceptual clarity that renders it difficult to define and measure. This means that research on social participation is difficult to compare directly. The aim of the present study was to draw the literature on social participation in older adults together to inform health services researchers seeking to investigate social participation as an indicator of successful aging. Methods. A narrative review of studies investigating the association between social participation and health in adults aged 65 years and older was conducted. Results. Three concepts of social participation (i.e. social connections, informal social participation and volunteering) were defined, their measurement instruments described and evidence of their associations with health explored. All three concepts have demonstrated associations with an array of health indicators. Prospective studies reveal that social participation at baseline is positively associated with mental and physical health. Conclusion. A model of social participation on health is presented, showing the evidence that all three concepts contribute to the association between social participation and health through their shared mechanisms of social support and social cohesion with the wider community. Using an instrument that can be separated into these three distinct concepts will assist health services researchers to determine the relative effect of each form of participation on the health of older adults.

AB  - Objectives: This study sought to understand the relationship between volunteer activity and happiness among a sample of older adult New Zealanders. It specifically sought to determine if ethnicity (Māori vs. non-Māori) and economic living standards (ELS) functioned as moderators of the relationship between volunteering and happiness. Method: Data were garnered from the 2008 administration of the New Zealand Health, Work, and Retirement Longitudinal Study. Correlational and multiple regression procedures were employed to examine study hypotheses. Results: Results from multiple regression analyses showed that the amount of volunteering per week was a unique predictor of the overall level of happiness. Moderation analyses indicated that ethnicity did not function as a moderator of the relationship between volunteering and happiness, but ELS did. Those with low ELS evidenced a stronger relationship between volunteering and happiness than those with high ELS. Results also indicated that Māori and those with low ELS volunteered more frequently than non-Māori and those with high ELS. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that volunteering is related to increased happiness, irrespective of ethnicity. It also provides further evidence that the relationship between volunteering and happiness is moderated by economic resources. Older individuals at the low end of the economic spectrum are likely to benefit more from volunteering than those at the high end.

AB  - The study examines a hybrid theory containing individual characteristics, resources, and social factors and volunteering of older adults living in Belgium. As scholars have pointed out the underresearched importance of taking the recruitment potential of older adults into account, this study investigates whether potential volunteers, actual volunteers, and non-volunteers in later life are different from each other in terms of individual characteristics (e.g., religiosity), resources (e.g., socioeconomic status), and social factors (e.g., social networks and social roles). Data for the present research were derived from the Belgian Aging Studies, a sample of 31,581 individuals aged 65 to 80 years. Logistic regression analyses indicate that altruistic and religious values, physical health, frequent contact with friends, and providing help to others are important predictors for potential volunteers as well as actual volunteers. Overall, the results indicate important insights for recruitment and retention of older volunteers.

AB  - Objectives: To examine associations between social ties and self-rated physical health among midlife and older African Americans. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of the 2005-2006 Milwaukee African American oversample of the second Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS II) study. Multivariate logistic regression examined associations between type of social ties (family or friends), their frequency (number of contacts), and their quality (support and strain) with better self-rated physical health (SRPH). We defined better SRPH to include self-reports of good, very good, or excellent SRPH: this category was compared with fair or poor SRPH. Control variables included demographic factors; social engagement characteristics such as working, volunteering, and caregiving; and measures of social structure such as types of discrimination experience and ratings of neighborhood quality. Results: In adjusted results, each additional degree of family support was associated with better self-rated physical health (odds ratio [OR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI], 1.14-2.22). Each additional reported incident of daily discrimination was associated with 9% lower odds of reporting better SRPH (OR, 0.91; CI, 0.83-0.99). Discussion: Results suggest quality of family support may contribute importantly to the health of African Americans. When working with midlife and older African Americans, providers should engage and support families as a vital resource to improve health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The elderly population is likely to increase rapidly in the countries of the East Mediterranean region in the next thirty years. It is therefore in the interest of all the region's societies to have the elderly participate actively in economic development. This participation may take the form of regular jobs, freelance work, or volunteer activity, depending on individual needs, preferences, and capacities. From a public health perspective, features commonly associated with aging include decline of physical activity, multiple pathologies, iatrogenic factors, drug interaction and medication adjustment, socioeconomic decline aggravated by war and poverty, the double burden of communicable and noncommunicable diseases, depression, and memory decline. These risks affect the quality of life of elderly and create the need for community-based health approaches. Helping older people to remain as healthy and active as possible should be regarded as a necessity rather than a luxury. This help may take the form of prevention and reduction of such burdens as avoidable disability, chronic and acute diseases, and premature mortality.

AB  - Sustained engagement in volunteering and its correlates have been examined in many studies across the globe. However, there is a dearth of research that explores the perspectives of long-term formal volunteers on the nature of changes perceived in oneself as a result of volunteering. Moreover, the linkages between psychological well-being and volunteering have been insufficiently explored. The present study was aimed at addressing these gaps. A heterogeneous sample of 20 long-term formal volunteer engaged in volunteering across different voluntary organisations in a southern metropolitan Indian city formed the primary sample for the study. In addition, a group of 21 short-term volunteers, matched on age, income and gender, was utilised for comparison with long-term volunteers on well-being indices. A semi structured interview schedule was used to explore self-perceived changes attributable to volunteering experience. In addition, a few standardised measures were used to comprehensively assess subjective well-being and psychological well-being. The interview data provided rich descriptions of perceived positive changes in self across cognitive, behavioral and emotional domains. Mirroring these patterns, the quantitative analyses indicated that long-term volunteers experienced higher levels of psychological well-being (sense of mastery and competence, self-acceptance and sense of engagement and growth) than short-term volunteers. The potential mechanisms involved in beneficial outcomes of long-term volunteering and implications for further research are highlighted.

AB  - This study analyses the relationships between cognitive performance, social participation and behavioural risks, taking into account age and educational attainment. We examine individual data for 11 European countries and Israel from the first wave of the Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The stochastic frontier approach methodology enables us to identify different sources of plasticity on cognitive functioning while taking into account age-related decline in cognitive performance. Several social participation variables were examined: employment status, attending educational courses, doing voluntary or charity work, providing help to family, friends or neighbours, participating in sports, social or other clubs, in a religious organisation and in a political or community organisation, and we controlled for age, education, income, physical activity, body-mass index, smoking and drinking. In the pooled sample, the results clearly show that all kinds of social involvement enhance cognitive functions, in particular in work. Moreover, behavioural risks such as physical inactivity, obesity, smoking or drinking were clearly detrimental to cognitive performance. Models for men and women were run separately. For both genders, all social involvement indicators associated with better cognitive performance. The results varied by countries, however, particularly the signs of the associations with a number of indicators of social involvement and behavioural risks.

AB  - In this article, the authors examine the growing phenomenon of environmental volunteering in later life, including the extent and the possible beneficial effects on older individuals. They explore the approach of environmental organizations toward older volunteers and suggest ways that they can make the most of such involvement. The article is based on data from a series of studies (including large-scale surveys and smaller in-depth interview projects) the authors conducted to shed light on the causes and consequences of environmental volunteering in later life.

AB  - Against the background of the ongoing demographic change the negative impacts of population ageing has recently been more and more confronted with the positive concept of 'productive ageing'. This concept stresses that an ageing population does not only result in increasing social costs. In fact even after retirement older people contribute to social wealth by productive activities like volunteering or caring for relatives or grandchildren. The paper describes the opportunities as well as the limitations of 'productive ageing' concepts and stresses the importance of a balance between activity and passivity. Such a balance should not only be preferred for ethical but also for economic reasons.

AB  - In view of the steady growth in life expectancy in recent decades the question is increasingly being raised whether and how older people should be encouraged to be more active, and particularly to engage in unpaid voluntary work. Taking adult life as a whole the conditions for such charitable involvement would appear to be especially favourable after retirement. However, these analyses, which are based on German longitudinal data, show that the effect of entering retirement is often exaggerated. Rather, the individual's previous volunteering experiences are of major importance in his decision to take up and continue voluntary work in later life. At the same time the analyses show how important the major resources of health and education are, particularly for participation in voluntary work during ageing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives. We tested whether social integration protects against memory loss and other cognitive disorders in late life in a nationally representative US sample of elderly adults, whether effects were stronger among disadvantaged individuals, and whether earlier cognitive losses explained the association (reverse causation). Methods. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 16638), we examined whether social integration predicted memory change over 6 years. Memory was measured by immediate and delayed recall of a 10-word list. Social integration was assessed by marital status, volunteer activity, and frequency of contact with children, parents, and neighbors. We examined growth-curve models for the whole sample and within subgroups. Results. The mean memory score declined from 11.0 in 1998 to 10.0 in 2004. Higher baseline social integration predicted slower memory decline in fully adjusted models (P<.01). Memory among the least integrated declined at twice the rate as among the most integrated. This association was largest for respondents with fewer than 12 years of education. There was no evidence of reverse causation. Conclusions. Our study provides evidence that social integration delays memory loss among elderly Americans. Future research should focus on identifying the specific aspects of social integration most important for preserving memory.

AB  - Population aging portends a crisis of resources and values. Desired solutions could include intergenerational strategies to harness the untapped potential of older adults to address societal needs and to generate health improvements for older adults. Despite the desire of many older adults to remain socially engaged and productive, the creation of productive roles has lagged. This report describes the conceptual framework and major design features of a new model of health promotion for older adults called Experience Corps. Experience Corps operates at, and leads to benefits, across multiple levels, including individuals, schools, and the larger community. At the individual level, we propose a model based on Erikson's concept of generativity to explain how and why Experience Corps works. At the level of schools, we propose a parallel model based on social capital. Experience Corps is a volunteer service program designed to improve the lives of urban children and to yield health improvement for older persons. It illustrates how population aging creates new opportunities to address difficult social problems. This article explores how the linkage of concepts at multiple levels motivates a potentially cost-effective, feasible, and high-impact program.

AB  - A research study surveyed 539 older volunteers from congregations who were actively involved in community service, as well as 430 older congregational attenders who were not involved in volunteer service, to understand the relationship between volunteering and faith development in later life. Findings show that older adult volunteers report higher levels of faith maturity, faith practices, life satisfaction, and motivation to serve than their non-volunteering counterparts. Accounting for barriers to volunteering such as health, transportation, caregiving, and work responsibilities did not significantly affect the faith and volunteer relationship. These findings have important implications for how religious educators and congregational social workers can nurture the life of faith of older volunteers through meaningful community ministry experiences.

The econometric analysis employs data provided by the Income and Living Conditions Survey for the United Kingdom carried out by the European Union's Statistics (UK-SILC) in 2006. Based on 2SLS, treatment effect and recursive bivariate probit models, and religious participation as instrument variable, and controlling for social and cultural capital, our results show a positive effect of formal volunteering on self-perceived health.

AB  - Abstract: Background: As the population ages, older adults are seeking meaningful, and impactful, post-retirement roles. As a society, improving the health of people throughout longer lives is a major public health goal. This paper presents the design and rationale for an effectiveness trial of Experience Corps™, an intervention created to address both these needs. This trial evaluates (1) whether senior volunteer roles within Experience Corps™ beneficially impact children's academic achievement and classroom behavior in public elementary schools and (2) impact on the health of volunteers. Methods: Dual evaluations of (1) an intention-to-treat trial randomizing eligible adults 60 and older to volunteer service in Experience Corps™, or to a control arm of usual volunteering opportunities, and (2) a comparison of eligible public elementary schools receiving Experience Corps™ to matched, eligible control schools in a 1:1 control:intervention school ratio. Outcomes: For older adults, the primary outcome is decreased disability in mobility and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Secondary outcomes are decreased frailty, falls, and memory loss; slowed loss of strength, balance, walking speed, cortical plasticity, and executive function; objective performance of IADLs; and increased social and psychological engagement. For children, primary outcomes are improved reading achievement and classroom behavior in Kindergarten through the 3rd grade; secondary outcomes are improvements in school climate, teacher morale and retention, and teacher perceptions of older adults. Summary: This trial incorporates principles and practices of community-based participatory research and evaluates the dual benefit of a single intervention, versus usual opportunities, for two generations: older adults and children.

AB  - We launched a new intervention study called REPRINTS in which senior volunteers engaged in reading picture books to children. Sixty-nine volunteers and 72 participants in a control group, all aged 60 years and over, living in three urban locations, participated in a baseline health checkup in June 2004. After completion of a three-month training seminar, volunteers visited public elementary schools and kindergartens in groups of 6 to 10 for an 18 month period. They were assessed again by a follow-up health checkup in March 2006. At the follow-up, social network scores (frequency of contact with grandchildren and others around the neighborhood) and self-rated health improved or was maintained at a significantly higher rate for the 37 individuals volunteering most intensively as compared to those who did not volunteer or volunteered minimally. In conclusion, through intensively being engaged in the intergenerational volunteer programs during 21 months, self-rated health and social networks were more likely to improve or be maintained among senior volunteers than controls.

AB  - The social and economic integration of older people is a theme that recurs whenever the Community institutions address the problem of the aging population. This issue is of great importance for the future of the European Union not only because the elderly account for nearly one-fifth of the population and marginalized people are those who have most need of social support, but also in relation to several lines of evidence concerning the importance of social relationships for health promotion and well being of the ageing population. A great resource for older people with health problems is made up of people close to them or otherwise available, on which the elderly can rely for support. Moreover, the need to forge new ties, especially among the widowed or childless persons, finds a possible solution through active participation in associations. In this chapter we describe the results of an analysis of the relationship between social integration indicators (which include the size of the individual social network, the degree of participation and voluntary work in civic associations, and the perception of neighborhood safety), with the perceived health status of a sample of 3,950 older people living in Finland, Hungary, The Netherlands, Germany and Italy. Other important variables involved are demographics, education, urban or rural living area. The results show that social capital is differently distributed among European countries. This finding is discussed referring to the Esping-Andersen classification of the European welfare models. Concerning social capital, data show that participating in association and feeling safe in the neighborhood are important factors for the health of older people, while the family network appears to be essential in case of bad health. Moreover health disparities based on socio-economic status were observed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper considers the relationship between social capital and health in the years before, at and after retirement. This adds to the current literature that only investigates this relationship in either the population as a whole or two subpopulations, pre-retirement and post-retirement. We now investigate if there are further additional subpopulations in the years to and from retirement. We take an information criteria approach to select the optimal model of subpopulations from a full range of potential models. This approach is similar to that proposed for linear models. Our contribution is to show how this may also be applied to nonlinear models and without the need for estimating subsequent subpopulations conditional on previous fixed subpopulations. Our main finding is that the association of social capital with health diminishes at retirement, and this decreases further 10 years after retirement. We find a strong positive significant association of social capital with health, although this turns negative after 20 years, indicating potential unobserved heterogeneity. The types of social capital may differ in later years (e.g. less volunteering) and hence overall social capital may have less of an influence on health in later years.

AB  - Reviews research on postretirement adjustment and states that the notion of crisis or rupture, as described by many gerontologists, has not been verified among recent retirees. There seems to be no actual proof that retirement, by itself, is responsible for the occurrence of somatic or psychological disorders. Depression appears to be equally frequent among retirees and older workers. The retiree's life is influenced by health, a desire to discontinue the drudgery of work, marital relations, and postretirement adjustment to new daily roles and activities. Two techniques are recommended to minimize the chance of depression among retirees: participation in volunteer work and a sequence of counseling sessions over the year following retirement.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of four variables on scores on the Purpose-in-Life Test (PIL). The four variables were relational status, work or volunteerism, spirituality, and mood. The participants were elderly people drawn from three senior citizen centers in northwestern Ohio. Elderly people were chosen because too often old age is seen as a time of decline. It need not be. Life may have meaning to the last breath, according to Viktor Frankl. The PIL was developed based on Frankl's concepts of existential vacuum and meaning in life. The test was administered to 130 seniors to discover if scores on the test were related to a person's relational status (living alone or with someone); if the person worked, volunteered, or was retired; how spiritual the person was; and if the person was depressed, as measured on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Multiple regression analyses were performed on the predictor variables and the criterion variable. Results suggested that relational status and employment were not significant predictors of scores on the PIL. Spirituality and depression remained in the equation as significant predictors of PIL scores. In separate analyses, relational and work satisfaction, as measured on a Likert Scale, recorded moderate to strong correlations with the PIL. Each variable was examined in detail and discussed in relation to its effects on elderly people. Finally, the study was summarized and recommendations for future research were made.

AB  - This chapter discusses several innovative approaches to gerontological social work that parallel the tactics used in social development. It begins by providing a demographic, economic, and sociocultural context of aging in the United States and other developed countries. Next, the concept of productive aging is described and used as a framework to discuss conventional social work interventions designed to address issues related to older adults. Then, the framework is used to present current innovations in gerontological social work that promote productive aging. Four areas of gerontological social work are highlighted: employment and retirement; volunteerism and civic engagement; informal caregiving; and investment in local, cross-sector planning and collaborative community development. Finally, implications and future directions for practice, research, and education in gerontological social work are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The benefits for older people of participating in regular activity are well documented. This paper focuses on how publicly funded community-based organizations enable older people to engage in physical activity. The research questions were: (i) What activity promotion schemes/initiatives exist for older people? (ii) Who has responsibility for them, how are they funded and organized and what evidence exists of interagency working? (iii) Who are the older people that participate? (iv) What are the perceived and measurable outcomes of the initiatives identified? To establish the type and range of provision for older people in a sector of London, the strategies and information about existing activity promoting schemes of inner city health, local government and voluntary organizations were reviewed. Key informants were then interviewed to establish the rationale, achievements and different schemes. One hundred and nine activity-promoting initiatives for older people were identified. Most were provided within an environment of short-term funding and organizational upheaval and reflected eclectic theoretical and ideological approaches. The findings demonstrate: (i) the need for organizations to apply evidence about what attracts and sustains older people's participation in physical activity, and (ii) the need to develop funded programmes that build on past achievements, have explicit outcomes and exploit opportunities for cross agency working.

AB  - ObjectiveTo measure health effects in lay volunteers who made home visits consisting of social interaction, nutritional and physical exercise interventions to pre-frail and frail older people (trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01991639).MethodsAfter baseline, participants were followed-up at 12 (V1) and 24 (V2) weeks. A one-repetition maximum (1-RPM) and handgrip were measured with the Concept2 (R) DYNO and adynamometer. The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly was used to assess physical activity, and Food Frequency Questionnaire and the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener for nutrition. Additionally, quality of life (QoL) was measured with the World Health Organization (WHO) quality of life brief questionnaire and anthropometric measurements were performed using bioelectrical impedance analysis.ResultsHandgrip values significantly increased from 32.147.94kg to 33.69 +/- 6.72kg at V1 and 34.36 +/- 6.96kg at V2. The 1-RPM on the leg press showed asignificant increase from 72.47 +/- 25.37kg to 78.12 +/- 23.77kg and 80.85 +/- 27.99kg, respectively. We observed asignificant decrease of protein intake from 0.38 +/- 0.26g/kgBW/day to 0.32 +/- 0.19g/kgBW/day and 0.26 +/- 0.16g/kgBW/day, respectively. There were no changes in physical activity, QoL and anthropometric measurements.ConclusionThe findings indicate that projects involving aging healthy volunteers may have additional limited health benefits.

AB  - Reports on a 4-yr longitudinal study of 60 females, aged 62-89 yrs. Data about their happiness and social activities were collected using the Affect Balance Scale and 9 measures of socially relevant activities, including 3 measures of media use, 3 of interpersonal interaction, and 3 of activities in voluntary associations. Direct relationships between happiness and social activity among elderly people were found. This finding was not spurious according to longitudinal data: activity increments were associated with happiness and decrements with unhappiness. Although these findings describe the overall picture, changes in activities may be more important to happiness among the most elderly persons interviewed than others.

AB  - Objectives: Although previous studies have indicated that declining functional health is associated with individuals' poorer psychological well-being, few studies have examined factors that can protect adults from the loss of well-being following functional decline. Guided by continuity theory, this study investigated the extent to which continuous participation in voluntary groups (recreational, religious, and civic) buffers individuals against the harmful psychological effects of developing functional limitations. Methods: Longitudinal data came from 4,646 respondents aged 35 to 92 in the National Survey of Families and Households (1987-1993) who reported having no functional limitations at Time 1. Results: Multivariate models controlling for sociodemographic factors, as well as psychological well-being at Time 1, indicated that developing functional limitations over a 5-year period was associated with greater increases in depressive symptoms and lower levels of personal growth. Increases in depressive symptoms, however, were less severe among men who were continuously involved in recreational groups than among men who were not continuously involved in recreational groups. Additionally, the association between developing functional limitations and lower levels of personal growth did not hold for men or women who continuously participated in religious groups. Discussion: Findings suggest that continuous participation in certain types of voluntary groups can moderate the problematic effects of developing functional limitations on psychological well-being.

AB  - Informal caregivers are a critical component of the US long-term care system, but caregivers often experience poor physical and mental health as a result of strain from the caregiving role. Engagement in community-based educational and volunteer activities contributes to older adult well-being, but previous studies have not assessed whether the effects of these types of engagement are different for older adults who are also caregivers. Using a sample of participants in educational and volunteer activities sponsored by a national nonprofit organization, we find that participants who are caregivers report more benefit from these community-based activities than their noncaregiving counterparts. Connecting caregivers to existing community-based activities may be an efficient strategy for improving caregiver well-being. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigated the extent to which participating in benevolent activities, such as volunteering in community organizations, is associated with higher levels of subjective well-being including: life satisfaction, perceived health, and happiness. In addition, the study explored whether the anticipated benefits of volunteering are related to the context of volunteering. That is to say, are the personal benefits of volunteering in secular contexts similar to, or different from, the anticipated personal benefits of volunteering in religious organizations? Furthermore, this research considered the role of spirituality as a potential contributor to volunteer behavior (secular or religious) and its role in understanding prosocial personality and well-being. Participants in the study consisted of volunteers from a hospice organization (N = 264) and a Christian congregation ( N = 213). Each participant received a survey which included questions pertaining to age, gender, hours spent volunteering, religious activity, perceived happiness, and financial strain. Major constructs of life satisfaction, prosocial personality, and spiritual well-being were assessed using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985), Prosocial Personality Battery (PSB) (Penner, Fritzsche, Craiger & Freifeld, 1995), and The Spiritual Well Being Scale (SWBS) (Paloutzian & Ellison, 1982). Although those who reported some volunteer activity during the past 12 months reported higher levels of life satisfaction than those who reported no volunteer activity, the increased levels of satisfaction were not significant. Volunteers from the hospice organization reported significantly higher levels of life satisfaction than did the volunteers from the congregational sample. Life satisfaction was significantly associated with higher levels of spiritual well-being, and prosocial personality. Levels of life satisfaction were not found to be related to frequency of worship attendance, age, and gender. Higher levels of perceived happiness and general physical well-being did correlate with higher levels of life satisfaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article addresses the implications of 'resource frontier aging' with a particular emphasis on understanding the role of the voluntary sector in supporting older people living in resource hinterland regions, and in sustaining economic and social development in their communities. Informed by recent calls for greater attention to the diverse experiences of rural aging, individually and collectively, and drawing on previous research on voluntarism in aging rural communities and on community development in Canada's resource hinterland, we conceptualize voluntarism as a multifaceted process that both shapes and is shaped by the interactions between older people and aging places. We articulate an approach for interrogating initiatives that link voluntarism, aging, and community development together, and present findings from an exploratory analysis of local media from two resource towns in northern British Columbia to identify and describe the interrelationship between voluntary sector activities in support of community development and those in support of aging in place. The findings provide evidence of the multiple, nuanced, and reciprocal ways in which voluntarism creates and reinforces the connections between aging and community development, often via the leadership and participation of older residents. Avenues for further research aimed at developing an in-depth understanding of voluntarism as a potentially transformative process in resource frontier communities are discussed. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Résumé Cet article a pour objet d'étudier les conséquences du « vieillissement dans les régions ressources éloignées » et s'intéresse tout particulièrement au rôle du bénévolat à la fois dans le soutien aux personnes âgées vivant dans des régions ressources de l'arrière pays et dans l'essor du développement économique et social au sein de leurs communautés. S'inspirant des appels récents visant à porter davantage attention à la diversité des expériences du vieillissement rural autant sur les plans individuels que collectifs et tirant parti des travaux de recherche sur le bénévolat dans les communautés rurales vieillissantes et sur le développement communautaire dans les régions ressources de l'arrière pays du Canada, le concept du bénévolat que nous avons élaboré renvoie à un processus aux multiples dimensions qui façonne et est façonné par les interactions entre les personnes âgées et les lieux vieillissants. Notre démarche est définie dans le but de sonder des initiatives qui intègrent le bénévolat, le vieillissement et le développement communautaire. Les constats que nous dégageons d'une étude exploratoire menée sur les médias locaux dans deux villes ressources du nord de la Colombie-Britannique permettent d'identifier et de décrire les relations entre les activités du secteur bénévole qui soutiennent le développement communautaire et celles qui soutiennent le vieillissement sur place. Ces constats révèlent que le bénévolat participe de multiples façons et de manière nuancée et réciproque à la création et au renforcement des liens établis entre le vieillissement et le développement communautaire qui résultent souvent de la prise en charge par des résidents plus âgés eux-mêmes. L'article se termine par des éléments de réflexion pour orienter les nouvelles recherches en vue de contribuer à l'approfondissement de nos connaissances sur le bénévolat en tant que processus de transformation possible dans les communautés ressources éloignées.

AB  - Objectives: Being and feeling generative, defined as exhibiting concern and behavior to benefit others, is an important developmental goal of midlife and beyond. Although a growing body of evidence suggests mental and physical health benefits of feeling generative in later life, little information exists as to the modifiability of generativity perceptions. The present study examines whether participation in the intergenerational civic engagement program, Experience Corps (EC), benefits older adults’ self-perceptions of generativity. Method: Levels of generativity were compared in older adults randomized to serve as EC volunteers or controls (usual volunteer opportunities) in the Baltimore Experience Corps Trial at 4-, 12-, and 24-month evaluation points over the 2-year trial. Analyses utilized intention-to-treat and complier average causal effects (CACE) analyses which incorporate degree of intervention exposure in analytic models. Results: Participants randomized to the EC group had significantly higher levels of generative desire and perceptions of generative achievement than controls at each follow-up point; CACE analyses indicate a dose–response effect with a greater magnitude of intervention effect with greater exposure to the EC program. Discussion: Results provide the first-ever, large-scale experimental demonstration that participation in an intergenerational civic engagement program can positively alter self-perceptions of generativity in older adulthood.

AB  - Objectives: This review aims to advance understanding of the potential benefits of volunteering in the community for older adults' cognitive functioning by taking an in-depth look at the relevant evidence to date. Method: This review describes the main pathways through which volunteering could plausibly benefit cognitive functioning and critically examines research that has specifically investigated links between volunteering and cognition. Fifteen articles that assessed in adults aged > 55 years the relationship between volunteering (predictor) and cognitive functioning (outcome) were identified via literature database searches. Results: On balance, evidence from the small number of relevant studies to date supports the idea that volunteering can protect against cognitive aging with respect to global functioning and at least some specific cognitive domains. Studies that used robust designs and assessed domain-specific cognitive functioning produced the largest effect sizes. Discussion: To help advance the field, this review puts forward recommendations for future research, with an emphasis on the need for robust study designs and specific investigations into the nature and extent of the cognitive benefits of volunteering. Through that work, researchers can determine how a simple and accessible activity like volunteering can best be used to help reduce the burden of age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - Background: Thus far, only a few longitudinal studies investigated the impact of social engagement on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and depressive symptoms in old age. Therefore, we aimed to examine the impact of social engagement on HRQoL and depressive symptoms in late life. Methods: Individuals aged 75 years and over at baseline were interviewed every 1.5 years in a multicenter prospective cohort study in Germany. While HRQoL was quantified by using the Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) of the EQ-5D instrument, depressive symptoms was assessed by using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Individuals reported the frequency ('never' to 'every day') of social engagement (e.g., engagement in the church, as a volunteer, in a party, or in a club) in the last four weeks. Fixed effects regressions were used to estimate the effect of social engagement on the outcome variables. Results: After adjusting for age, marital status, functional status and chronic diseases, fixed effects regressions revealed that the onset of social engagement markedly increased HRQoL and considerably decreased depressive symptoms in the total sample and in women, but not men. Conclusions: Our findings corroborate the relevance of social engagement for HRQoL and depressive symptoms in old age. Encouraging the individuals to start, maintain and expand social engagement in late life might help to maintain and improve HRQoL and decrease depressive symptoms.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the relationships between social activities, incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and non-CVD mortality among older adults in the United States. Method: Data from the Health and Retirement Study (2006-2010) were employed. Two measures of social engagement, volunteering and informal helping, along with two measures of social participation, attendance at religious services and social group meetings, were included. Mediation models for health behaviors were estimated. Results: Multinomial logistic regression models demonstrated that volunteering provided the most consistent results in terms of a lower risk of incident CVD and mortality. Furthermore, volunteering at higher time commitments is related to lower CVD incidence and death; informally helping others at a modest time commitment is related to lower risk of death only. Health behaviors mediated the relationships. Social participation was not related to either CVD or mortality. Discussion: Social activity is a modifiable behavior that may be considered a potential health intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Taking a cross-national perspective, we investigate linkages between volunteer work, informal help, and care among Europeans aged 50 or older. Based on 27,297 personal interviews from the 2004 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we estimate univariate and multivariate probit models, which allow us to analyze the interrelationship between those non-market productive activities. There is substantial variation in the participation in volunteering, helping, and caring between countries. Independent of the general level of activity in a country, we find evidence for a complementary and interdependent relationship between all three activities. Our findings not only suggest an important role of societal opportunity structures in elders’ productive engagement, but also support notions of the existence of a general motivation to be active.

AB  - This article aims at providing an overview of patterns, potentials, and limitations of formal volunteering among older Europeans. Based on data from the 2004 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we first describe cross-national variations in formal voluntary engagement and report on recent research investigating societal determinants of volunteering. We then discuss general issues related to policies and programs promoting older people’s voluntary engagement. This is complemented by some critical remarks on the current 'productive aging' debate in Europe. Pointing out limitations of volunteering in the older population, we conclude by suggesting a broad concept of aging, which encompasses both productive and consumptive elements, as an appropriate model for our aging societies.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the dynamics of volunteering in the population aged 50 years or older across 11 Continental European countries. Design and Methods: Using longitudinal data from the first 2 waves of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we run multivariate regressions on a set of binary-dependent variables indicating transitions from active volunteering to inactivity and vice versa. Results: Volunteer transitions were affected by both time-invariant individual resources and changes in individuals’ resources. Moreover, we found that the societal context in which older persons live not only has a significant impact on the prevalence of volunteering at a given point in time but that the dynamics of volunteering also vary by country. Implications: Our study supports the notion of volunteering as an important productive aging activity and underlines the importance of both life-course and social context factors as determinants of volunteer dynamics at older ages.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed a growing interest in longitudinal studies of aging. The perspective of cumulative advantage/adversity was employed to explain health disparities in later life. In terms of methodology, recent advances in the statistical theory of growth curve models have enabled important breakthroughs in the study of correlates of change. Moreover, moving beyond single-trajectory growth curve analysis, a combination of the longitudinal model for individual change and the cross-sectional model for matched pairs makes it possible to estimate dual aging trajectories of marital dyads. Hence, this dissertation focuses on effects from social activities and partner influences that affect aging. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) data, I conduct three studies in this dissertation. In first two studies, I perform growth curve analyses to examine how activities such as volunteering, helping and late-life employment influence aging trajectories for mid-old aged and older adults. In the third study, I extend growth curve models into family and marriage research to estimate dual aging trajectories for marital dyads and to examine cross-partner interactive processes. The results suggest that social activity and marital context do influence aging processes after midlife. Findings also confirm the existence of selection mechanisms that may drive healthy individuals into activity and similar individuals into a marital relationship. In total, causal relations between activities and partner influence and the effects on later aging trajectories are established. Moreover, these studies predict that, to the extent that the changes accumulate, the above mechanisms will keep shaping older adults' health trajectories over time. This suggests a mutually reinforcing cumulative process of selection and causal mechanisms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Linear growth curve modeling was used to compare rates of change in functional status between three groups of older adults: Individuals holding voluntary lay leadership positions in a church, regular church attenders who were not leaders, and those not regularly attending church. Functional status was tracked longitudinally over a 4-year period in a national sample of 1,152 Black and White older adults whose religious backgrounds were either Christian or unaffiliated. Leaders had significantly slower trajectories of increase in both the number of physical impairments and the severity of those impairments. Although regular church attenders who were not leaders had lower mean levels of impairment on both measures, compared with those not regularly attending church, the two groups of non-leaders did not differ from one another in their rates of impairment increase. Leadership roles may contribute to longer maintenance of physical ability in late life, and opportunities for voluntary leadership may help account for some of the health benefits of religious participation.

AB  - Employees today are involved in many different types of activities outside of work, including family, volunteering, leisure, and so on. The purpose of this study was to understand how participation in such nonwork activities can both enrich and interfere with well-being and behavior at work. Four dimensions of nonwork-to-work spillover were examined to better understand this process (i.e., positive emotional, negative emotional, positive behavioral, and negative behavioral). Survey data were collected in 2 waves from 293 staff and faculty members of a large Canadian university (N = 108 matched surveys from both waves). We found that volunteering is associated with increased well-being and work satisfaction, and that it creates positive emotional and behavioral, and negative behavioral spillovers. We also found that sports, recreation, and fitness are associated with improved well-being and positive emotional spillover. Negative spillover is associated with negative outcomes.

AB  - Promoting health and well-being among individuals of advancing age is a significant issue due to increased incidence of cancer among older adults. This study demonstrates the benefits of expecting positive outcomes and participating in volunteer activities among older adults with cancer. We used a nationally representative sample of 2,670 individuals who have experienced cancer from the 2008 wave of the Health and Retirement Study. We constructed a structural equation model to explore the associations of optimism, volunteerism, life satisfaction, and psychological well-being. The level of optimism was a significant predictor of volunteerism, which in turn affected life satisfaction and psychological well-being. The level of engagement in volunteer activities was found to have significant path coefficients toward both life satisfaction and psychological well-being. Our study provides evidence that older adults who have experienced cancer and maintained a positive outlook on their lives and engaged in personally meaningful activities tended to experience psychological well-being and life satisfaction.

AB  - Experience Corps® (EC) is a high-commitment US volunteer program that brings older adults into public elementary schools to improve academic achievement of students. It is viewed as a health promotion program for the older volunteers. We evaluated the effects of the EC program on older adults’ health, using a quasi-experimental design. We included volunteers from 17 EC sites across the US. They were pre-tested before beginning their volunteer work and post-tested after two years of service. We compared changes over time between the EC participants (n = 167) and a matched comparison group of people from the US Health and Retirement Study (2004, 2006). We developed the comparison group by using the nearest available Mahalanobis metric matching within calipers combined with the boosted propensity scores of those participating in the EC. We corrected for clustering effects via survey regression analyses with robust standard errors and calculated adjusted post-test means of health outcomes, controlling for all covariates and the boosted propensity score of EC participants. We found that compared to the comparison group, the EC group reported fewer depressive symptoms and functional limitations after two years of participation in the program, and there was a statistical trend toward the EC group reporting less decline in self-rated health. Results of this study add to the evidence supporting high-intensity volunteering as a social model of health promotion for older adults. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose: This longitudinal study examines the effect of social participation on mortality and cognitive impairment for the elderly in Taiwan. Methods: Data were from an elderly population panel in Taiwan 'The Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly' 1993-1999. Social participation was defined as paid/unpaid job and participating in volunteer and social groups. Logistic regression analysis was used for predicting the influence of social participation to 6-year mortality and cognitive function impairment, by controlling of socioeconomic status and health-related variables. Results: The elderly with continuous paid work were more likely to participate in social groups. Having paid or unpaid work at the baseline year could lower the risk of mortality six years later, especially for men. Having unpaid work was associated with a higher risk of impaired cognitive function compared to that of non-workers. Participating in a religious group reduced the risk of mortality for women and participating in political groups reduced the risk of impaired cognitive function for men. Discussion: Participating in some types of social activities may reduce mortality or cognitive function impairment in the elderly. However, different activities, gender roles and uneven opportunities for work and social group participation may affect the risk of these endpoints.

AB  - Using samples of U.S. residents recruited from an online subject pool, this research confirms that charitable behavior is associated with higher life-satisfaction based on a retrospective survey (Study 1). Adopting experimental manipulation, we also find that participants report higher life-satisfaction after volunteering for a downward comparable target (i.e., the poor) than helping a non-comparable target (i.e., Wikipedia). But the above effect exists only among high social-comparison individuals (Study 2). Moreover, among people high in social comparison, comparing oneself with a downward comparable target without helping can lead to a similar level of life-satisfaction as helping the target. In contrast, participants who are low in social comparison achieve higher life-satisfaction when comparing themselves to rather than helping the target (Study 3). These findings suggest that charitable giving and volunteering contributes to life-satisfaction through allowing for downward social comparison.

AB  - This study examines whether and how volunteering is associated with the well-being of older people in rapidly aging Asian societies; this topic has received remarkably little attention in the literature. Based on the severity of their population aging problem, five Asian societies are selected for an empirical study, namely Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. We conduct analysis of the latest World Values Survey data set collected from 2011 to 2012 and the effect of volunteering on four aspects of well-being, namely self-reported life satisfaction, happiness, health, and life mastery. Given the ordinal nature of well-being, we establish ordered probit models that focus on voluntary work type, volunteer age, and the level of immersion in volunteer work. The findings indicate a significant positive relationship between active volunteering and well-being, which is valid for all well-being aspects. Active volunteering may have a more significant effect on well-being than inactive volunteering. Age is also a relevant factor affecting volunteering effect. No significant volunteering benefits are found for people younger than 54 years old. Voluntary work in charitable, humanitarian, and religious organizations is the most closely associated with higher well-being for relatively younger people. For people aged 65 and above, volunteering in self-help and cultural organizations is also associated with higher well-being. Moreover, immersion in volunteer work is crucial, particularly for retired people and people aged more than 65 in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. The results suggest people should be encouraged to engage in longer hours (or longer duration) of voluntary service. This study identifies the types of volunteer work that most effectively enhance the well-being of older people, which might help older adults transition to retirement and age with higher well-being and help aging societies alleviate their labor shortage problems by involving productive older people.

AB  - This paper provides evidence on time-use from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a large general-purpose survey that is representative of the U.S. population age 51 and over. The data stand out for its rich set of covariates which are used to present variation in time-use by health and socio-economic status. The HRS interviews about 20,000 persons about a wide array of topics, covering economic status, physical and mental health, family relations and support, labor market status and retirement planning. In 2001, a random sub-sample of 5,000 respondents in 5,000 households was sent a supplemental questionnaire, the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey (CAMS), asking respondents about recall information on time-use and spending. It generated 3,866 responses. In 2003, CAMS wave 2 was mailed to the same 5,000 people. The authors combine these data with information on the same respondents from the core HRS survey. Analyses of basic data quality show very low rates of item non-response overall, with slightly higher rates among groups with lower socio-economic status. They combine the information on time-use obtained for 31 activities into the following categories: economic activity, leisure, housework, sleeping and napping, personal care, exercise, managing finances, time at computer, socializing, helping others and volunteering. They compare the CAMS measures with measures from the American Time-Use Study, and find fairly close correspondence. They present descriptive statistics for these time-use categories by personal characteristics, such as age, sex and health status, illustrating the richness of the HRS data.

AB  - Abstract - Background There is growing research and policy interest in the potential for using the natural environment to enhance human health and well‐being. This resource may be underused as a health promotion tool to address the increasing burden of common health problems such as increased chronic diseases and mental health concerns. Outdoor environmental enhancement and conservation activities (EECA) (for instance unpaid litter picking, tree planting or path maintenance) offer opportunities for physical activity alongside greater connectedness with local environments, enhanced social connections within communities and improved self‐esteem through activities that improve the locality which may, in turn, further improve well‐being. Objectives To assess the health and well‐being impacts on adults following participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities. Search methods We contacted or searched the websites of more than 250 EECA organisations to identify grey literature. Resource limitations meant the majority of the websites were from UK, USA, Canada and Australia. We searched the following databases (initially in October 2012, updated October 2014, except CAB Direct, OpenGrey, SPORTDiscus, and TRIP Database), using a search strategy developed with our project advisory groups (predominantly leaders of EECA‐type activities and methodological experts): ASSIA; BIOSIS; British Education Index; British Nursing Index; CAB Abstracts; Campbell Collaboration; Cochrane Public Health Specialized Register; DOPHER; EMBASE; ERIC; Global Health; GreenFILE; HMIC; MEDLINE‐in‐Process; MEDLINE; OpenGrey; PsychINFO; Social Policy and Practice; SPORTDiscus; TRoPHI; Social Services Abstracts; Sociological Abstracts; The Cochrane Library ; TRIP database; and Web of Science. Citation and related article chasing was used. Searches were limited to studies in English published after 1990. Selection criteria Two review authors independently screened studies. Included studies examined the impact of EECA on adult health and well‐being. Eligible interventions needed to include each of the following: intended to improve the outdoor natural or built environment at either a local or wider level; took place in urban or rural locations in any country; involved active participation; and were NOT experienced through paid employment. We included quantitative and qualitative research. Includable quantitative study designs were: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster RCTs, quasi‐RCTs, cluster quasi‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after studies, interrupted‐time‐series, cohort studies (prospective or retrospective), case‐control studies and uncontrolled before‐and‐after studies (uBA). We included qualitative research if it used recognised qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. Data collection and analysis One reviewer extracted data, and another reviewer checked the data. Two review authors independently appraised study quality using the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool (for quantitative studies) or Wallace criteria (for qualitative studies). Heterogeneity of outcome measures and poor reporting of intervention specifics prevented meta‐analysis so we synthesised the results narratively. We synthesised qualitative research findings using thematic analysis. Main results Database searches identified 21,420 records, with 21,304 excluded at title/abstract. Grey literature searches identified 211 records. We screened 327 full‐text articles from which we included 21 studies (reported in 28 publications): two case‐studies (which were not included in the synthesis due to inadequate robustness), one case‐control, one retrospective cohort, five uBA, three mixed‐method (uBA, qualitative), and nine qualitative studies. The 19 studies included in the synthesis detailed the impacts to a total of 3,603 participants: 647 from quantitative intervention studies and 2630 from a retrospective cohort study; and 326 from qualitative studies (one not reporting sample size). Included studies shared the key elements of EECA defined above, but the range of activities varied considerably. Quantitative evaluation methods were heterogeneous. The designs or reporting of quantitative studies, or both, were rated as ‘weak’ quality with high risk of bias due to one or more of the following: inadequate study design, intervention detail, participant selection, outcome reporting and blinding. Participants’ characteristics were poorly reported; eight studies did not report gender or age and none reported socio‐economic status. Three quantitative studies reported that participants were referred through health or social services, or due to mental ill health (five quantitative studies), however participants' engagement routes were often not clear. Whilst the majority of quantitative studies (n = 8) reported no effect on one or more outcomes, positive effects were reported in six quantitative studies relating to short‐term physiological, mental/emotional health, and quality‐of‐life outcomes. Negative effects were reported in two quantitative studies; one study reported higher levels of anxiety amongst participants, another reported increased mental health stress. The design or reporting, or both, of the qualitative studies was rated as good in three studies or poor in nine; mainly due to missing detail about participants, methods and interventions. Included qualitative evidence provided rich data about the experience of participation. Thematic analysis identified eight themes supported by at least one good quality study, regarding participants' positive experiences and related to personal/social identity, physical activity, developing knowledge, spirituality, benefits of place, personal achievement, psychological benefits and social contact. There was one report of negative experiences. Authors' conclusions There is little quantitative evidence of positive or negative health and well‐being benefits from participating in EECA. However, the qualitative research showed high levels of perceived benefit among participants. Quantitative evidence resulted from study designs with high risk of bias, qualitative evidence lacked reporting detail. The majority of included studies were programme evaluations, conducted internally or funded by the provider. The conceptual framework illustrates the range of interlinked mechanisms through which people believe they potentially achieve health and well‐being benefits, such as opportunities for social contact. It also considers potential moderators and mediators of effect. One main finding of the review is the inherent difficulty associated with generating robust evidence of effectiveness for complex interventions. We developed the conceptual framework to illustrate how people believed they benefited. Investigating such mechanisms in a subsequent theory‐led review might be one way of examining evidence of effect for these activities. The conceptual framework needs further refinement through linked reviews and more reliable evidence. Future research should use more robust study designs and report key intervention and participant detail. Plain language summary Participation in environmental enhancement and conservation activities for health and well‐being in adults Background : This is the report from a systematic review examining if taking part in activities that enhance the natural environment (such as maintaining paths to access the countryside) can improve people’s physical and mental health. A systematic review is a research method to identify, quality appraise and synthesise all relevant evidence about a particular topic. It is thought that contact with the natural environment has a positive impact on health and well‐being. For example, those living closer to green spaces have better mental health than those who don’t. Parks and countryside may also provide a place for healthy activities which can improve physical health. There is interest in understanding whether the natural environment can be a resource to improve public health. Methods : We wanted to know if taking part in nature conservation, or other activities that enhance the environment (such as litter‐picking), can impact on health. The activities examined aimed to improve the outdoor environment in urban or rural locations. Participants were adult volunteers or were referred by a healthcare professional. We conducted a systematic review. We searched databases and contacted experts to identify all relevant academic and unpublished research (grey literature) from any country. Results : We found 19 studies based on numerical data (quantitative) and text from interviews (qualitative). They came from the UK, US, Canada and Australia. The majority of quantitative studies reported no effect on health and well‐being. There was limited evidence that participation had positive effects on self‐reported health, quality of life and physical activity levels. Some also reported increased mental fatigue and greater feelings of anxiety. The qualitative studies illustrate the experiences of people taking part, and their perceptions of the benefits. People reported feeling better. They liked the opportunity for increased social contact, especially if they had been socially isolated through, for example, mental ill‐health. They also valued a sense of achievement, being in nature and provision of a daily structure. Limitations : The results need to be treated with caution because the research methods used were not very robust and cannot show definitively that participation caused any health change. The quality of the research, in terms of study design and reporting, was low. Conclusions : Given the quality of the evidence, we cannot draw any definite conclusions. More reliable research is needed to understand exactly how and why these activities may benefit health, and to assess whether they could be used as an effective health promotion tool.

AB  - The ways in which social worker induction into volunteer work sustain the older person's well-being is the focus of this study which surveyed 719 Chinese people aged 60 or above in Hong Kong, China. Results show the significant contribution of social worker induction to the older person's self-esteem, life satisfaction, and self-assessed health. Moreover, social worker induction magnified the benefit of volunteering. On the other hand, social worker induction was less salutary to older people with higher incomes and more illness. Social worker input is therefore most beneficial to people in a condition compatible with the input.

AB  - With the increased life expectancies, changing demographics, India's elderly population is at the highest ever 8.1% of total population, making it imperative for both policy makers and practitioners to be concerned with the wellbeing of the elderly and their successful ageing. An active life, positive interpersonal relationships, positive engagement and continued employment are markers of successful ageing and high psychological well-being. The present study investigates the effect of post retirement work involvement (paid or voluntary) on mental health of retired individuals. The sample consisted of 68 retirees out of which 34 were working and 34 were non-working post retirement and they were assessed using the Mental Health Inventory (MHI; Veit & Ware, 1983) with two global scales of Psychological Well-being (PWB) and Psychological Distress (PD) and a global Mental Health Index (MHI). The effect of post retirement work involvement on subscales of general positive affect, emotional ties, life satisfaction, anxiety, depression and loss of behavioural/emotional control was also measured. Significant differences were seen in the mental health, psychological well-being and psychological distress of the two groups along with the differences in the subscales. These insights can be used for enhancing the mental well-being of the retirees through continued life engagement post retirement.

AB  - Background: We tested the hypothesis that a higher level of social activity was associated with decreased risk of incident disability in older adults. Methods: Data came from older adults in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of aging. Analyses were restricted to persons without clinical dementia and reporting no need for help performing any task in the particular functional domain assessed. Participants were followed for an average of 5.1 years (SD = 2.5), Social activity, based on 6 items (visiting friends or relatives; going to restaurants, sporting events, or playing games; group meetings; church/religious services; day or overnight trips; unpaid community/volunteer work), was assessed at baseline. Disability in basic activities of daily living, mobility disability, and instrumental activities of daily living was assessed annually. Proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, and education were used to examine the association between social activity and incident disability. Fully adjusted models included terms for depression, vascular diseases and risk factors, body mass index, social networks, and self-reported physical activity. Results: In fully adjusted models, among 954 persons without baseline disability, the risk of developing disability in activities of daily living decreased by 43% (hazard ratio = 0.57, 95% confidence interval = 0.46, 0.71) for each additional unit of social activity. Social activity was also associated with decreased risk of developing mobility disability (hazard ratio = 0.69, 95% confidence interval = 0.54, 0.88) and disability in instrumental activities of daily living (hazard ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval = 0.55, 0.93). Conclusions: Social activity is associated with a decreased risk of incident disability in activities of daily living, mobility, and instrumental activities of daily living, among community-dwelling older adults.

AB  - This study aims to examine the effect of the death of a family member or friend on psychological well-being, specifically the moderating effects of first-time volunteering and social network. With the sample of 354 volunteers from the Experience Corps® (EC) programs, Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) estimated the differences in psychological well-being. Among volunteers who had experienced the death of a family member or friend, new volunteers showed significant improvement in positive affect compared to experienced volunteers. EC members gained additional social contacts through volunteering. Formal volunteering has a salutatory effect on older adults' health after the loss of family members.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to identify differences in family functioning and health between older adult volunteers and non-volunteers. Two findings emerged from the data: volunteers reported higher family functioning as well as better health compared to non-volunteers. Implications for social workers involved with volunteer programs and services are discussed in terms of volunteer recruitment and retention, and the related need to develop policies that permit more flexibility and choice with regard to volunteer responsibilities.

AB  - Numerous studies link volunteering to positive mental and physical health for older adults, and recent studies have suggested that volunteering may be particularly beneficial for those who are widowed. This research examines the potential of volunteering to buffer participants from stress-related health declines associated with the death of a spouse. Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this research investigates the moderating role of volunteering on the self-rated health and depressive symptoms of recently widowed older adults. Consecutive waves of the HRS are used to identify respondents who experience the death of a spouse or who remain married, and those married or widowed respondents who participate in volunteer work over a two-year period. Waves 1998 through 2004 are used to construct three observation periods: 1998–2000, 2000–2002, and 2002–2004. A series of logistic and negative binomial regression analyses are used to estimate the direct effect and interactive effect of widowed status and volunteer status on self-rated health and depressive symptoms respectively. Results indicate that while volunteering decreases the odds of being in fair or poor health and decreases the expected number of depressive symptoms for volunteers compared with nonvolunteers, volunteering does not buffer recent widows from declines in self-rated health or reduce the risk of more depressive symptoms. The results do not support the idea that volunteering serves as a source of social support for older adults when dealing with the stress of spousal loss. However, the findings do support the idea that participating in volunteering helps older adults remain socially integrated through a meaningful role in their community.

AB  - The latter port of the 20th century was a period characterized by a fundamental transition in scholarship on activity and the aging process. Theory emphasizing the inevitable decline of human capacity was gradually replaced with concepts stressing positive, multidimensional views of aging. In this article, we highlight the key contributors and trace the origins and overlapping themes of successful aging, productive aging, and civic engagement in later life: 3 examples of scholarship representing a 'positive' gerontology. Rowe and Kahn's model of successful aging highlights the interplay between social engagement with life, health, and functioning for a positive aging experience. Productive aging, led by Robert Butler, recognizes the previously underappreciated participation of older adults in activities such as volunteering, paid work, and caregiving, and generates interest in the individual and societal barriers to and benefits of participation. Civic engagement in later life raises public awareness about the need to involve older adults in the community, creates opportunities for participation, and generates further interest in the mutual benefit of participation for community beneficiaries and participants. Successful aging, productive aging, and civic engagement represent important contributions to the field of gerontology through applications to policy, advocacy, and theory development.

AB  - This article presents and interprets the strong evidence that helping others in meaningful ways generally results in a happier, healthier, resilient, and even longer life for the giver; based on the strength of this evidence overall and in subpopulations including patient groups, it then asserts that the time has come for health-care professionals to prescribe and recommend such behavior at sustainable levels generally in the range of 2 hours per week. The medical evidence justifies the prescribing (or recommending) of volunteerism and helping activities for individuals, schools, companies, and whole communities. This article presents this innovative claim against the backdrop Norman Rockwell’s iconic image of The Golden Rule (1961), in which he captures the benefits of focusing our minds and actions on contributing to the lives of others. The review encompasses all age groups, many special categories of people grappling with illness, and population health generally. S. Johnston provides an opening commentary to this paper.

AB  - Owing to increasing labour market flexibilization, a growing number of people are likely to experience unemployment and, as a consequence, lower mental health and well-being. This article examines cross-national differences in well-being and mental health between unemployed people who engage in voluntary work and those who do not, using multilevel data from the European Quality of Life Survey on unemployed individuals in 29 European countries and other external sources. This article finds that, regardless of their voluntary activity, unemployed people have higher levels of well-being and mental health in countries with more generous unemployment benefits. Unexpectedly, the results also suggest that regular volunteering can actually be detrimental for mental health in countries with less generous unemployment benefits. This article concludes that individual agency exercised through voluntary work can partially improve well-being but the generosity of unemployment benefits is vital for alleviating the negative mental health effects of unemployment.

AB  - This dissertation challenges the overly psychological conception of personal well-being. Using survey data from a random sample of adults, the study begins by demonstrating the reliability and validity of five scales measuring dimensions of social well-being. The study then introduces a contributive model of functioning, in which giving, as well as getting, promotes wellness. Controlling for formative familial experiences and fixed characteristics, analyses demonstrate that recent volunteering and community activism relate to higher levels of well-being. Nonrecursive models suggest that recent social involvement may cause social well-being. Explanatory mechanisms are proposed. In turn, social perception of the communalism (e.g., caring) and agency (e.g.,, assertiveness) of oneself and other people purportedly affect wellness. Adhering to a model of balance, perceiving oneself as more communal and more agentic relate to higher levels of well-being. However, perceiving other people as less agentic, but more communal, correspond with higher levels of well-being. Motivational explanations are invoked to explain how self-and-other perception relates to well-being. The final chapter proposes the concept of role repertoire to explain the relationship of multiple roles and well-being. After Steele (1988), the self is a general system designed to maintain its overall integrity. Multiple roles are tantamount to a repertoire of resources for defending the self. How positive people feel about, and how much they think other people value them in, their roles indicate the quality of the role repertoire as a resource. Roles are parsed into domains of social involvement (e.g., volunteer) and standard (e.g., parent) identities. Well-being increases as the size and positivity of the social involvement domain increase. The size and evaluation of the standard role domain do not consistently predict well-being. In sum, social involvement (behavior), social perception (thinking), and soci (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objectives: Faced with aging societies, there is an immense need to better understand the nature of volunteering outside advanced Western industrial countries. As a case of a rapidly aging society, we identify robust factors associated with elderly volunteering in Korea in terms of a resource framework. Methods: Data were derived from the Social Statistics Survey conducted by the Korea National Statistical Office in 1999 (N = 7,135) and 2003 (N = 8,371). We first determined overall and age-related volunteer rates for Korea compared to the United States. Using logistic regression, we then examined the effects of human, cultural, and social capital variables on volunteering. Results: Approximately 6% of Koreans aged 65 years and older participate in volunteer programs. All human capital variables are positively related with volunteering. For cultural capital, those who identify their religion as Buddhism or Catholicism are more likely to volunteer than those who have no religion. But surprisingly, Protestantism does not consistently promote volunteering across both years. For social capital, older adults who live alone or with a spouse are more likely to volunteer than those living with both a spouse and children. Discussion: In contrast to human capital, cultural and social capital on elderly volunteering appears to be contoured by social contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Social capital has been studied by academics for more than 20 years and within the past decade there has been an explosion of growth in research linking social capital to health. This paper investigates social capital in Hamilton, Ontario by way of a telephone survey of 1,002 households in three neighbourhood groups representing high, mixed, and low socio-economic status (SES). A social capital measurement tool is proposed as a straightforward way to account for differences in social capital perceptions and actions among residents. Consistent with the literature, the paper found that there was a strong association between social capital perceptions and health, particularly mental health and life stress. Social capital was greater in the high and mixed SES neighbourhoods and much weaker in the low SES neighbourhoods. With respect to social capital actions, both volunteering and voting was associated with positive overall health and mental health. Finally, the paper identified the social capital 'elite'--respondents with high or above average perceptions and who participated in the two social capital actions--voting and volunteering. Prominent among the social capital elite in Hamilton is the 'health wealthy' senior, a positive development for the continued social well-being of the city.

AB  - This research examines how the linkages between different types of social networks and subjective wellbeing (SWB) vary across gender and age through structural equation modeling. Data came from a nationwide survey for older adults conducted in 1999 (N= 3,482). SWB was measured by life satisfaction and depressive symptoms. A three-factors model for social networks showed a good fit, consisting of child contact, informal contact with friends and neighbors, and social participation related to groups/volunteer activities. The effects of four types of networks (i.e., spouse and the three factors) on SWB were compared among the 4 gender x age groups. Gender differences were more prominent among the young-old (63-74 years old) than the old-old (75 and over), namely, the effects of being married and social participation on life satisfaction were greater for males than females, whereas informal contact was more important for female life satisfaction and depression. Among the old-old, the association between child contact and SWB was stronger than among the young-old. Further research is needed to ascertain whether the age differences result from aging and/or cohort variations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Assessed whether giving support to others within informal as well as formal settings might also benefit older help-providers. Findings from a recent nationwide survey of 1,551 adults (aged 60+ yrs) suggest that giving informal, but not formal, assistance to others appeared to bolster feelings of personal control in later life. Greater feelings of personal control were in turn related to lower levels of depressive symptomatology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Previous research highlighted the beneficial effects of volunteering, income and employment, and religiousness in older adults, but not the interrelationships between these variables and their effects on quality of life. In the present study, 399 community-dwelling retirement-aged New Zealanders completed the WHOQOL-BREF quality of life questionnaire and questions about their volunteering and employment activities. Path-analysis models tested the direct and indirect effects of these variables on quality of life. While employment was not a significant predictor, volunteering was positively associated with physical, psychological, and environment quality of life, and religious community membership predicted psychological and social quality of life, although effects were small. Volunteering did not mediate the relationship between religious community membership and quality of life. Volunteering and religious community membership thus provide independent QOL benefits, and future work may model their unique effects by including measures of feeling a sense of meaning and purpose as potential mediating variables. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Investigaciones previas han destacado los efectos beneficiosos del voluntariado, los ingresos y el empleo, y la religiosidad en adultos mayores, pero no las interrelaciones entre estas variables y sus efectos sobre la calidad de vida. En el presente estudio, 399 neozelandeses con edad para jubilarse y que viven en comunidad completaron el cuestionario sobre la calidad de vida WHOQOL-BREF y preguntas sobre sus actividades de voluntariado y de empleo. Los modelos de análisis de rutas pusieron a prueba los efectos directos e indirectos de estas variables sobre la calidad de vida. Mientras que el empleo no fue un pronosticador significativo, el voluntariado se asoció positivamente a la calidad de vida física, psicológica y medioambiental, y la pertenencia a una comunidad religiosa pronosticó calidad de vida psicológica y social, aunque los efectos fueron pequeños. El voluntariado no medió en la relación entre la participación en una comunidad religiosa y la calidad de vida. El voluntariado y la participación en una comunidad religiosa proporcionan de este modo beneficios para la calidad de vida, y los futuros estudios pueden mostrar sus efectos exclusivos mediante la inclusión de mediciones de un sentimiento de significado y propósito como variables de mediación potenciales. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Des recherches antérieures ont mis en évidence les effets bénéfiques du bénévolat, des revenus et de l'emploi, et de la religiosité chez les personnes âgées, mais pas les relations entre ces variables ni leurs effets sur la qualité de vie. Dans la présente étude, 399 Néozélandais en âge de prendre la retraite et vivant en milieu communautaire ont réalisé le questionnaire sur la qualité de vie WHOQOL-BREF et répondu aux questions sur leurs activités en termes de bénévolat et d'emploi. Les modèles d'analyse des pistes causales ont testé les effets directs et indirects de ces variables sur la qualité de vie. Alors que l'emploi n'était pas un facteur prédictif significatif, le bénévolat était associé positivement à la qualité de vie physique, psychologique et environnementale, et l'appartenance à une communauté religieuse prédisait la qualité de vie psychologique et sociale, bien que les effets soient faibles. Le bénévolat n'a pas joué un rôle dans la relation entre l'appartenance à une communauté religieuse et la qualité de vie. Le bénévolat et l'appartenance à une communauté religieuse présentent ainsi des avantages de qualité de vie indépendants et les travaux futurs peuvent modéliser leurs effets uniques en intégrant des moyens permettant d'évaluer le sentiment d'avoir un sens et un but dans la vie en tant que variables médiatrices potentielles. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] In früheren Studien wurden die positiven Auswirkungen von ehrenamtlicher Arbeit, Einkommen und Beschäftigung und Religiösität für ältere Menschen hervorgehoben; doch wurde nicht auf die Wechselbeziehungen zwischen diesen Variablen und ihre Auswirkungen auf die Lebensqualität eingegangen. In der vorliegenden Studie füllten 399 in einer Gemeinschaft lebenden Neuseeländer im Rentenalter den WHOQOL-BREF-Fragebogen zur Lebensqualität aus und beantworteten Fragen hinsichtlich ihrer ehrenamtlichen Arbeit und ihrer Beschäftigung. Anhand von Modellen der Pfadanalyse wurden die direkten und indirekten Auswirkungen dieser Variablen auf die Lebensqualität untersucht. Während die Beschäftigung kein bedeutender Prädikator war, wurde die ehrenamtliche Arbeit positiv mit der physischen, psychischen und umweltbezogenen Lebensqualität assoziiert, und die Mitgliedschaft in einer Religionsgemeinschaft prognostizierte eine psychische und soziale Lebensqualität, auch wenn die Auswirkungen gering waren. Eine ehrenamtliche Tätigkeit wirkte sich nicht vermittelnd auf die Beziehung zwischen der Mitgliedschaft in einer Religionsgemeinschaft und der Lebensqualität aus. Ehrenamtliche Tätigkeiten und die Mitgliedschaft in einer Religionsgemeinschaft bringen somit unabhängige Vorteile für die Lebensqualität, und zukünftige Arbeiten können deren einzigartigen Auswirkungen veranschaulichen, indem man die Messung des Gefühls von Bedeutung und Zweck im Leben als potenzielle Mediatorvariablen einschließt.

AB  - Objectives This study examined age-related cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between activity diversity and four dimensions of well-being: psychological well-being, depression, positive affect, and negative affect. Method Activity diversity was defined as the breadth and evenness of participation in seven daily activities including paid work, time with children, doing chores, leisure, physical activities, formal volunteering, and giving informal help to others. Participants from the National Survey of Daily Experiences (N = 793, M age = 46.71, SD ag = 12.48) provided data during two 8-day measurement bursts approximately 10 years apart. Results Older adults (age = 60–74 years) who engaged in more diverse activities reported higher psychological well-being than older adults who engaged in less diverse activities; an association not significant among middle-aged adults (age = 35–59 years), and in the opposite direction for younger individuals (age = 24–34 years). Longitudinally, increased activity diversity over 10 years was marginally associated with increases in positive affect. Compared with younger individuals who increased activity diversity, older adults who increased activity diversity reported smaller decreases in psychological well-being, greater increases in positive affect, and greater decreases in negative affect. Discussion Our findings suggest that activity diversity may play an important role in older adults’ concurrent well-being and also in their long-term longitudinal improvements of well-being.

AB  - Objectives: Volunteering is an important component of social life but may be interrupted by life events. This research investigated how widowhood influences subsequent volunteer participation as well as the potential moderating effect volunteer participation may have in coping with the death of a spouse. Methods: Analysis of three waves (1986-1994) of longitudinal data from the Americans' Changing Lives study tested (a) the effect of widowhood on volunteer participation, (b) the influence of the timing since becoming widowed on volunteering and personal well-being, and (c) the interaction effects of volunteering and widowhood on personal well-being. A cross-sectional time-series design is used to test relationships with people aged 50 years and older at baseline. Results: Compared with their continually married counterparts, people who experienced spousal loss reported greater likelihood of pursuing volunteer roles, not immediately but a few years after the death of their spouse. Volunteer roles adopted after spousal loss protected against depressive symptoms, and increases in volunteer hours enhanced self-efficacy. Discussion: These patterns highlight the compensatory function of volunteer participation that helps to offset the negative impact of widowhood on well-being in later life.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines the relationship between transitions in volunteering activity and physical and psychological health outcomes among older adults in Taiwan. Method: We used 3 waves of a longitudinal survey from Taiwan (1999, 2003, and 2007) including 1,847 older adults aged 58–74. We categorized volunteer activity over time into 5 categories and used generalized estimating equations to examine the relationship between volunteer transition group membership and health outcomes. Results: Approximately, 3% of older volunteers kept volunteering and 7% stopped or started their volunteering over time. Engaging in any volunteering, including continuous volunteering, discrete volunteering, active-to-inactive volunteering, and inactive-to-active volunteering, was significantly associated with better self-rated health and higher life satisfaction when compared with the nonvolunteering group. Only those in the continuous volunteer group and those who shifted from inactive-to-active volunteering showed a positive association with better physical function and less depression, compared with the nonvolunteering group. Discussion: The results suggest that the positive relationship between volunteering and health may decline when older adults discontinue or withdraw from volunteering. More research is needed to explore the mechanism behind older people’s desistance from, persistence in, and resumption of volunteer engagement.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: This study examined whether participating in productive activities was associated with better health outcomes among older adults in urban China, including analysis of potential gender differences. Design and Methods: Using a sample of 10,016 urban Chinese adults aged 60 years or older from the 2006 Sample Survey of the Aged Population in Urban/Rural China, we regressed measures of self-rated health, functional health, and depression on productive activities (paid employment, helping with family, and volunteering), controlling for sociodemographic variables. Results: Those who provided assistance to family members or volunteered had significantly lower levels of depression and better functional and self-rated health than their counterparts. Older adults with paid job, providing family assistance, or volunteering reported significantly lower levels of depression and better functional and self-rated health than those without those activities. However, only older men with paid employment reported significantly less depression, and the effect of family assistance on functional health also differed by gender. Implications: As research increasingly demonstrates the role of productive activities in maintaining health among older adults, our findings can help practitioners or policy makers strategically select or develop health programs to promote productive activities among older adults in urban China.

AB  - In this study, we used mailed questionnaires and focus groups to collect data and investigate how non-profit-making organizations (NPOs) and community organizations (COs) promoting active aging in Taiwan. The main sources of our data were 1,688 local community elderly caring centers, 10 service branches for the Hondao Senior Citizen's Welfare Foundation across Taiwan, and 10 community health centers. We distributed 1,708 questionnaires and recovered 525, for a recovery rate of 30.74 %. The results of this study indicated that the respondents' cognition of the content of active aging was nearly identical in considering the most important sequence to be physical health, mental health, learning new things, engaging in volunteer work, being respected, and community participation. The most popular sequence for active aging activities was elderly leisure, neighborhood friendship, elderly healthcare study programs, elderly talent shows, elderly health promotion, elderly talent inheritance, and lifelong education. The factors preventing elderly people from participating in active aging activities were inconvenient transportation, a lack of related incentives, excessive distance, a lack of companions to accompany them, and activity being unsafe.

AB  - This study aims to identify patterns of productive activity engagement among older adults in urban China. Once patterns are identified, we further explore how a set of individual characteristics is associated with these patterns. Using data from the 2011 baseline survey of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we performed a latent class analysis (LCA) on a national representative sample of adults aged 60 years and over (N = 3019). A specified range of productive activity indicators that fit the context of urban China was used for performing LCA (including working, grandchildren’s care, parental care, spousal care, informal helping, and formal volunteering). A multinomial logistic regression was used to assess whether individual characteristics are associated with the identified patterns. The results indicated that a four-class model fit the data well, with the interpretable set of classes: spouse carer (51.2 %), working grandparents (21.7 %), multifaceted contributor (16.6 %), and light-engaged volunteer (10.5 %). Age, gender, education, number of children, proximity with the nearest child, household composition and functional status contributed to differentiating these classes. This study captured the reality of productive engagement among older adults by drawing attention to how multiple productive activities intersect in later-life stages. Our findings have implications for policy-makers, health care practitioners, and community advocates to develop programs that facilitate this aging population in assuming meaningful productive activities.

AB  - Investing in normative, age-graded social roles has broad implications for both the individual and society. The current meta-analysis examines the way in which personality traits relate to four such investments -- work, family, religion, and volunteerism. The present study uses meta-analytic techniques (K = 94) to identify the cross-sectional patterns of relationships between social investment in these four roles and the personality trait domains of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability. Results show that the extent of investment in social roles across these domains is positively related to agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and low psychoticism. These findings are more robust when individuals are psychologically committed to rather than simply demographically associated with the investment role.

AB  - Background: Many people now want or need to work longer due to increased life expectancy. In some countries statutory retirement ages deny older people free access to the labour market. It has been hypothesised that exclusion from employment may have negative effects on the mental health of older people. The global financial crisis has forced some countries to propose increasing the retirement age but the implications of this for population health are unclear. This paper reviews the evidence for the mental health impacts of working beyond retirement, and discusses the implications for future public health and welfare policy. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted of studies that examined the effect of working or volunteering beyond traditional retirement ages on mental health outcomes. Results: Of the ten studies that met the inclusion criteria, none showed a negative impact of working beyond retirement age on mental health. Four studies showed that post-retirement working has a statistically significant positive effect on a range of mental health outcomes. Discussion: This review suggests that working beyond traditional retirement ages may be beneficial for mental health in some populations. The mechanisms by which this occurs are complex but are likely to be mediated by the maintenance of productive societal roles, continued income and social support. The benefits of post-retirement employment are unlikely to be universal as such factors will have varying effects depending on individual lifestyle, self-esteem and socioeconomic status. Although our research shows that allowing older people free access to the employment market may have important health benefits, flexible retirement strategies are needed to ensure that any national policy to increase statutory retirement age does not increase health and social inequalities in the elderly.

AB  - This study assessed engaged lifestyle activities (e.g., volunteering, traveling, and public speaking) for centenarians of the Georgia Centenarian Study. A total of 285 centenarians and near-centenarians (i.e., 98 years and older) and their proxy informants participated in this study. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was assessed for all centenarians, and proxy informants reported on lifestyle activities and personality traits of the centenarians. Results suggested that participants who had volunteered, traveled, and those who had given public talks and balanced their checkbooks were more likely to show relatively high mental status scores (i.e., MMSE > 17). Personality traits were found to be moderators in the relationship between engaged lifestyle and mental status: Participants with high levels of Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness, and Conscientiousness and with high levels of engaged lifestyle were more likely to show relatively high mental status scores (i.e., MMSE > 17), whereas participants with low levels of Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness and with low levels of engaged lifestyle were more likely to show relatively low mental status scores (i.e., MMSE < 18). The results suggest that engaged lifestyle, particularly in combination with personality traits, plays an important role in the level of cognitive functioning among oldest old adults.

AB  - Purpose: This study tested the effect of multiple levels of engagement in the productive roles of paid work, volunteering, and caregiving on midlife and older adults’ psychological well-being. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from a sample of 330 adults aged 50 and older (largely white, women, and educated), a treatment effects model was employed to test the impact of four levels of engagement (not involved and low, medium, and high engagement) on psychological well-being. Results: Those involved in work or volunteer activities who were high in engagement reported greater psychological well-being than those who were not involved, whereas those who were low or medium in engagement reported lower well-being than those not involved. A different pattern emerged for caregiving; midlevels of engagement were associated with higher well-being compared with the noninvolved, whereas low and high levels of engagement were associated with lower well-being. Implications: Findings suggest that one’s experience of an activity plays an important role in the extent to which involvement is associated with positive outcomes. Recommendations for enhancing role quality to promote psychological well-being in middle and later life are discussed.

AB  - This study draws from the work engagement literature to define engagement as an indicator of role quality and to develop a measure--The Productive Engagement Portfolio (PEP)--that can be used to assess engagement in work, volunteering, caregiving, and informal helping among older adults. A Rasch measurement approach was used to develop both Likert-based and semantic-differential-based measures of engagement across 4 roles. Items for both scales were developed through an iterative process that included focus groups, 4 pilot tests, and one full-scale administration. Results suggest that the psychological state of engagement can be conceptualized and measured on a meaningful continuum defining a unidimensional and hierarchical construct ranging from lower to higher levels of engagement. The technical characteristics of the items were found to be invariant across each productive role type for both measurement approaches and the meaning of person scores within a role were found to be independent of the response format for both approaches. Using score conversion charts designed to translate the scale scores into a form that is readily transparent and usable for practitioners, our scales can easily and meaningfully chart a person's level of engagement pre- and post-intervention. The PEP instrument can also be used in survey research or by practitioners in community or medical settings to assess the extent to which older adults are involved in roles that enhance their overall quality of life.

AB  - The current study tests the indirect effect of activity-related physical activity, cognitive activity, social interaction, and emotional exchange on the relationship between activity involvement and health (physical and emotional) in later life. Longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (N = 5,442) were used to estimate a series of linear regression models. We found significant indirect effects for social interaction and benefit to others (emotional exchange) on emotional health (depressive symptoms) and indirect effects for use of body and benefit to others (physical) on physical health (frailty). The most potent indirect effect associated with emotional and physical health was experienced by those engaged in all four domains (use of body, use of mind, social interaction, and benefit to others). While effect sizes are small and results should be interpreted with caution, findings shed light on ways in which public health interventions aimed toward increasing role engagement in later life could be improved.

AB  - Volunteer-based programs are increasingly designed as interventions to affect the volunteers and the beneficiaries of the volunteers' activities. To achieve the intended impacts for both, programs need to leverage the volunteers' engagement by meeting their expectations, retaining them, and maximizing their perceptions of benefits. Programmatic features that may increase volunteer engagement include supervision, flexibility, assistance, training, recognition, and stipend support. Using longitudinal data from a study of older adult volunteers in Experience Corps (N = 208), the present study tested the facilitative effects of these features on volunteer engagement. Regression results indicated that positive perceptions of supervision and assistance predicted exceeded expectations, whereas supervision, flexibility, and recognition predicted retention and benefits. Stipend receipt also predicted benefits. Results indicated that these facilitation measures are conceptually and empirically similar and have an overall positive impact on volunteer engagement outcomes when treated additively. In the context of the study's implications, findings suggest that volunteer management 'basics' facilitate volunteer engagement among the sample of older adult volunteers, with implications for practice and future research.

AB  - In this paper, we examine whether and what extent public and private forms of religiosity act as moderators of the volunteering and well-being relationship in mid- to later-life. We use data from the second wave of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (n = 1,805). We analyzed the relationships between volunteering and indicators of well-being (self-rated physical and mental health), and tested the moderating effects of public and private religiosity on the volunteering and well-being relationship. Our findings suggest that salubrious effects of volunteering on the self-perceived physical and mental health of middle- aged and older- aged adults varied by their participation in different forms of religiosity. In particular, volunteers who engaged in more public forms of religiosity reported significantly better physical and mental health than non-volunteers who engaged in these forms of religiosity. In other words, individuals who were actively engaged public forms of religious practices and who volunteered, maximized the associated health benefits.

AB  - This paper examines whether participation in social activities is associated with higher levels of wellbeing among post-retirement age people in England, and, if so, whether these relationships are explained by the reciprocal nature of these activities. Cross-sectional analysis of relationships between social activities (including paid work, caring and volunteering) and wellbeing (quality of life, life satisfaction and depression) was conducted among participants of one wave of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) who were of state pension age or older. Participants in paid or voluntary work generally had more favourable wellbeing than those who did not participate in these activities. Caring was not associated with wellbeing, although female carers were less likely to be depressed than non-carers. Carers, volunteers and those in paid work who felt adequately rewarded for their activities had better wellbeing than those who were not participating in those activities, while those who did not feel rewarded did not differ from non-participants. These results point to the need to increase the rewards that older people receive from their productive activities, particularly in relation to caring work.

AB  - Volunteering constitutes one of the most important pro-social activities. Following Aristotle, helping others is the way to higher individual wellbeing. This view contrasts with the selfish utility maximizer, who avoids helping others. The two rival views are studied empirically. We find robust evidence that volunteers are more satisfied with their life than non-volunteers. The issue of causality is studied from the basis of the collapse of East Germany and its infrastructure of volunteering. People who lost their opportunities for volunteering are compared with people who experienced no change in their volunteer status.

AB  - Although a relationship between volunteering and well-being has been demonstrated in numerous studies, well-being has generally been poorly operationalized and often defined by the relative absence of pathology. In this study, the authors take a positive approach to defining well-being and investigate the relationship between volunteering and personal and neighborhood well-being. The theoretical approach incorporates elements of the homeostatic model of well-being. A sample of 1,289 adults across Australia completed a questionnaire that assessed personal and neighborhood well-being, personality factors, and the psychosocial resources implicated in the homeostatic model of well-being. Analyses reveal that volunteers had higher personal and neighborhood well-being than nonvolunteers and that volunteering contributed additional variance in well-being even after psychosocial and personality factors were accounted for. The findings are discussed in terms of previous research and the homeostatic model of well-being, and it is argued that the relationship between volunteering and well-being is robust.

AB  - Explored the potential mediating roles of exercise and participation in nonphysical leisure activities (e.g., attending cultural events, volunteering) in the relation between perceived control and well-being (i.e., health and life satisfaction) among 1,258 elderly people interviewed in 1983 and 1990. An internal locus of control was positively related to exercising and participation in leisure activities. Exercising and leisure activity participation, in turn, were predictive of better perceived health and greater life satisfaction. Findings point to the potential benefits of increasing elderly peoples' sense of control as a means to promote exercise and to increase leisure activity participation and, consequently, to enhance well-being.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines the impact of social capital on depressive symptoms trajectories among Korean women aged 65 years or older. It also examines the difference in depressive symptoms and social capital by economic status (poverty group, non-poverty group) among community-dwelling older women in Korea. Method: This study used 2435 older women of the Korean Welfare Panel Study from 2006 (wave 1) to 2013 (wave 8) data using latent growth modeling. Social capital variables were cognitive (interpersonal trust, reciprocity) and structural (the size of family, the number of friends or neighbors, participation in leisure and volunteer activities). Results: The results showed both intra- and inter-individual variability in depressive symptoms over time. Interpersonal trust and reciprocity as cognitive social capital had an effect on the change of depressive symptoms in intercept and slope. The size of family, participation in leisure activities among structural social capital were associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms in intercept and slope. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest some practical implications for depression intervention and prevention and further research on late-life depression.

AB  - Introduction Increased attention has focused on the importance of time spent by ageing adults in volunteering. The aim of this systematic review was to analyse literature exploring the relationship between time spent volunteering and quality of life for adults over the age of 50 years. Method Electronic searches of nine databases located relevant articles involving adults over the age of 50 in volunteering activities that included psychological, physical and social quality of life domains. The quality of the selected articles was assessed and data extracted using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results Of the 65 articles retrieved, 22 were reviewed and eight included in the final review. Studies included one randomised controlled trial, one cross-sectional and six longitudinal studies. Levels of time spent volunteering by participants within the studies varied considerably. Articles retrieved reported positive quality of life outcomes including increases in life satisfaction, self-esteem and social support and a slowed functional decline. Conclusion Volunteering is identified as an important occupation for adults over the age of 50, although the relationship between time spent volunteering and the impact on quality of life outcomes is still not fully understood. Future research is required to better understand the impact of time spent volunteering on quality of life.

AB  - The impacts of the productive social activities of volunteer and paid work on health have rarely been investigated among the oldest Americans despite a recent claim for their beneficial effect (Rowe and Kahn 1998). This paper used data from Waves 3 and 4 of the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) Study to (1) investigate the impact of these activities on health measured as self-reported health and activities of daily living (ADL) functioning limitations and to (2) explore possible causal mechanisms. Using multinomial logistic regression analysis, amounts of volunteer and paid work over a minimum of 100 annual hours self-reported at Wave 3 were related to poor health and death as competing risks measured at Wave 4, controlling for health measured at Wave 2 and for other predictors of poor health and death. Findings suggest that performing more than 100 annual hours of volunteer work and of paid work have independent and significant protective effects against subsequent poor health and death. Additional analyses suggest that the quantity of volunteer and paid work beyond 100 annual hours is not related to health outcomes and that physical exercise and mental health measured as cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms explain not entirely overlapping parts of the relationship between productive activities and health.

AB  - Few studies have examined the relationship between productive activities and well-being among urban lower-income African American older adults. The purpose of this study was to examine (1) the pattern and prevalence of types and specific kinds of productive activities and (2) the association among sociodemographic data, individual capacity, kinds and levels of productive activity, and well-being at the individual level. Approximately 12% of 531 respondents participated in employment, whereas 20% participated in volunteer activities. The majority of the respondents (99.4%) joined in leisure activities. More than 75% engaged in religious activities. The respondents also reported that they participated in various kinds of productive activities. Age, physical health status, perceived social support, and perceived neighborhood satisfaction were the most important regression predictors of perceived well-being. Higher levels of involvement in religious activities and leisure activities were related to a greater perceived well-being.

AB  - A program evaluation of OASIS, a national non-profit organization which provides educational and volunteer opportunities to people over the age of 55, focused on the benefits of participating in educational and volunteer activities. A total of 289 older adults provided their perspectives on the extent to which participation in these activities benefited them in four domains: socialization (social interaction), generativity (productivity), well-being (life satisfaction), and opportunity (chance for new endeavors). The survey results indicate that, in general, older adults perceive that they benefit from participation in these activities. Participants perceived the most benefit in the domain of opportunity, followed by well-being, and then, at the same level, socialization and generativity. Volunteers reported more benefit overall than class takers. When asked what was most beneficial about participation, most respondents mentioned interacting with new people.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to document the benefits of volunteering perceived by older adults and to explain variation in these self-perceived benefits. Design and Methods: This is a quantitative study of 13 volunteer programs and 401 older adults serving in those programs. Program directors completed telephone interviews, and older volunteers completed mailed surveys. Volunteer-level and program-level data were merged. Results: Older volunteers reported a wide variety of benefits to the people they served, themselves, their families, and communities. More than 30% reported that they were 'a great deal better off' because of volunteering, and almost 60% identified a benefit to their families. When considering only individual characteristics, lower-income and lower-educated volunteers reported more benefit. Yet, aspects of the volunteer experience, like amount of involvement, adequacy of training and ongoing support, and stipends, were more important in understanding who benefits from volunteering. Implications: These findings suggest that characteristics of volunteer programs can be strengthened to maximize the benefits of volunteering to older adults. These characteristics are more mutable by public policies and organizational procedures than individual characteristics. Focusing on the recruitment of lower socioeconomic status older adults may result in an increase in benefits from the growth of volunteering.

AB  - Objectives.: This review summarizes the current knowledge about volunteering in later life and suggests 5 research questions at the forefront of knowledge development. Results. Rates of volunteering do not decline significantly until the middle of the 7th decade, and older volunteers commit more hours than younger volunteers. Older adults with more human and social capital tend to volunteer, and there is good evidence of a reciprocal relationship between volunteering and well-being. Program and policy developments in the field are outstripping production of knowledge to support evidence-based practices. Discussion. Research on the dynamics of volunteering over the life course as well as the patterns of activities that co-occur with volunteering is needed to guide program development. Research methods and findings from transdisciplinary work on the mechanisms through which psychosocial conditions affect health must be extended to the study of the effects of volunteering on older adults. Finally, we need to engage in more applied social science aimed at improving volunteer management, especially recruitment and retention of older volunteers.

AB  - The present cross-sectional survey was aimed to investigate the association between social participation and self-rated health and characteristics of randomly selected 1,124 respondents of both the sexes (Male=494 and femal=631) of age varying from 60 years and above, from Western city of Pune, (India). A semi-structured interview schedule to collect data was used in this study. The schedule was comprised of socio-demographic information, self reported health and reporting of chronic diseases, physical activities, social participation and social support system. Interviews were taken at the residence of the respondents. Cross-tables with chi-square tests and Fisher exact test with odds ratio were calculated. Association between various demographic variables and social participation was checked using Chi-square test. It was found that the social interaction with relatives, participation in recreational activities, religious activities and voluntary work was associated with male, married, literate individuals and among those who reported no chronic illness., They undertook regular physical activity and reported self rated 'good ' health status. Chances of increased interaction with relatives, participation in recreational activities, and volunteering/other activities were more among those respondents who reported 'good' health status. The present findings emphasized the importance of maintaining social participation, even with declining functional status, as it may have health protective benefits.

AB  - Objective: Studies have suggested that frequent participation in social groups contributes to the well-being of older people. The primary aim of this study was to identify the number of days older adults should participate in the activities of social groups to maintain their health for 4 years. This study also aimed to examine whether the effective frequency differs by the type of social group activity. Method: We examined a prospective cohort of 1,320 community-dwelling older adults over 65 years of age, who responded to both a baseline and a follow-up mail survey, in a suburban city of Tokyo, Japan. The dependent variable was the change in functional competence during 4 years. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of participation in the activities of the 5 most common social groups among older Japanese on maintaining functional competence. Results: Nine hundred and ninety-four participants (76.5%) maintained their functional competence for 4 years. The results of the logistic regression analyses showed that participating in alumni groups less than once a month and being an inactive member were associated with higher odds of maintaining functional competence, after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic and baseline health status. Additionally, the odds of maintaining functional competence for 4 years increased upon participating in volunteer groups once a month or more. These results were also confirmed using logistic regression analysis, even after adjustment for the effects of participation in other social groups. Discussion: The results indicated the effectiveness of volunteer activities that fulfill a social role in maintaining health. Therefore, older adults should be encouraged to participate in activities of volunteer groups at least once a month. Additionally, older adults can obtain positive health outcomes through less frequent participation in alumni groups, compared with the activities of volunteer groups.

AB  - There is a strong tradition in Britain of volunteering involving a wide range of activities and organisations. Increasingly volunteering is seen as a way of benefiting health and building sustainable communities. In a study in 2007 we aimed to address the research questions: what are the motivations for, barriers to, and benefits of formal practical environmental volunteering for those individuals involved? Qualitative and quantitative data collection was undertaken while spending a day each with ten volunteer groups as they undertook their practical conservation activities. In this paper we focus primarily on the physical, mental and social well-being benefits that volunteers derived from their activities. Our research involved 88 people volunteering regularly in a range of places from scenic natural landscapes to urban green spaces in northern England and southern Scotland. Respondents described a range of benefits they gained from their involvement including improved fitness, keeping alert, meeting others and reducing stress levels. We suggest that practical environmental volunteering has flexibility in the types of activity available and the time scale in which activities are undertaken and therefore can provide a range of physical, social and mental well-being benefits to people with very differing abilities and from different socio-economic backgrounds. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] En Gran Bretaña existe una arraigada tradición de voluntariado que implica numerosas actividades y organizaciones. Cada vez más el voluntariado se considera una actividad beneficiosa para la salud y para crear comunidades sostenibles. En un estudio de 2007 buscábamos respuestas a las siguientes preguntas: ¿Qué motivaciones, barreras y ventajas plantea el voluntariado oficial de medio ambiente para las personas participantes? Recopilamos datos cualitativos y cuantitativos mientras pasamos un día cada uno con diez grupos de voluntariado que realizaban actividades prácticas de conservación. En este trabajo nos centramos sobre todo en las ventajas y el bienestar físico, mental y social que los voluntarios obtenían de sus actividades. Nuestro estudio incluía a 88 personas que, periódicamente, trabajan como voluntarios en distintos lugares, desde espectaculares parajes naturales a espacios verdes urbanos del norte de Inglaterra y el sur de Escocia. Los encuestados describían las ventajas que obtenían de su participación: mejor forma física, el mantenimiento de la atención, conocer gente y eliminar el estrés. Lo que sugerimos es que el voluntariado medioambiental ofrece gran flexibilidad por los tipos de actividades disponibles y la escala en la que se realizan las actividades y que, por tanto, puede proporcionar una serie de ventajas físicas, sociales y mentales a personas con distintas capacitaciones y extractos socioeconómicos. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] la Grande-Bretagne bénéficie d’une forte tradition du bénévolat impliquant un large éventail d’activités et d’organisations. Le bénévolat est de plus en plus considéré comme un moyen de profiter à la santé et de créer des communautés durables. Dans une étude de 2007, nous avons cherché à répondre aux questions de recherche: quelles sont les motivations, les obstacles et les bénéfices de la pratique formelle du bénévolat environnemental pour les personnes concernées? Une collecte de données qualitatives et quantitatives a été effectuée au cours d’une journée passée avec dix groupes de bénévoles tandis qu’ils menaient leurs activités concrètes de conservation. Dans cette étude, nous mettons principalement en évidence les bienfaits du bien-être sur le plan physique, mental et social que les bénévoles retirent de leurs activités. Notre recherche a concerné 88 bénévoles réguliers dans différents lieux, allant des paysages naturels pittoresques aux espaces verts urbains, situés dans le nord de l’Angleterre et le sud de l’Écosse. Les personnes interrogées ont décrit divers bienfaits qu’elles retiraient de leur participation, notamment une meilleure condition physique, le maintien de la vigilance, les rencontres avec les autres personnes et la réduction des niveaux de stress. Nous avançons que la pratique du bénévolat environnemental permet une certaine flexibilité dans les types d’activités proposées et dans les délais pour réaliser les activités, et qu’elle peut donc apporter divers bienfaits en termes de bien-être sur le plan physique, mental et social pour des personnes aux compétences très différentes, issues de milieux socio-économiques variées.

Gemeinnützige Tätigkeiten werden zunehmend als ein Mittel zur Förderung der Gesundheit und zur Errichtung nachhaltiger Gemeinden betrachtet. In einer in 2007 durchgeführten Studie behandelten wir die folgenden Forschungsfragen: Was motiviert die Personen zur Ausführung formeller, praktischer, ehrenamtlicher Tätigkeiten im Umweltbereich und welche Hindernisse und Vorteile bringen diese Tätigkeiten mit sich? Wir begleiteten zehn Gruppen ehrenamtlich Tätiger jeweils einen Tag lang bei ihren praktischen Umweltschutztätigkeiten und sammelten dabei qualitative und quantitative Daten. In diesem Beitrag konzentrieren wir uns vornehmlich auf die Vorteile für das physische, psychische und gesellschaftliche Wohlbefinden der ehrenamtlich Tätigen aufgrund ihrer Arbeit. Unsere Studie umfasste 88 Personen, die regelmäßig an verschiedenen Orten - von schönen natürlichen Landschaften bis hin zu städtischen Grünflächen - in Nordengland und Südschottland ehrenamtliche Tätigkeiten ausübten. Die Befragten beschrieben eine Reihe von Vorteilen, die ihnen ihr Engagement brachte, zum Beispiel verbesserte Fitness, erhöhte Aufmerksamkeit, das Kennenlernen neuer Leute und die Minderung von Stress. Wir zeigen, dass praktische gemeinnützige Tätigkeiten im Umweltbereich in Bezug auf die möglichen Aktivitäten und die Zeitplanung flexibel sind und daher Personen, die über sehr unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten verfügen und aus unterschiedlichen sozioökonomischen Verhältnissen kommen, eine Reihe von physischen, psychischen und gesellschaftlichen Vorteilen bieten können.

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the factors associated with life expectancy at the age of 65 years used as the index of longevity, using published data in Japan. Life expectancy at the age of 65 years was obtained from the 19th life table in 2000 published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. The associations between life expectancy at the age of 65 years and environmental factors were assessed by Spearman correlation coefficients. Life expectancy at the age of 65 years was higher in females (22.54 years) than in males (17.42 years). In this study, the number of public health nurses and leisure time per day were found significantly associated with life expectancy at the age of 65 years in both men and women. For men, life expectancy at the age of 65 years was significantly associated with leisure time for sports and exercises and higher proportion of participation in volunteer activities in the community; for women, it was associated with a higher number of hospitals and proportion of participation in educational classes for the aged. Our ecological study might provide some clues to more practical planning for longevity in consideration of gender differences.

AB  - Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that functional limitations increase, and organizational volunteering decreases, the risk of mortality in later life. However, scant attention has been paid to investigating the joint effect of functional limitations and organizational volunteering on mortality. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that volunteering moderates the relation between functional limitations and risk of mortality. This prospective study used baseline survey data from a representative sample of 916 non-institutionalized adults 65 years old and older who lived in the continental United States. Data on mortality were extracted six years later from the National Death Index. Survival analyses revealed that functional limitations were associated with an increased risk of dying only among participants who never or almost never volunteered, suggesting that volunteering buffers the association between functional limitations and mortality. We conclude that although it may be more difficult for older adults with functional limitations to volunteer, they may receive important benefits from doing so.

AB  - Previous studies have established a positive association between organizational volunteering and well-being. In the current study, we examined whether the relations between organizational volunteering and positive affect, negative affect, and resilience are modified by respondents' age and number of chronic health conditions. This study used cross-sectional data from the 2008 Arizona Health Survey of residents 18 years old and older (N = 4,161). Multiple regression analyses provided no support for the hypothesis that age moderates the association between volunteer status and positive affect, negative affect, and resilience. In contrast, there was a significant (p < .05) interaction between volunteer status and chronic health conditions on positive affect and resilience. Consistent with the compensatory hypothesis, as number of chronic health conditions increased, the relations between volunteering and positive affect and resilience scores increased. Implications of these findings for increasing volunteering among adults with multiple chronic health conditions are discussed.

AB  - Organizational volunteering has been touted as an effective strategy for older adults to help themselves while helping others. Extending previous reviews, we carried out a meta-analysis of the relation between organizational volunteering by late-middle-aged and older adults (minimum age = 55 years old) and risk of mortality. We focused on unadjusted effect sizes (i.e., bivariate relations), adjusted effect sizes (i.e., controlling for other variables such as health), and interaction effect sizes (e.g., the joint effect of volunteering and religiosity). For unadjusted effect sizes, on average, volunteering reduced mortality risk by 47%, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 38% to 55%. For adjusted effect sizes, on average, volunteering reduced mortality risk by 24%, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 16% to 31%. For interaction effect sizes, we found preliminary support that as public religiosity increases, the inverse relation between volunteering and mortality risk becomes stronger. The discussion identifies several unresolved issues and directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aim This study aimed to examine the relationship of participating in community activities (CA) with cognitive impairment and depressive mood independent of mobility disorder (MD) among older Japanese people. Methods Elderly residents in institutions or those requiring long-term care insurance services were excluded; questionnaires were mailed to 5401 older adults in 2013. The response rate was 94.3% (n = 5094). We used multiple imputation to manage missing data. The questionnaire addressed physical fitness, memory, mood, and CA. Participants were divided into two groups (good and bad) based on the median scores for physical fitness, memory, and mood. We identified items related to periodically performed CA, cognitive impairment, and depressive mood, and examined correlations between scores on these sets of items. Results The mean age was 75.9 years; 58.4% of participants were women. The following CA significantly predicted reduced cognitive impairment and depressive mood independent of MD: volunteer activity, community activity, visiting friends at home, pursuing hobbies, paid work, farm work, and daily shopping. These results were corrected for age, sex, and response method (mail or home-visit). Higher CA scores were associated with lower cognitive impairment and lower depressive mood independent of MD. Conclusions CA is negatively associated with cognitive impairment and depressive mood among community-dwelling elderly independent of MD; promoting CA may protect against cognitive impairment and depressive mood in this population. However, MD, cognitive impairment, and depressive mood may lead to reduced CA.

AB  - Drawing on the literature on the extensive investment older adults make in volunteering, and on the findings of a study of 19 not-for-profit agencies that rely heavily on older adults to provide a variety of community services, this paper identifies several significant changes in the character of the clients who are served by these volunteers and in government health policies affecting the delivery of community services. The paper concludes with suggestions for research and policy development aimed to optimize the contribution which older volunteers make to society and reciprocally, the contribution that volunteering makes to the health and well-being of older adults.

AB  - Helping and community service occur in a variety of contexts and across a range of activities, including donations of money and goods and participation in one-day events (such as walkathons or charity auctions). Volunteerism, in particular, is a special form of helping consisting of ongoing commitments to service. This form of helping typically involves people choosing to help others in need, often in organizational contexts (e.g., volunteer service organizations), and the acts of helping are ones that have been actively sought out. What's more, these acts of charity and assistance are often sustained over extended periods of time and can involve considerable expenditures of effort and finances by the volunteer. And, because volunteers typically help people with whom they have no prior contact or association, it is a form of helping that occurs without any bonds of obligation or commitment to the recipients of the volunteer services (e.g., Omoto & Snyder, 1995; Snyder, Clary, & Stukas, 2000; Wilson, 2000). Every year, millions of people engage in volunteer activities of this nature. The U.S. Department of Labor (2004) reported that 64.5 million people, or 29% of the U.S. population, volunteered during 2004 alone. Although their rate of volunteering is less than non-elder adults, older adults, specifically those over age 65, volunteer at relatively high levels; approximately 25% are currently active volunteers (U.S. Department of Labor, 2004). Furthermore, those older adults who do volunteer tend to give the most time, with estimates ranging up to 2.5 times the commitments of volunteers aged 25 to 34 (Brown, 2000; U.S. Department of Labor, 2004). With projections indicating that older adults will make up an increasingly larger percentage of the population and that adults will live longer into postretirement, there are calls to encourage productive aging and continuing civic engagement through volunteering (e.g., American Psychological Society, 1993). Without doubt, there are many important theoretical and practical reasons to scientifically explore acts of volunteering among this population.

AB  - An evaluation of the Residents as Volunteers project, which aimed to support older people aged over-75 years living in a residential home setting to volunteer and to measure the impact of volunteering on well-being and quality of life. The project was delivered in partnership by Abbeyfield Society and NCVO, and funded by the Big Lottery fund. A total of 110 residents volunteered during the project. Those participating felt that volunteering had a positive impact on their emotional and social well-being and many also reported that volunteering helped them to stay physically and mentally active. The evaluation identified a number of barriers to volunteering faced by care home residents. These included feeling too old, having a health condition, lack of confidence, narrow views of volunteering or anti-volunteering sentiment. The project also found it was far more difficult to reach residents that had never volunteered before. It also identified barriers for staff and care homes themselves, including existing social interactions, staff to resident ratio, existing volunteering culture and non-supportive environment or lack of management buy-in. The report makes some suggestions to overcome these barriers.

AB  - The topic of later life social engagement is of growing importance worldwide given the confluence of large demographic, economic, and sociocultural trends. However, empirical research in this area faces some serious theoretical and methodological limitations. The purpose of this study was to address these limitations by: (1) examining the later life mental and physical health effects of five social roles, namely paid work, formal volunteering, informal helping, caregiving, and religious participation; (2) assessing the health impact of combining various social roles among older adults; and (3) evaluating whether the health effects of social engagement differ for older adults of varying race and SES groups. These questions were examined using data from two waves (1986 and 1989) of the Americans' Changing Lives Study (ACL); this nationally representative data, subset to adults aged 50 and over (N = 1,614), are among the best available for research on later life social engagement. Ordinary Least Square Regression is employed to estimate multivariate linear regression models that assess relationships among aspects of social engagement, social structure, and mental and physical health. Bivariate analyses reveal race and SES variations in social engagement. In particular, while White and upper SES older adults have higher rates of participation in paid work, formal volunteering, and caregiving, a significantly greater proportion of Black and lower SES elders are engaged in activities that are less formal, including informal helping and religious participation. Multivariate analyses indicate that certain roles and role clusters are especially health-enhancing. Specifically, three roles, including paid work, formal volunteering, and informal helping, result in improvements in mental health. Neither caregiving nor religious participation is found to affect changes in mental health in this sample of older adults. In terms of physical health, all roles except caregiving are significantly predictive of improvements in functional health. In addition to single roles, multiple role performance is found to positively impact both mental and physical health in later life. Findings related to role combinations revealed that being involved in volunteer work, informal helping, and religious activities enhances mental health among those who are caregivers. Results also indicated that the impact of being an informal helper is greater for those involved in religious activities than their peers who are not religious participants. Two role combinations emerged as statistically significant predictors of physical health. In particular, both volunteering and informal helping enhanced the physical health benefits of paid work in later life. In other words, while working for pay results in improved physical health, the benefits attached to this role are greater for those who also are involved in helping activities, such as formal volunteering and informal helping. Analyses related to SES reveal that lower SES older adults benefit more from occupying several social roles compared to their upper SES counterparts. In particular, while the mental health benefits of working for pay, formal volunteering, and informal helping are greater for older adults with lower educational attainment, the physical health gains of paid work, volunteering, and informal helping are greater for the elderly with low levels of income and assets. Unlike SES, however, overall findings revealed that White and Black older adults are more similar than different in terms of the health benefits they derive from being socially engaged. There are only two instances, where race differentials emerge. First, I find older Blacks but not Whites to benefit from paid work; and second, results revealed older African caregivers to report greater functional impairment than their White peers. The present study on social engagement in later life has impo… (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Experience Corps® places teams of trained volunteers in elementary school classrooms to promote academic achievement in children and serves as a health-promotion intervention for older adults. Prior to randomization, individuals reported participation in several activities of varying cognitive, physical, and social demands. Maintaining an active lifestyle, particularly in intellectually demanding activities, was associated with physical, mental, and cognitive health in adulthood. Establishing how individuals allocated their time before randomization to this program provides insight into prevalent health behaviors for at-risk older adults, and can provide the basis for examining intervention-related changes in lifestyle as a result of volunteer participation.

AB  - Social participation has been hypothesised to have both positive and negative impact on health outcomes via a variety of pathways, but previous studies have found few significant effects of social participation, and there is a lack of research from post-communist societies, which are known to be low on social capital. Using cross-sectional data from Poland on 2,970 individuals surveyed in 2009, we investigated the individual-level relationships between formal and informal social participation, emotional well-being, and risky alcohol consumption while controlling for demographic variables, socioeconomic status, employment and partnership status, health, religiosity, and generalised trust. Frequent joint activities with friends and neighbours were related to higher positive affect but also to more risky alcohol consumption. Membership in voluntary organisations was associated with more risky alcohol consumption, especially among younger males and for certain types of organisations. In contrast, volunteer work was related to higher positive affect and fewer depressive symptoms in the whole sample and to less risky alcohol consumption among the younger participants. The findings illustrate that some types of social participation, even if they are not typical of a given context (e.g., volunteering in Poland), may be more beneficial than others.

AB  - Several recent studies have shown the mental health benefits of volunteering for volunteers; further, some of these have noted even greater benefits among older adults. Few studies, however, address why volunteering is beneficial for mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine how perceptions of volunteering efficacy affect the mental health of volunteers. Specifically, two perspectives are tested: (1) self-rewarding, which emphasizes the benefits of the activity to the volunteer; and (2) others-rewarding, which emphasizes the benefits of the activity to those being helped. Using data from the first two waves of the American Changing Lives data set, the study shows that volunteers who endorse the others-rewarding perspective have better mental health outcomes than other volunteers; in contrast, those who support the self-rewarding perspective see no benefits for depression. With different age groups, the findings also indicate that the effect of others-rewarding perspective is strongest in young volunteer groups. Considering interaction terms, volunteer hours is negatively related to depression for old volunteers, but positively associated with mid-aged volunteers for both perspectives. Religious volunteering, however, is not related to depression except for mid-aged volunteers.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the extent to which associations between volunteering and subjective well-being (SWB) could be related to volunteers having more supportive social networks relative to nonvolunteers. Method: The sample consisted of 561 midlife and older adults (aged 55–94 years) from the TRAnsitions In Later Life study. Multiple mediation analyses examined associations between hours spent volunteering per week; availability of social support from friends, relatives, and neighbors; positive and negative social exchanges; and SWB. Results: The results indicated that the higher life satisfaction and positive affect reported by those who volunteer at moderate levels (up to 7 hr per week) are related to their higher levels of positive social exchanges and greater availability of social support from friends and family, relative to nonvolunteers. Those who volunteer at higher levels (7 hr or more per week) also reported greater levels of positive affect in comparison to nonvolunteers, and this was related to their greater availability of social support from friends. Availability of support from friends accounted for the greatest proportion of the volunteering–SWB associations. Discussion: The findings suggest that the positive SWB associated with volunteering is related to volunteers’ more extensive friend and family networks.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that engaging in volunteer work may result in longer life and better health. Two studies published this year found that participating in volunteer work was associated with lower rates of death over the next five to seven years, suggesting that volunteer work may have casual benefits upon health (Oman, Thoresen and McMahon, 1999; Musick, Herzog and House, 1999). If these findings are generalizable and are found to be casual, there are important implications for health promotion and disease prevention efforts at both individual and community levels. The practice of volunteering would be confirmed as a valid form of self-care to be encouraged by health professionals. The two recent studies mentioned above found that volunteering had an independent salutary effect on mortality after adjusting for potential confounding variables. One study also found salutary cross-sectional relationships between volunteering and health behaviors, and both studies found statistical interactions (effect modification) between volunteering and other psychosocial variables. No prospective studies have yet examined associations between volunteering and incident morbidity, however. The long- term objectives of this study are to deepen understanding of volunteering and health by testing the generalizability of recent studies liking volunteering with mortality, as well as to lay groundwork for future studies that will seek to elucidate underlying casual pathways. We will examine the generalizability of previous studies and the relationship between volunteering and morbidity in three large epidemiologic cohorts. Using data from the Alameda County Study (with 23 years of follow-up), the Normative Aging Study (with 24 years of follow-up), and the Sonoma Study (5 years of follow-up), we will address the following specific aims: 1. Determine the whether previous findings that volunteering is independently prospectively associated with protection from mortality can be generalized to other cohorts of older and middle-aged adults. 2. Determine the extent to which previous findings of salutary cross-sectional associations between volunteering and health behaviors are generalizable to other cohorts. 3. Examine whether higher levels of volunteering are associated with greater protective effects against mortality than are lower levels of volunteering (i.e., what is the nature of dose-response relationships). 4. Determine which interactions in predicting mortality between volunteering and other variables, especially various types of social or cognitive support (social connections, religious involvement) are generalizable. 5. Examine the prospective association of volunteering with major types of morbidity (hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory diseases) in a variety of cohorts of older and middle-aged adults.

AB  - This article reviews recent international literature on the opportunities and restrictions experienced by older people to act as volunteers in civil society organizations. Our aim was to develop a conceptual framework applicable to the European ageing society. This aim was pursued through a computerized database search focused on studies analyzing the individual, organizational, and/or societal levels. Findings show that senior volunteers are characterized by 'younger' age, good health, and a high level of both educational and socioeconomical status. Volunteers are involved mainly in religious organizations as well as in social and personal care, while main barriers are represented especially by ageist practices. The review shows that the debate on this topic has been barely developed in Europe, both from an individual and societal point of view. Therefore, European countries might take advantage from experiences made in other contexts, but the identification of how this can occur requires further and more specific cross-national research.

AB  - Religious reframing is applying religious beliefs to an assessment of stressful personal situations. If public religious activities (e.g., religious volunteering) meet the necessary criteria to enable religious reframing, they may serve to limit (or “buffer”) the negative impact of stressors (e.g., family conflict) on mental well-being. Based on this dynamic, two out of three public religious activities (i.e., religious volunteering and religious group activities, but not religious service attendance) were predicted to buffer stress based on their capacity to enable religious reframing. Predictions were supported by hierarchical linear regressions using data for Americans aged 40 and older (N = 2579). This research proposes a framework for using religious reframing as the basis for making predictions about relative stress-buffering performances. It also finds that religious service attendance - the most common form of public religious involvement - does not enable religious reframing to the point of effectuating stress buffering.

AB  - In this chapter, the authors describe an innovative, community-based model intentionally designed to promote health and wellbeing among older adults by offering them the opportunity to participate in meaningful and impactful roles as school volunteers to improve the academic performance and behavior of young children. Known as the AARP Experience Corps® program, this program utilizes the time, experience, and wisdom of older adults to improve the academic and behavioral outcomes of kindergarten through third-grade children in public elementary schools. Designed by public health scientists and experts in early childhood education, this program was created to be a high impact model of win-wins for children, older adults, and society through social empowerment of older adults. Preliminary studies from a pilot trial of the Experience Corps program in Baltimore, Maryland showed evidence of sustained increases in physical activity and the potential for preservation of cognitive function among the older adult volunteers, as well as improved standardized reading achievement scores arid reduced number of disciplinary referrals for the children.

AB  - Postretirement patterns of work—employment for pay, voluntary activities, or no work-like activities—were examined for 1,511 recent retirees from major corporations. A related typology of retirement style—reorganizer, rocking chair, holding on, and dissatisfied patterns—was also used. These patterns are examined in terms of preretirement characteristics of the respondents, postretirement attitudes about retirement, and retirement satisfaction. Multivariate analyses comparing the salience of retirement style with health, income, occupation, and preretirement feelings about retiring for predicting retirement satisfaction indicated that retirement style was a significant predictor of overall retirement satisfaction and of the subscales of satisfaction with activities and finances. Implications for preretirement counseling and retirement policies are discussed. (6 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to outline learning and good practice across Europe on the deployment of asset based approaches for promoting active ageing and intergenerational solidarity. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on a wide ranging review of good practice across Europe distilled from desktop analysis and two European roundtable sessions with key stakeholders. Findings – The paper analyses the current level of volunteering by older people across Europe and the evidence for its benefits to the health and wellbeing of older people. It then goes on to provide analysis and good practice regarding area and individual based asset approaches, as well those relevant to addressing the social exclusion faced by people with dementia. Practical implications – The analysis and good practice examples in the report provide resources for developing effective asset based approaches to promoting active ageing and intergenerational solidarity. Originality/value – The review of European experience is particularly original. There has been little if any European review of asset based approaches to active ageing and intergenerational solidarity. Learning from practice elsewhere enables more confident initiatives to be taken up and developed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Volunteering has been linked to reduced mortality in older adults, but the mechanisms explaining this effect remain unclear. This study investigated whether volunteering is associated with increased survival in participants of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and whether differences in survival are modified by functional disabilities. METHODS: A multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model was used to estimate the association of volunteering with survival over a period of 10.9 years in 10 324 participants, while controlling for selected confounders. To investigate effect modification by disability, the analyses were repeated in participants with and without self-reported functional disabilities. RESULTS: Volunteering was associated with a reduced probability of death from all causes in univariate analyses (HR=0.65, CI 0.58 to 0.73, p<0.0001), but adjustment for covariates rendered this association non-significant (HR=0.90, CI 0.79 to 1.01, p=0.07). Able-bodied volunteers had significantly increased survival compared with able-bodied non-volunteers (HR=0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.95, p=0.009). There was no significant survival advantage among disabled volunteers, compared with disabled non-volunteers (HR=1.06, CI 0.88 to 1.29, p=0.53). CONCLUSIONS: Volunteering is associated with reduced mortality in older adults in England, but this effect appears to be limited to volunteers who report no disabilities.

AB  - Background: The world's population is ageing, and four of the top 10 most rapidly ageing developing nations are from the region of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Although an ageing population heralds likely increases in chronic disease, disability-related dependence, and economic burden, the societal contribution of the chronically ill or those with disability is not often measured. Methods: We calculated country-specific prevalences of 'disability' (difficulty with at least one activity of daily living), 'disease' and 'co-morbidity' (presence of at least one, and at least two, of seven chronic diseases/conditions, respectively), and 'active community engagement' (using five levels of community participation, from less than weekly community contact to voluntary or paid work) in seven LAC cities. We estimated remaining life expectancy (LE) with and without disability, disease and comorbidity, and investigated age, sex, and regional variations in disability-free LE. Finally, we modeled the association of disease, co-morbidity and disability with active community participation using an ordinal regression model, adjusted for depression. Results: Overall, 77% of the LAC elderly had at least one chronic disease/condition, 44% had co-morbidity and 19% had a disability. The proportion of disability-free LE declined between the youngest (60-64 years) and the eldest (90 years and over) age-groups for both men (from 85% to 55%) and women (from 75% to 45%). Disease-free and co-morbidity-free LE, however, remained at approximately 30% and 62%, respectively, for men (20% and 48% for women), until 80-84 years of age, then increased. Only Bridgetown's participants had statistically significantly longer disability-free LE than the regional average (IRR = 1.08; 95%CI 1.05-1.10; p < 0.001). Only Santiago's participants had disability-free LE which was shorter than the regional average (IRR = 0.94; 95%CI 0.92-0.97; p < 0.001). There was 75% active community participation overall, with more women than men involved in active help (49% vs 32%, respectively) and more men involved in voluntary/paid work (46% vs 25%, respectively). There was either no, or borderline significance in the association between having one or more diseases/conditions and active community engagement for both sexes. These associations were limited by depression (odds ratio [OR] reduced by 15-17% for men, and by 8-11% for women), and only remained statistically significant in men. However, disability remained statistically significantly associated with less community engagement after adjusting for depression (OR = 0.58, 95%CI 0.49-0.69, p < 0.001 for women and OR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.47-0.65, p < 0.001 for men). Conclusion: There is an increasing burden of disease and disability with older age across the LAC region. As these nations cope with resulting social and economic demands, governments and civic societies must continue to develop and maintain opportunities for community participation by this increasingly frail, but actively engaged group.

AB  - Voluntary association membership has been empirically associated with increased levels of expressed life satisfaction. Some sport researchers have concluded that the positive effect on socioemotional well-being is greater if the voluntary association involves sports. These earlier studies have been constrained by small sample size, narrow age range, or a lack of geographic representativeness. The present study used 2 cross-sectional samples of the American adult population (a total of 3,020 survey respondents) to test the relationship of type of voluntary association (sport vs nonsport) and avowed happiness. Results contradict earlier findings. Membership in a sport (vs nonsport) voluntary association did not lead to substantively higher levels of life satisfaction. For women, the relationship between membership in a sport voluntary association and avowed happiness was negative.

AB  - As America ages, policy-makers' preoccupations with the future costs of Medicare and Social Security grow. But neglected by this focus are critically important and broader societal issues such as inter - generational relations within society and the family, rising inequality and lack of opportunity, productivity in late life (work or volunteering), and human capital development (lifelong education and skills training). Equally important, there is almost no acknowledgment of the substantial benefits and potential of an aging society. The MacArthur Foundation Research Network on an Aging Society offers policy options to address these issues and enhance the transition to a cohesive, productive, secure, and equitable aging society. Such a society will not only function effectively at the societal level but will provide a context that facilitates the capacity of individuals to age successfully. This volume comprises a set of papers, many of which are authored by members of the MacArthur Network, focusing on various aspects of the opportunities and challenges facing the United States while it passes through its current demographic transformation. This essay provides a general overview of the strategy the Network has used to address the various components of this broad subject. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Proponents of productive aging claim that occupying productive roles is beneficial to the self and others. The authors use the role enhancement and role strain perspectives to examine the impact of multiple productive roles on the well-being of older caregivers. Using three waves of the America Changing Lives Study, the authors controlled for invariant and time-variant factors to test the effects of occupying multiple productive roles on the three well-being indicators of 270 older caregivers. Older caregivers who worked and/or volunteered reported better self-rated health, supporting the role enhancement hypothesis. No evidence of role strain was found. For caregivers without multiple productive roles, high informal social integration was related with low functional impairment. This study suggests that productive roles may have a positive effect on older caregivers and finds no evidence of any negative effects. The implications of these findings in policy, research, and program development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates the relationships between specific types of leisure activities and well-being variables (i.e. health perception, life satisfaction and optimism) in older adults. A convenience sample of 188 participants ranging in age from 60 to 90 years (<italic>M</italic> = 74.99, SD = 5.49) was recruited from three different senior centres in Korea. Three hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between specific types of leisure activities (outdoor, physical, hobbies and indoor, cultural, home-centred and social and volunteering) and outcome variables. After controlling for covariates, it was revealed that home-centred and social activities were associated with all outcome variables. Volunteer activities were positively related to health perception and life satisfaction. Positive relationships were also observed between life satisfaction and physical activities, optimism and cultural activities and health perception and outdoor activities. These findings suggest that promoting positive social interaction in recreational settings and encouraging participation in volunteer activities are important factors contributing to successful ageing.

AB  - This paper carries out an exploratory investigation into the effect of various types of social interaction on health in Italy. After controlling for household income, education, work status and a number of socio-demographic variables, we find that the frequency of meetings with friends is significantly and positively associated with self-perceived health. The frequency of visits with relatives has a significant, but weaker effect. Membership in voluntary organizations is a significant and weakly negative predictor of good health. Other relevant explanatory variables are education and work status.

AB  - To improve function and quality of life in patients with chronic pain, a prevalent and costly condition, an understanding of the relationships among well-being, physical activity, depression, and life purpose with pain is needed. Because of the role loss experienced by people with chronic pain, activities such as volunteering could have an important role in improving health and well-being. In one study, chronic pain patients who participated in volunteer activities reported both decreased pain and "a sense of purpose." The aim of this study is to test the relationships among pain and well-being, physical activity, depression, and life purpose and then to determine if volunteering activities mediated or moderated these relationships. This observational study was conducted in a large university setting in Kentucky and used a sample of 200 women older than age 50. We found that people with higher pain were more depressed and had lower life purpose and well-being. People who volunteered less had more pain, lower perceived life purpose, more depressive symptoms, and decreased physical activity. Volunteer activities did have a significant mediating effect on the relationship between pain and depression; approximately 9% of the relationship between pain and depression can be accounted for by volunteering. Moderation by volunteering was found between pain and life purpose. We identified important relationships among pain, volunteering, and health outcomes and found that volunteering has a role in improving depressive symptoms and life purpose in women with pain.

AB  - This study concerns understanding death anxiety of retired elderly who are currently doing voluntary work. The sample was made up by 60 subjects, retired and over 65 years of age, 30 of which are doing voluntary work. The instruments used include the Death Anxiety Scale (DAS) and a questionnaire to collect social-demografic (created to this study) data with a second part which evaluated volunteers motivations to that work. When comparing results obtained in the sub-samples, the hypotheses are confirmed. Therefore, the elderly volunteers revealed less death anxiety than those who are not volunteers. These differences revealed to be statistically significant. Considering the results, it is possible to recognize the importance of voluntary work for the reframing of roles and developmental tasks during a period of life such as retirement. Even more, it attains its importance in the individual's existence by their capacity to minimize the existential anguish of death. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Este estudo incide sobre a compreensão da ansiedade perante a morte, em idosos aposentados a realizar trabalho de voluntariado. A amostra foi constituída por 60 sujeitos, com mais de 65 anos e já reformados, 30 dos quais a realizarem trabalho voluntário. Dos instrumentos utilizados fazem parte a Escala de Ansiedade Perante a Morte (DAS) e um questionário para a recolha de dados sociodemográficos* (construído por nós para este estudo, no sentido de conhecer os dados sociodemográficos da amostra). Na comparação dos resultados obtidos nas sub-amostras corroboraram-se as hipóteses levantadas, com significância estatística: os voluntários demonstraram menor nível de ansiedade perante a morte do que os não voluntários. Atendendo aos resultados depreenda-se daí a importância do trabalho voluntário para o reenquadramento de papéis e tarefas desenvolvimentais numa fase da vida como a aposentação. Além disso, alcança-se a sua importância na existência do indivíduo capaz de naturalizar a angústia existencial da morte.

AB  - The baby boomer generation has begun to reach retirement age. What this highly-educated and racially-diverse cohort does in its retirement years has implications for the boomers, their communities, and society. Formal volunteering has been suggested as a mechanism for engaging older adults, as it has been associated with physical and emotional health benefits. However, older adults from underrepresented groups are not as likely to engage in formal volunteer activities and may miss out on these benefits. A review of the literature identifies seven best practices for engaging older adults, including those from minority groups, in formal volunteer activities. These include: personal invitation, role flexibility, stipends, social interaction, support from staff, meaningfulness, and recognition. Using the framework of the Strengths Perspective, identifying and utilizing the strengths of individuals and communities and volunteer goal setting are suggested as additional best practices that may be particularly relevant in attracting a diverse set of older adult volunteers.

AB  - Purpose: This descriptive study aims to determine the relationship between life satisfaction and levels of social functioning in elderly. Method: The sample of the study is consisted of 115 individuals who lives in a district of Aydın between January-March 2012 and who are volunteer to participate the study. The data were obtained from Sociodemographic Data Collection Form, Social Functioning Scale (SFS) and the Life Satisfaction Scale (LSS). Chi-quare, Correlation, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in data analyzes. Findings: 57.4% of the participants were women, 58.3% of elderly participants were married and 93% used auxiliary device. The mean LS total score of men were higher than women (X=10.1 ±3.7). There was a statistically significant relationship between total score of Life Satisfaction Scale and the subscales of Social Functioning. A statistically significant difference were found between age and interpersonal functioning, independence-competence, independence-performance subscales of SFS (X2=11.584, p=0.003, X2=14.988, p=0.001 and X2=20.190, p=0.00 respectively). Unlike the male, life satisfaction scores were increased in females if leisure time activities were increased (z=3.445, p=0.001). There was a positive correlation between interpersonal functionality and life satisfaction score (r=0.188, p=0.045) in elderly. Interpersonal functioning and business-professional scores were lower in the individulas who were using the auxiliary devices (respectively X2=12.405, p=0.03 and X2=25.674, p=0.00). The individuals who live alone were more socially withdrawn than the others (X2=41 289, p =0.00). Results: Life satisfaction and social functioning in elderly were affected from each other in high levels.

AB  - Social productivity - including paid work, volunteer work, care of family members, and informal help to friends - has been linked to health and well-being in older populations. This paper argues that social productivity is a form of inter-personal exchange founded on the notion of reciprocity. As the activities are socially valued, efforts are expended in return for rewards. When efforts are not matched by rewards, an imbalance exists that has the capability to damage the individual's health and well-being. Strong internal motivations for engaging in activities, including the need for self-agency and for self-esteem, may help explain why people stay involved in activities characterized by imbalance and are seen as pathways that may mediate the relationship with health. Different societal structures that act as barriers to social productivity are explored in light of reciprocity and the possibility for imbalance. Last, the potential link between reciprocity in social productivity and the social gradient in older people's health is highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research uses a time-based approach of the causal relationship (Granger-like)between health and social capital for older people in Europe. We use panel data from waves 1 and 2 of SHARE (the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe)for the analysis. Additional wave 3 data on retrospective life histories (SHARELIFE)are used to model the initial conditions in the model. For each of the first 2 waves, a dummy variable for involvement in social activities (voluntary associations, church, social clubs, etc.) is used as a proxy for social capital as involvement in Putnamesque associations; and seven health dichotomous variables are retained, covering a wide range of physical and mental health measures. A bivariate recursive Probit model is used to simultaneously investigate (i) the influence of baseline social capital on current health--controlling for baseline health and other current covariates, and (ii)the impact of baseline health on current participation in social activities--controlling for baseline social capital and other current covariates. As expected, we account for a reversed causal effect: individual social capital has a causal beneficial impact on health and vice versa. However, the effect of health on social capital appears to be significantly higher than the social capital effect on health. These results indicate that the sub-population reaching 50 years old in good health has a higher propensity to take part in social activities and to benefit from it (social support, etc.). Conversely, the other part of the population in poor health at 50, may see its health worsening faster because of the missing beneficial effect of social capital. Social capital may therefore be a potential vector of health inequalities.

AB  - This paper conceptualizes voluntarism as a critical process at the intersection of changes underway in rural communities, and in health and social care systems. Three aspects of the evolving role of the voluntary sector are identified and set within a descriptive model of rural change. Initially, voluntarism is cast as a 'barometer of change' in health and social services, and in rural communities, then considered as a 'mechanism of adjustment' and, ultimately, as an emerging 'space of resistance' to these same changes. The nature and significance of each of the three dimensions of voluntarism is illustrated using results from suites of case studies of ageing in Ontario and the Waikato. The efficacy of the descriptive model and its tripartite view of voluntarism is discussed in light of the under-theorized and under-researched rural dimensions of ageing, voluntarism, and health and social care.

AB  - This study is intended to throw light on the part played by volunteering in the transition by examining closely the experiences of volunteers and the organisations that involve them. The main focus of the study has been on ‘what works’ in relation to the involvement of older people as volunteers, and an important element was to uncover the factors that work against involvement and the steps organisations have successfully taken to overcome these barriers.

AB  - The expectation for older people to volunteer has increased, and married Americans are more likely to volunteer. Drawing on life course and couple decision-making theories, this research examines mid- and later life American couples' volunteer patterns. Ninety-five (95) couples are analyzed to determine characteristics of three groups of couples—both volunteer, neither volunteer, or only one spouse volunteers. Multinomial logistic regression comparing all couples simultaneously finds significant differences. Couples with no volunteers are more likely to report lower joint marital satisfaction and at least one spouse out of the labor force than couples where one spouse volunteers. Couples who have both spouses volunteer are more likely to have a husband with a traditional gender role ideology than those where only one spouse volunteers. Caregiving has no impact on couple volunteering. This paper addresses implications for volunteer recruitment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to determine whether volunteerism is prospectively associated with hypertension risk among older adults. Participants provided data during the 2006 and 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel survey using a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling older adults (age > 50 years). Volunteerism and blood pressure were measured at baseline and again 4 years later. Analyses excluded individuals hypertensive at baseline and controlled for age, race, sex, education, baseline systolic/diastolic blood pressure, and major chronic illnesses. Those who had volunteered at least 200 hr in the 12 months prior to baseline were less likely to develop hypertension (OR = 0.60; 95% CI [0.40, 0.90]) than nonvolunteers. There was no association between volunteerism and hypertension risk at lower levels of volunteer participation. Volunteering at least 200 hr was also associated with greater increases in psychological well-being (B = 0.99, β = .05, p = .006) and physical activity (B = 0.21, β = .05, p = .04) compared with nonvolunteers; however, these factors did not explain the association of volunteerism with hypertension risk.

AB  - The author proposes a conceptual model to explain the diverse roles of social capital—resources embedded in social networks—in the social production of health. Using a unique national U.S. sample, the author estimated a path analysis model to examine the direct and indirect effects of social capital on psychological distress and its intervening effects on the relationships between other structural antecedents and psychological distress. The results show that social capital is inversely associated with psychological distress, and part of that effect is indirect through subjective social status. Social capital also acts as an intervening mechanism to link seven social factors (age, gender, race-ethnicity, education, occupational prestige, annual family income, and voluntary participation) with psychological distress. This study develops the theory of social capital as network resources and demonstrates the complex functions of social capital as a distinct social determinant of health.

This quantitative study analyzed 401 older adults serving in 13 volunteer programs across the United States. Individual volunteer-level characteristics (sociodemographics and volunteer experience) and program-level characteristics (flexibility, recognition, incentives, and so on) were collected. Program directors provided information about program characteristics via telephone interviews, and older volunteers in those programs completed mailed surveys. Variation in perceived benefits was associated with both individual- and program-level factors. Of six dimensions of institutional capacity, role flexibility and recognition had significant associations with higher levels of benefits reported by the volunteers. Mso, incentives in the form of monetary compensation, like for gasoline or meals, offered by programs increased the benefits from volunteering. These findings suggest that characteristics of programs can maximize the benefits that older adults gain from volunteering. Therefore, public policies and program development that increase the institutional capacity of volunteer programs are warranted.

AB  - The Subjective Well-Being status has gained a growing research attention in social sciences during the last decades. The attention given by the academic world to this issue has been followed by the community in general. This line of research is still undeveloped in Portugal, and therefore needs further investigation. The purpose of this study is to analyze the determinants of Life Satisfaction and Happiness, two dimensions of Subjective Well-Being of the Portuguese citizens using micro-data from the European Quality of Life Survey. Ordinary Least Squares regressions and Ordinal Logistic models are estimated to identify the main factors that explain well-being in Portugal. We find that trust in public institutions, satisfaction with material conditions, volunteering activities and employment status have a positive and significant effect on Life Satisfaction. Our evidence also shows that satisfaction with family, satisfaction with material conditions, participation in sport activities, optimism and the marital status are relevant factors in explaining citizen's Happiness in Portugal. The results are similar using Ordinary Least Squares or Maximum Likelihood estimation techniques on ordinal logistic models.

AB  - Much of the literature on aging, retirement, and stages of life has focused on men. The changing role from productive members of society to that of being retired can be either viewed as an opportunity to experience new adventures or depressing for those who are unable to move successfully into the next developmental stage of life. This study examined factors that could contribute to life satisfaction in 144 individuals who were over 65 years of age. The factors that were included in this examination are self-esteem, morale, depression, and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, income, self-reported health status, self-reported mobility status, activity level, work status, and memberships in organizations). Retired individuals were recruited from a number of locations, including senior citizen centers and assisted living centers. The participants completed six instruments, the Life Satisfaction Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Life Attitudes Profile - Revised, Geriatric Morale Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, and a short demographic survey. Most of the participants were female, Caucasian, and either married or widowed. They self-reported their health and mobility as either good or fair. The majority were working as volunteers, actively pursued hobbies, and belonged to church, senior citizen, or civic groups. They interacted with family and friends frequently. The results of the study provided evidence that male and female participants did not differ in their responses regarding life satisfaction, self-esteem, geriatric morale, and geriatric depression. The findings of the present study found that life satisfaction was increased if retired individuals were not depressed, had retired at an early age, were either currently or had been married, had achieved a college education, were active as a volunteer, were in excellent health, and did not work part-time. Understanding which psychosocial variables contribute to life satisfaction can assist professionals working with this group develop programs and strategies to help improve the quality of their life after retirement. Further research is needed to explore the correlates of life satisfaction in the elderly as this group continues to increase its presence in society.

AB  - Traditionally, the United States is considered a nation of volunteers. Volunteerism is deeply rooted in the country's cultural and political institutions, and institutionalized volunteering is a distinguished feature. Federal policies and initiatives have played a significant role in creating and supporting senior volunteering programs. Older Americans engage in structured volunteer work through organizations, are involved in a wide array of volunteer activities, and demonstrate that they are capable and effective in various roles. Volunteer organizations are positioned to engage older adults from various socioeconomic backgrounds and to facilitate volunteer role performance. Through the provisions of access, information, incentives, and facilitation, organizations can promote volunteer engagement. As the baby boomer generation ages, there will be a large pool of potential older adult volunteers among the American population. Given the potential resources embedded in the increasingly large older population, much can be done to expand volunteering by older adults. Volunteering holds great promise for productive engagement among older Americans.

AB  - Using two waves of panel data from 2,681 Americans' Changing Lives, the authors examined the relationships between volunteer work in the community and 6 aspects of personal well-being: happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, sense of control over life, physical health, and depression. Prior research has more often examined the effects of volunteer membership than of volunteer work. Focusing only on the consequences of volunteer work overlooks the antecedents of human agency. People with greater personality resources and better physical and mental health should be more likely to seek community service. Hence, the article examines both selection and social causation effects. Results show that volunteer work indeed enhances all 6 aspects of well-being and, conversely, people who have greater well-being invest more hours in volunteer service. Given this, further understanding of self- versus social-selection processes seems an important next step. Do positive, healthy people actively seek out volunteer opportunities, or do organizations actively recruit individuals of these types (or both)? Explaining how positive consequences flow from volunteer service may offer a useful counterpoint to stress theory, which has focused primarily on negative life experiences and their sequelae.

AB  - Investigated the psychological benefits of 18 commonly chosen leisure activities based on responses from 1,449 persons (aged 65+ yrs) who completed a paragraphs-about-leisure questionnaire that measures the psychological benefits of participation in leisure activities. Interviews also were conducted with 200 participants in senior centers. Data were cluster analyzed using a hierarchical grouping procedure, and a conceptual framework was developed for understanding the psychological benefits derived from participation in leisure activities by persons in the 55–75 age range. Activity clusters were identified as follows: companionship (playing cards, going bowling), compensation (picnicking), temporary disengagement (watching sports, watching TV), comfortable solitude (raising house plants, collecting antiques, reading), expressive solitude (knitting, woodworking), and expressive service (volunteering for service activities, attending social organization meetings). Data support the conclusions that leisure activities may be grouped into meaningful families or clusters on the basis of their psychological benefits.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Although several longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between social participation and incident functional disability, the related mechanisms have remained unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms linking social participation to incident functional disability.<bold>Methods: </bold>We analyzed follow-up data for 11,992 older adults (≥65 years) participating in a community-based, prospective cohort study covering a 9-year period. At the baseline, the subjects were asked about three types of participation in community activities (volunteering, hobbies, and neighborhood associations) and the frequency of their participation. Data on incident functional disability were retrieved from the public Long-term Care Insurance database. The Cox model was used to estimate the multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios of incident functional disability. We then conducted mediation analysis to assess the magnitude of the mediating effect.<bold>Results: </bold>Among 84,760 person-years of follow-up, there were 3,984 cases of incident functional disability. The hazard ratio was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.86) for participating in one type of activity, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74-0.90) for two types of activity and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64-0.77) for three types of activity in comparison with no participation in any activity. Among the estimated mediating effects, cognitive activity accounted for 9.3%, time spent walking for 8.3%, psychological state for 4.6%, and social support for 2.8% of the reduced risk of incident functional disability.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The results of this population-based cohort study indicate that cognitive activity and time spent walking are important mechanisms linking social participation to incident functional disability.

AB  - Objectives To investigate whether social participation ( SP) in older adults is associated with ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living ( IADLs). Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Two local municipalities of Nara, Japan. Participants Individuals aged 65 to 96 (n = 2,774 male, n = 3,586 female) free of IADL disability at baseline. Measurements SP and IADLs were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. SP was categorized into five types and assessed using the number and type of social activities. IADLs were evaluated using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Logistic regression analysis stratified according to sex was used to examine change in IADLs according to SP, with nonparticipation as a reference. Results During the 3-year follow-up, 13.6% of men and 9.0% of women reported IADL decline. After adjusting for age, family structure, body mass index, pension, occupation, medical treatment, self-rated health, drinking, smoking, depression, cognitive function, and activities of daily living, participation in various social activities was inversely associated with change in IADLs in women but not men. Participation in the following types of social activities had significant inverse associations with IADL disability: hobby clubs (odds ratio ( OR) = 0.68, 95% confidence interval ( CI) = 0.49-0.94) for men and local events ( OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.48-0.95), hobby clubs ( OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79), senior citizen clubs ( OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.56-0.97), and volunteer groups ( OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.32-0.99) for women. Conclusion Participation in a variety of different types of social activities was associated with change in IADLs over the 3 years of this study in women, and participation in hobby clubs was associated with change in IADLs in men and women. Recommending that community-dwelling elderly adults participate in social activities appropriate for their sex may promote successful aging.

AB  - Background: Although social participation (SP) is valid in active aging, it is vague which types and the frequency of SP are effective in maintaining instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). We conducted a community-based prospective cohort study and investigated the association of the types and frequency for SP with IADL decline in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: The target population were all individuals aged ≥65 living in a commuter town in Nara, Japan. A total of 6,013 participants with independent IADL at baseline were analyzed. IADL was assessed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence. Six SP types were assessed: volunteer groups, sports groups, hobby clubs, senior citizens’ clubs, neighborhood community associations, and cultural clubs. The frequency of SP was categorized into frequent (i.e., weekly or more), moderate (i.e., monthly or yearly), and non-participation. Using multiple logistic regression models, the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI) for IADL decline were calculated. Covariates included age, marital status, education, subjective economic status, work status, body mass index, chronic medical conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease), lifestyle factors (i.e., alcohol, smoking, and exercise), self-rated health, depression, and cognitive functioning. To examine gender differences, stratified analyses by gender were performed. Results: During the 33-month follow-up, 16.4% of men and 8.7% of women exhibited IADL decline. After adjustment for all covariates, compared to those who never participated, women with moderate participation had significantly lower odds of IADL decline in volunteer groups (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.31–0.88), hobby clubs (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.38–0.79), neighborhood community associations (OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.42–0.81), and cultural clubs (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.31–0.82), and women with frequent participation had lower odds of IADL decline in hobby clubs (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.43–0.93). In contrast, among men, the significant association between SP and less risk of IADL decline was limited to moderate participation in neighborhood community associations (OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.63–0.99), and there were no differences between frequent participation and non-participation in all types of SP. Regarding volunteer groups, compared to women with frequent participation, women with moderate participation had a significantly lower risk of IADL decline (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18–0.77). The results of additional stratified analyses by self-rated health, depression, and cognitive functioning showed that the associations of the type and frequency of SP with IADL decline varied according to physical and mental functioning. Conclusions: Several types of SP have a favorable effect on IADL through moderate participation rather than frequent participation, and women with moderate participation in volunteer groups have a more beneficial effect on IADL than women with frequent participation. When advising community-dwelling older adults on SP for IADL maintenance, health professionals may need to take into account plateau effects, gender differences, and physical and mental functioning.

AB  - Studied whether volunteering improves the psychological and physical well-being of elderly persons and whether elderly volunteers experience different benefits than younger adults. Using nationally representative panel data, the author assessed the long-term impact of volunteering on the life satisfaction and perceived health of persons aged 60 yrs and over, and then compared ordinary least squares regression results for seniors with those for younger adults (aged 25–59 yrs). Older volunteers experienced greater increases in life satisfaction over time as a result of their volunteer hours than did younger adult volunteers, especially at high rates of volunteering. In addition, older adults experienced greater positive changes in their perceived health than did younger adult volunteers. The type of volunteer work in which older and younger adults engage may be part of the reason for these differential effects. But the context in which older and younger adults volunteer and the meaning of their voluntarism are more likely explanations. It is suggested that researchers should take into account volunteer commitment when studying volunteering's effect on well-being, not simply volunteer role.

AB  - Purpose: Experience Corps (EC) represents a high-intensity, intergenerational civic engagement activity where older adults serve as mentors and tutors in elementary schools. Although high-intensity volunteer opportunities are designed to enhance the health and well being of older adult volunteers, little is known about the negative and positive aspects of volunteering unique to intergenerational programs from the volunteer's perspective. Design and Methods: Stressors and rewards associated with volunteering in EC were explored in 8 focus group discussions with 46 volunteers from EC Baltimore. Transcripts were coded for frequently expressed themes. Results: Participants reported stressors and rewards within 5 key domains: intergenerational (children's problem behavior, working with and helping children, observing/facilitating improvement or transformation in a child, and developing a special connection with a child); external to EC (poor parenting and children's social stressors); interpersonal (challenges in working with teachers and bonding/making social connections); personal (enjoyment, self-enhancement/achievement, and being/feeling more active); and structural (satisfaction with the structural elements of the EC program). Implications: Volunteers experienced unique intergenerational stressors related to children's problem behavior and societal factors external to the EC program. Overall, intergenerational, interpersonal, and personal rewards from volunteering, as well as program structure may have balanced the stress associated with volunteering. A better understanding of stressors and rewards from high-intensity volunteer programs may enhance our understanding of how intergenerational civic engagement volunteering affects well being in later life and may inform project modifications to maximize such benefits for future volunteers and those they serve.

AB  - Introduction: Older adults with a high number of chronic conditions and who live in environments that do not promote physical activity have great difficulty initiating and adhering to exercise programs. Novel lifestyle activity interventions that can effectively increase physical activity may address disparities in health in these populations. This study evaluates the effects of the Baltimore Experience Corps program, a community-based volunteer program, on walking activity in older adults. Methods: The Baltimore Experience Corps Trial is a sex-stratified RCT that recruited participants from 2006 to 2009. Older adult participants aged ≥60 years (n = 123) were from a nested objective physical activity trial within the larger Baltimore Experience Corps Trial. Participants randomized to the intervention group were placed as volunteers within the Baltimore public school system for 2 years. The primary study outcome was objectively measured total amount of walking activity measured in steps/day. Differences between intervention and control groups were measured at 12 and 24 months using linear mixed effects models. Data were analyzed in 2014. Results: At 24 months, women, but not men, in the intervention group showed an increased amount of walking activity, averaging 1,500.3 (95% CI = 77.6, 2,922.9) greater steps/day compared with the control group. Women in the control group showed a decline of 1,191.6 (95% CI = –2243.7, –139.5) steps/day at 24 months compared to baseline. Conclusions: A community-based volunteer intervention increased walking activity among older women, who were at elevated risk for both inactivity and adverse health outcomes.

AB  - The paper analyzes the determinants of subjective well-being using data on the Cooperative Sociali Italiane Survey 2007. Aim of the work is to verify whether the genuine relationships among people and participation in activities with high social content may be qualified as essential components of happiness. Confirming the theoretical hypothesis, the empirical analysis shows that between the voluntary activity, to which is linked the production and the consumption of relational goods, and the level of subjective well-being there is a positive association.

AB  - A secondary analysis of a national sample of American adults is used to examine the correlation between membership in voluntary associations and life satisfaction. It is hypothesized that the influence of membership on overall life satisfaction is indirect: Membership influences organizational satisfaction; in turn, organizational satisfaction influences satisfaction with life as a whole. The findings suggest that the hypothesized pattern of relationships is not ubiquitously present for all four of the older age categories studied. Such differences suggest the critical importance of utilizing age-appropriate rather than generic indicators when studying these issues.

AB  - The article discusses the impact of volunteering on mental depression. Volunteering is defined as any voluntary activity in which time and efforts are given to benefit another person, group, or organizations with no financial compensation expected. Several studies have found that volunteer work decreased depressive symptoms in people, and many have found that effects of volunteer work on depression vary by age. Rewards or benefits from volunteering are one of critical impetuses for why people contribute time and efforts to unpaid work.

AB  - The Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) assessed the health and social functioning of a representative sample of 7527 American community-dwelling older people (>70 years). We tested the hypothesis that frequent volunteering is associated with less mortality risk when the effects of socio-demographics, medical status, physical activity and social integration are controlled. We used Cox proportional hazards analyses to assess the unadjusted and adjusted associations between frequency of volunteering and time-to-death (96-month follow-up). Death occurred in 38.3 percent of the sample. After adjusting for covariates, frequent volunteers had significantly reduced mortality compared to non-volunteers. This association was greatest for those who frequently visited with friends or attended religious services.

AB  - <span class="AbstractHeading">Abstract </span>There is compelling evidence supporting the benefits of increased regular physical activity in older adults. The Experience Corps program in Baltimore MD was designed in part as a community based approach to increasing physical activity that would also appeal to older adults who have historically not utilized health promotion programs. The Baltimore Experience Corps program places older volunteers in public elementary schools for 15 h a week in roles designed to improve the academic outcomes of children and, simultaneously, increase the physical, cognitive and social activity of volunteers. This paper reports on the change in physical activity levels among older adults associated with participation in the Baltimore Experience Corps. In a pilot randomized controlled evaluation, older adults were randomly assigned to Experience Corps (EC participants) or a waiting list control group. Ages ranged from 59–86 years, 96% were African American, 94% were women, and 84% had annual incomes less than $15,000. EC participants were required to serve ≥15 h a week. At follow-up after 4–8 months, an analysis of 113 randomized volunteers revealed 53% of the EC participants were more active than the previous year by self-report, as compared to 23% of the controls (p<0.01). When adjusted for age, gender and education, there was a trend toward increased physical activity in the EC participants as calculated by a kilocalorie per week increase of 40%, versus a 16% decrease in the controls (p=0.49). EC participants who reported “low activity” at baseline experienced an average 110% increase in their physical activity at follow-up. Among the controls who were in the “low activity” group at baseline, there was, on average, only a 12% increase in physical activity (p=0.03). Among those who were previously active, there was no significant difference (p=0.30). The pilot results suggest that a high intensity volunteer program that is designed as a health promotion intervention can lead, in the short-term, to significant improvements in the level of physical activity of previously inactive older adult volunteers.

AB  - In North America, 40–50 per cent of older adults are actively involved as formal volunteers in providing diverse health and human services. We review empirical studies concerning older adults’ motivations for volunteering, as well as the health and morale benefits they derive from this expression of altruism. Knowledge of the exact nature and amount of volunteer activity necessary to produce these effects is limited, and studies have yet to identify the behavioural and psychological mechanisms that are implicated. We propose that older adult volunteers may enjoy good health and longevity because being useful to others instills a sense of being needed and valued. We present several theoretical perspectives on the developmental significance of volunteering, discuss the challenges to volunteerism imposed by the baby boom cohort, and identify future research priorities. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] En Amérique du Nord, 40 à 50 pour cent des aînés participent activement à titre de bénévoles officiels à la prestation de divers services de santé et de services sociaux. Nous avons passé en revue des études empiriques sur les raisons motivant le bénévolat chez les aînés, ainsi que sur les bienfaits sur le moral et la santé que ces derniers tirent de cette expression d'altruisme. La connaissance de la nature exacte et du nombre d'activités bénévoles nécessaires pour produire ces effets est limitée, et les études n'ont pas encore permis de déterminer les mécanismes behavioristes et psychologiques en cause. Nous proposons que les aînés bénévoles pourraient jouir d'une bonne santé et vivre longtemps parce que, en étant utiles à d'autres, ils ont le sentiment qu'on a besoin d'eux et qu'ils sont appréciés. Nous présentons plusieurs points de vue théoriques sur l'importance du bénévolat au plan du développement personnel, discutons des défis imposés au bénévolat par la génération du baby-boom, et déterminons les priorités futures en matière de recherche.

AB  - Demographic transitions in Europe accentuate the need to develop innovative solutions for healthy ageing. One increasingly popular policy approach is co-production between local governments and voluntary community associations (VCOs) to promote activities for health and wellbeing among older adults. While co-production has been studied from the perspective of local governments there is limited knowledge regarding how voluntary associations perceive their conditions. This study aims to fill this gap using survey data from voluntary associations in Denmark. The investigation is based on an electronic survey (n = 263) of VCOs engaged in activities relevant for healthy ageing in three Danish municipalities. The survey addressed 13 issues and potential problems within four categories - ''members and volunteers', 'economics, 'media and the public' and ' politics and the local government'. The paper presents a relatively positive picture of the potentials in municipal-VCO collaboration. However, we also find that a sizeable number of VCOs point to problems and obstacles particular in regards to recruitment of members and economics. While the municipalities in our study have all developed strategies to support VCOs and to promote coproduction it seems that there are deficits in the implementation of the strategies. This leads us to conclude that municipalities must pay close attention to the issues and conditions for VCOs in order to succeed with their policy initiatives in this area.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of background, psychological, and social variables on older adults' well-being, and how this may differ for men and women. Participants included 800 adults from the 2002 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), aged 60 to 101 years old (M = 71.22, SD = 8.46), who completed the optional positive well-being module. Gender-based regression models revealed that for men, marital status, selfrated health, and depression were significant predictors and accounted for 32% of the variability in positive well-being. Similar to men, self-rated health and depression were significant predictors of well-being for women. Additional significant predictors for women included age, the importance of religion, and volunteer work. Combined, these variables explained 35% of the variance in women's positive well-being. These results can help us understand which variables are important to target when developing interventions to improve the well-being of older men and women.

AB  - Social and productive activities have been associated with more favorable well-being and health outcomes in older populations. There is limited consensus on what aspects account for the observed effect and what pathways may underlie their associations. Using data from the 2004 'Survey of Health Aging and Retirement in Europe' (SHARE), based on some 22,000 participants aged 50 and older from ten European countries, this study explores types and quality of productive activities (voluntary work, care for a person, informal help) and its association with two indicators of well-being (depressive symptoms, quality of life). Quality of social productivity is analyzed in the frame of a sociological model based on the notion of exchange reciprocity. Results of multivariate linear regression analysis, adjusted for important confounders, confirm an association of productive activity with well-being. However, this association varies according to experienced quality of exchange: Experienced reciprocity between efforts spent and rewards received is associated with positive well-being (with the exception of caring), while non-reciprocal exchange (high effort and low reward) is associated with negative well-being in all activities. Findings underline the need to improve quality of exchange in socially productive activities as a means of motivating older people to participate in societal life.

AB  - Using the first two waves from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) we explore dynamics of participation in two different types of productive activities (voluntary work and care for a person) and test their association with changes in well-being across 11 European countries (N = 10,309) among people aged 50 and older. In order to measure changes in well-being, we use a standardized instrument of quality of life in early old age (CASP-12) and assess relevant decreases and increases between both waves, applying the Edwards–Nunnally method. Main findings demonstrate that older people who maintain or start their productive activity in terms of volunteering between both waves have a lower probability of experiencing a relevant decrease in wellbeing, while no association with a relevant increase in well-being is observed. In case of caring for a person changes in participation remain unrelated to changes in well-being. These results are maintained after adjusting for important confounders, such as functional limitation, socioeconomic position and living with a partner. These latter conditions were also strongly related to changes in well-being. Our results support a core assumption of the activity theory of ageing claiming that the initiation and maintenance of a productive activity is beneficial for older people’s well-being.

AB  - This article reports that CSV is Great Britain's largest volunteering organisation, with over 10 years' experience of harnessing the energy and dynamism of older volunteers from its Retired and Senior Volunteers Programme (RSVP), and putting it to effective use through its innovative Primary Care scheme. The Primary Care scheme currently deploys over 2,000 volunteers aged 50-plus to help tackle the health problems of older and disadvantaged people caused by inner-city deprivation and rural isolation. There is a fairly even mix of men and women volunteers involved in the scheme, including volunteers with disabilities. The scheme has become so successful that the general practitioners (GP) are now regularly prescribing RSVP volunteers to their patients, and sometimes encourage patients to become volunteers themselves. The volunteers have become a vital extra resource, helping out with non-medical responsibilities, like managing preventative healthcare libraries or manning helpdesks in doctors' surgeries and pharmacies. This has helped to lighten the workloads of GPs and nurses, allowing them to concentrate on providing medical care.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the leisure participation, leisure motivation, and life satisfaction for elders over 65 years of age who lived in public senior resident homes in Taipei and Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Demographic data such as locations, institutions, financial arrangement, gender, age, educational level, marital status, and health condition were investigated as well. The survey instruments included the Leisure Participation Involvement (LPI), Leisure Motivation Scale (LMS), Life Satisfaction Index (LSI-Z), and demographic survey. The LPI was utilized to measure the frequency of participation in 6 different leisure activities: outdoor activities, sports, indoor activities and hobbies, cultural activities and entertainment, social and family activities, and service and volunteer activities. The LMS was used to measure 4 different motivations in leisure: intellectual motivation, social motivation, competence mastery, and stimulus avoidance. The LSI-Z measured the elders' level of satisfaction in life. Finally, a demographic survey provided personal and institutional information. The data collection was conducted at 3 public senior resident homes in Taipei and Kaohsiung. A total number of 416 surveys were collected and 411 were usable. The data was analyzed by using SPSS Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS version 13) computer program for Window XP. The results indicated that leisure participation, leisure motivation, and life satisfaction were correlated with each other. The senior residents who participated in service and volunteer activities were more likely to feel satisfied in life. The senior residents who were motivated by learning, discovering, and exploring also experienced higher level of life satisfaction. In addition, there were differences in leisure participation, leisure motivation, and life satisfaction among demographic groups. The senior residents who were self-paid, attained higher education, married, or possessed good health performed better in leisure participation, leisure motivation, and life satisfaction. It was concluded that the elements of leisure, lifelong learning, volunteerism, support from families, and partnership played important roles in elders' life. For the government, the policy and decision makers should include leisure into senior care institutions so the elders can reach successful aging by experiencing satisfaction in life. On the other hand, the elders should have an understanding of leisure so they can maintain good physical and psychological health in their later life.

AB  - Examined differences between volunteers and nonvolunteers in a random sample of 238 65-74 yr old residents in Brisbane, Australia. Using the theory of planned behavior as a framework, the focus was on the beliefs that distinguished those who volunteer from those who do not. Differences examined included organizations volunteered with, perceived costs and benefits associated with volunteering, beliefs about the influences of others' support on volunteering, and beliefs about the barriers that might prevent volunteering. Results of mailed and telephone surveys show some differences between older Australians who volunteer and those who do not. Specific benefits that emerged suggested both an altruistic and egoistic dimension to volunteering by older adults. The results also suggest that nonvolunteers see being tied down as a barrier to broader volunteer participation. There were also significant differences in normative and control beliefs between those who do and do not volunteer. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent research demonstrates that involvement in productive activities, particularly volunteering, has important societal and individual benefits in the contemporary aging environment. However, less attention has been paid to the structural dimension of volunteering or what encourages or discourages older people regarding volunteering. The authors present the findings from a two-phase Australian case study that explores the incentives and barriers to volunteering by those aged 50 and older, all members of a national seniors organization. Results suggest that governments and organizations need to consider many issues if more seniors are to be attracted to volunteering. Ensuring appropriate incentives to encourage volunteering was viewed as particularly important, with incentives including the need for more training, more flexible and diverse options, and more opportunities for intergenerational volunteering. Potential barriers included negative perceptions of volunteer activities, fear of encountering ageism, and concerns about the increasingly regulatory organizational environment.

AB  - In western countries, one of the challenges facing ageing populations is an absence of social roles. One response to this is to volunteer, with evidence suggesting that this assigns meaning to the lives of older people and enhances health and well-being. This holds potential significance for older people from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and particularly those from Asian cultures, where there is evidence that cultural erosion is diminishing older people's traditional roles. However, while volunteering can create role identities for older people, it may also further challenge existing cultural values. This paper debates these issues, drawing on a growing body of evidence relating to volunteering within Asian cultures.

AB  - Warburton J, Jeppsson Grassman E. Variations in older people's social and productive ageing activities across different social welfare regimes Int J Soc Welfare 2011: 20: 180-191 © 2009 The Author, International Journal of Social Welfare © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the International Journal of Social Welfare. This study explores voluntary association involvement by seniors using a six-regime model with Esping-Andersen's three worlds of welfare as a starting point. Current literature is then used to argue for the inclusion of three additional regime types. The model, with its six illustrative countries, is then used to compare type and level of voluntary association membership and volunteering by older people. The first set of findings is a descriptive account of the context of ageing and social welfare in the six countries and the relationship between this context and volunteering by older people. The second set of findings utilises a broad comparative dataset, the World Values Survey (2005-2006), to explore differences in voluntary association involvement more specifically. The analyses suggest that differences across regime types are explainable in terms of the social welfare context. These findings suggest a possible line of approach to understanding differences across countries.

AB  - Studies have convincingly shown that both physical and mental activity are positively associated with cognitive task performance in aging. Little is known, however, about whether still being employed or doing volunteer work, which obviously engages physical and/or mental activity, is similarly associated with cognitive ability at an older age. The current study explored this relationship in 28 volunteers aged sixty years and older. Participants completed a neuropsychological test battery, and data regarding the number of working hours (paid and voluntary) per week were collected. A total of 28 participants were included, 13 of whom worked three or more hours per week. As a group, these active participants achieved better episodic memory, sustained attention and psychomotor speed results. This study shows that older people who are still working demonstrate better neuropsychological task performance. An important question for future research concerns the causality of this relationship. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved) Onderzoek heeft laten zien dat ouderen die actiever zijn op fysiek of mentaal gebied, over het algemeen beter presteren op cognitieve taken. Hangt werkzaam zijn op oudere leeftijd samen met de cognitieve vermogens? Daarover is weinig bekend, ook al gaat nog werkzaam zijn samen met fysieke en/of mentale inspanning. In het huidige onderzoek is de relatie tussen het cognitief functioneren en werkzaam zijn (op vrijwillige of betaalde basis) op latere leeftijd onderzocht bij 28 vrijwilligers van zestig jaar of ouder. Naast de neuropsychologische testprestatie,werd het aantal uren dat deelnemers perweekwerkzaamwaren in kaart gebracht. Van de 28 deelnemers waren er 13 drie uur of meer per week werkzaam. Deze werkende ouderen presteerden beter op taken die het episodische geheugen, de volgehouden aandacht en de psychomotorische verwerkingssnelheid meten. Deze studie toont daarmee aan dat er een relatie bestaat tussen nog werkzaam zijn en het cognitieve functioneren op latere leeftijd. Een belangrijke vraag voor vervolgstudies betreft de causaliteit van deze relatie. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Volunteering is any activity in which time is given freely to benefit another person, group or cause. Volunteering is part of a cluster of helping behaviors, entailing more commitment than spontaneous assistance but narrower in scope than the care provided to family and friends. Although developed somewhat independently, the study of volunteerism and of social activism have much in common. Since data gathering on volunteering from national samples began about a quarter of a century ago, the rate for the United States has been stable or, according to some studies, rising slightly. Theories that explain volunteering by pointing to individual attributes can be grouped into those that emphasize motives or self-understandings on the one hand and those that emphasize rational action and cost-benefit analysis on the other. Other theories seek to complement this focus on individual level factors by pointing to the role of social resources, specifically social ties and organizational activity, as explanations for volunteering. Support is found for all theories, although many issues remained unresolved. Age, gender and race differences in volunteering can be accounted for, in large part, by pointing to differences in self-understandings, human capital, and social resources. Less attention has been paid to contextual effects on volunteering and, while evidence is mixed, the impact of organizational, community, and regional characteristics on individual decisions to volunteer remains a fruitful field for exploration. Studies of the experience of volunteering have only just begun to plot and explain spells of volunteering over the life course and to examine the causes of volunteer turnover. Examining the premise that volunteering is beneficial for the helper as well as the helped, a number of studies have looked at the impact of volunteering on subjective and objective well-being. Positive effects are found for life-satisfaction, self-esteem, self-rated health, and for educational and occupational achievement, functional ability, and mortality. Studies of youth also suggest that volunteering reduces the likelihood of engaging in problem behaviors such as school truancy and drug abuse.

AB  - I use a volunteer process model to organize a review of recent research on volunteerism, focusing mainly on journal articles reporting survey research results. Scholars from several different disciplines and countries have contributed to a body of work that is becoming more theoretically sophisticated and methodologically rigorous. The first stage of the process model--antecedents of volunteering--continues to attract the most attention but more and more scholars are paying attention to the third stage, the consequences of volunteering, particularly with respect to health benefits. The middle stage--the experience of volunteering--remains somewhat neglected, particularly the influence of the social context of volunteer work on the volunteer's satisfaction and commitment.

AB  - Purpose: Research concerned with the relationship between volunteer activity and psychological well-being has typically reported higher levels of well-being among older adult volunteers relative to non-volunteers. However, few studies have examined nonlinear associations between frequency of volunteer activity and well-being. We examined nonlinear associations between hours spent volunteering and psychological well-being, controlling for employment status, partner status, physical health, and education. We also investigated associations between different domains of volunteer activity and well-being, along with the possible moderating effects of gender on these relationships. Design and Methods: We used data from the PATH Through Life Project, a population- based study of Australian adults. Participants consisted of 2,136 older adults aged 64 to 68. Results: Nonlinear associations between hours spent volunteering and psychological well-being were evident, with these associations characterized by inverted U shapes, with nonvolunteers and those volunteering at high levels producing lower well-being scores relative to those volunteering at moderate levels. Few associations between specific domains of volunteer activity and well-being were evident, and no notable gender interactions emerged. Implications: The results point toward optimal frequency of engagement in volunteer activity for psychological well-being as being bounded by upper and lower levels, outside of which benefits to well-being diminish.

AB  - This study examined demographic and psychosocial differences between older Chinese volunteers and non-volunteers. The influences of work-related factors on older Chinese volunteers' post-retirement psychological functioning and life satisfaction were also explored. A total of 501 older Chinese in Hong Kong were individually interviewed. About 65% of them were involved in community voluntary work since their retirement, with an average of four hours per week. Compared to those without voluntary work experiences, older Chinese volunteers had higher educational attainment and reported better physical health, higher self-efficacy, greater life satisfaction, and less psychological distress. Results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that salient correlates of a low level of psychological distress in older Chinese volunteers were high educational attainment, high self-efficacy, perceived good physical health, and high levels of perceived rewards and satisfaction from voluntary work. Self-efficacy and perceived rewards from voluntary work were also salient correlates of life satisfaction for older Chinese volunteers. As hypothesized, work-related factors of perceived rewards and work satisfaction remained significant correlates of older volunteers' psychological well-being, even after controlling for demographic and individual psychosocial factors. Limitations and implications of the study were also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The importance of participation in voluntary formal associations for enhancing health is supported by 4 kinds of evidence. (1) Seven prospective studies of social relations and mortality show the independent effect of formal social participation, net of informal ties. (2) Conceptual analysis demonstrates that voluntary formal associations constitute a separate class of social causation. (3) The authors' factor analysis of data from a sample of 629 nonmetropolitan elderly (aged 60 yrs and older) identified 2 types of formal social participation: 'instrumental,' as in associations that are community oriented, and 'expressive,' as in those that exist for the benefit of the members. (4) Regression analysis showed that the instrumental participation factor is linked, net of controls, to the perceived health of both men and women, whereas the expressive factor predicts for women only.

AB  - The positive association between volunteering and health has been widely interpreted as evidence of the salutary effect of volunteering during adulthood. Using three waves of data from a national survey, this study uses structural equation models to examine the relationships among volunteering, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms during middle and later adulthood. The findings reveal a salutary effect of volunteering in later life as well as a compensatory mechanism. By contrast, only a barrier mechanism was uncovered in middle age: Depressive symptoms decreased volunteer participation over time. The results demonstrate life course variation in the relationship between volunteering and health and suggest greater attention to selection processes in the study of social engagement and health.

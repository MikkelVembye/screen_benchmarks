AB  - N. L. Weatherby et al (see record [rid]1995-19035-001[/rid]) respond to a comment by E. D. Wish and T. Mieczkowski (see record [rid]1995-17914-001[/rid]) by questioning the idiosyncratic label given by Wish and Mieczkowski to the original drug user Ss. Weatherby et al state that it is premature to conclude that biological assays should always be required, suggesting further studies to confirm the status of urinalysis testing in drug self-reporting Ss.

AB  - This thesis examines how cultural competency operates as a regime of governmentality. Inspired by Foucauldian genealogy, institutional ethnography, and Said's concept of contrapuntality, this thesis problematizes the seamless production of racialized bodies in relation to mental disorder. I begin by elaborating a theoretical framework for interpreting race and madness as mutually constructed ordering practices. I then analyze what cultural competence produces and sustains in a position paper published by the Ontario Federation of Community Mental Health and Addiction Programs. I argue the Federation dismisses ongoing institutional violence—suggesting it is simply the perception, as opposed to the everyday reality, of discrimination that causes problems such as low educational attainment among youth of colour. To further support this claim, I deconstruct narratives of low self-esteem, maladaptive coping, depression, and denial of mental illness in the community needs assessments of two of the Federation's member organizations: Hong Fook and Across Boundaries.

AB  - Presents a brief history of the work of The Samaritans in Thailand, a member of Befrienders International. The Samaritans began with a telephone crisis intervention hotline in Bangkok in 1978, for those in need of emotional support. With the many rapid changes that have taken place--the transformation of Thailand from an agriculture-based country to a newly industrialized country, the change from an extended-family pattern to that of the nuclear family, the migration of people from rural areas to the competitive urban environment, etc.--there has been an increase in social problems leading to more people becoming distressed and suicidal. Recognizing the increase in the need for their services, The Samaritans took the proactive approach of reaching out to the suicidal rather than just waiting to be contacted. The Outreach Program The Samaritans initiated was, however, not limited to the high-risk group resulting from the changes to society; it also covers those stricken by disease, and it aims to educate school-children as a means of suicide prevention.

AB  - Abstract: Little is known about HIV infection risks and risk behaviours of refugees living in resource-scarce post-emergency phase camps in Africa. Our study at Nyarugusu Camp in Tanzania, covering systematically selected refugees (n=1140) and refugees living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) (n=182), revealed that the level of HIV risk of systematically selected refugees increased after displacement, particularly regarding the number having transactional sex for money or gifts, while radio broadcast messages are perceived to promote a base of risk awareness within the refugee community. While condoms are yet to be widely used in the camp, some refugees having transactional sex tended to undertake their own health initiatives such as using a condom, under the influence of peer refugee health workers, particularly health information team (HIT) members. Nevertheless, PLWHA were less faithful to one partner and had more non-regular sexual partners than the HIV-negative group. Our study revealed that community-based outreach by refugee health workers is conducive to risk behaviour prevention in the post-emergency camp setting. It is recommended to increase the optimal use of “radio broadcast messages” and “HIT,” which can act as agents to reach out to wider populations, and to strengthen the focus on safer sex education for PLWHA; the aim being to achieve dual risk reduction for both refugees living with and without HIV/AIDS.

AB  - Abstract: There is a rapidly increasing demand for hydropower in China. However, little research has been conducted to systematically investigate the overall aspects of hydropower development risks. With support of the data collected from a fieldwork survey, this study reports the multiple facets of hydropower development risks in China as perceived by main project participants. All groups have a common view on the criticality of safety, and the groups also have their own priorities, i.e., resettlement of migrants, incompetence of subcontractors, project delay, inadequate or incorrect design, premature failure of facilities and ecological and environmental impacts are the key risks to clients, whereas quality of work, financial related risks, reputation, and claims and disputes are the main concerns to contractors. A case study of Three Gorges Project further demonstrates that, hydropower development risks can be effectively managed by encouraging joint efforts of all participants to achieve the goals on producing renewable energy, reducing emissions of CO2, and providing important social/economical benefits. Future hydropower development should emphasize the interactions between project delivery, environmental, and economical processes to reach appropriate trade-offs among involving stakeholders, by adequately considering the inter-relations between project participants' risks as well as hydropower project's externalities on a broad view.

AB  - Educational targeting has become one of the hegemonic mechanisms in the fight against poverty. Both international organisms and developing countries support targeting as one of the best strategies in order to simultaneously guarantee poverty reduction and economic growth, and consequently to tackle the challenges generated by globalisation. The main objective of the article is to point out some of the limits, omissions and opportunities of educational targeting as a priority strategy to fight against poverty. In doing so, it analyses the World Bank's proposals in education, poverty and targeting and it presents one of the targeting pioneering programmes implemented in Latin America: the Bolsa Escola programme (BE). An analysis of the impacts of the programme is also included. This analysis is based on the results of an intensive qualitiative fieldwork containing more than 80 interviews with mothers and students who benefit from the programme as well as with teaching staff. The analysis demonstrates that although targeting could be a necessary and useful strategy, it is not sufficient either for ensuring school attainment or for reducing poverty.

AB  - Workshop participants are given an in depth orientation to the project, including current delinquency prevention theories and prevention principles and strategies to more effectively serve 'youth at risk' in the Boys Club community. 'At-risk' is defined to include youth who have school problems, have run away from home, are abused and/or neglected, and are substance abusers or come from a substance-abusing family. Targeted Outreach attempts to preclude initial occurrence of delinquency and to correct casual processes before delinquent adaptation emerges or becomes well established. As a result of this training, workshop participants will have: (1) an understanding of the Delinquency Intervention Project; (2) developed and increased understanding of Delinquency Prevention theories and principles; (3) developed an action plan to establish and/or improve networks and referral systems; and, (4) developed an action plan to implement programs and activities to better serve youth at risk.

AB  - One of the unique features of the Targeted Outreach Project has been the formation of Clusters of Clubs within a given geographical area. One section of the guide describes the merits of a collaborative venture and provides tested guidelines for organizing and operating the collaboration. Another section contains sample proposals that can be adapted by any club for submission to the United Way, foundations, and government agencies. Proposal writing is discussed in one section. It includes narratives about how to write each section of a proposal for funding a delinquency prevention program. It contains examples of how each proposal section might appear, suggestions for developing the proposal, and ideas about how to approach funding sources. A fourth section provides a presentation that clubs may use or adapt when making a presentation to the United Way or foundation. The presentation is preceded by an instruction page that contains suggestions for adapting and delivering the presentation. A section on 'Foundation Search' presents examples of delinquency intervention programs that were recently funded by foundations, so as to indicate the variety and types of projects being funded. It also provides a list of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of foundations that fund youth service agencies and delinquency prevention projects. Other sections of the guide contain a list of all the State Juvenile Justice Advisory Councils and a list of additional resources available from Boys Clubs of America's Targeted Outreach Project, including publications, proposals, and presentations.

Indeed, the arcane nature of the statutes and rules surrounding Individualized Education Programs, or IEPs, often seem at odds with a caregiver's eagerness to ensure academic success for a beloved child. Practical matters, too, such as financing for much needed services for the few while ensuring fair access to educational resources for all students, can set the stage for miscommunication, mistrust, and bad or hurt feelings on both sides of the table. Meanwhile, children waiting for services languish. Further, because lack of funds tends to be a key issue for families, there often is a dearth of effective advocacy available to help the process move efficiently and appropriately forward. Meanwhile, legal education is in a constant struggle to provide practical, meaningful, and concrete experiences that allow students to delve into the everyday practice of law. This paper explores how one program, the IEP Project out of WMU Cooley Law School, helped law students hone their advocacy and dispute resolution skills while assisting parents and school administrators through the IEP process. Their goal was to create a calm and efficient process that culminated in the student involved receiving appropriate accommodations and services. Additionally, this project exposed law students to the most at-risk members of their communities and worked to inspire some to continue to serve that population as legal professionals.

AB  - This study examines the effect of a provider alliance on service utilization, satisfaction , self efficacy, and attachment to a regular source of care for participating low income urban children and their families. The use of Physician Assistants and community health workers to expand community outreach, primary care services, pediatric sub-specialty care, and service coordination within and between care settings improved health services utilization, satisfaction with health services, parental self efficacy in navigating the health care system for their children, and service convenience for an at-risk population. Also, the use of Physician Assistants to provide pediatric sub-specialty services did not have a negative effect on parental satisfaction with a child's care. Parents were slightly more satisfied with services received from a Physician Assistant in comparison with the physician sub- specialists in cardiology and nephrology clinics.

AB  - This dissertation investigates why, in a country with an educational system that has historically been reliant on exams, there is such a fevered pitch around exams in India today-and why suicide has become such a prominent response to unexpected or disappointing outcomes in exams. I examined what the discourses and practices around secondary school board [10th and 12th grades] exams are saying about the society and culture of urban North India at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This work highlights a relatively un-remarked stage of life and brings the experiences of middle class students to the fore. The experience of educational distress serves as a window through which to understand links between processes within family and school, and public culture, which generates discourses on adolescence and stress and depression. This project offers an opportunity to trace the movement of international mental health imperatives to local settings, and to examine the expression of mental distress in a setting of rapid social and cultural change. This dissertation will study distress around education, and discourses about student suicide from the standpoint of students, families, and mental health practitioners-particularly NGOs concerned with student mental health. The English language press plays a role in the discursive formation of educational distress. The newspapers help set up conditions that make exams important, while at the same time running the risk of amplifying the problem of exam stress and student suicide. Drawing from fieldwork carried in New Delhi, India from September 2001 to August 2002, I argue that discourses and practices around education serve multiply as idioms of distress and as part of middle class cultural practice at a time when a 'politics of visibility' has forced a greater publicity of otherwise unspoken aspects of educational practice. The distress around education communicates ambivalence over societal and cultural changes; it involves a fight over what is included in the ambit of consumption; and serves as a context through which arguments over the values that define one as a modern citizen are taking place-through which families stake their claim to a certain place in society.

AB  - This project was designed to address the holistic needs of inner-city youth in Huntersville, a community disturbed by delinquency in Norfolk, Virginia. It involved a contextual analysis of Union United Church of Christ, the community, and the participants, using a dialogical workshop method called See-Judge-Act. This project engaged youth in learning experiences to help them when confronted by societal ills. The skills taught prevented youth from becoming involved in delinquent acts. This document described the context, researcher, methodology, and field experience. The results show that the teen church school increased as a result of the model.

AB  - Young homeless people have mental health needs. Research and national policies have highlighted that accommodation providers need to offer holistic interventions to encourage this vulnerable group to break the cycle of homelessness. Currently no research literature documents how homeless shelters respond to mental health needs. This research was intended to address this research question. A postal questionnaire was sent to 132 managers of homeless shelters, achieving a response rate of 64.4%. Frequencies and descriptive statistics were calculated, and written data was analysed using content analysis. Mental health problems were highly prevalent, and homeless shelters responded in a variety of ways (use of GP services, internal services, referring to external services, in-house outreach services, no service provision, etc). Only 27.1% of managers of homeless shelters reported that their services were sufficient to meet their young people's needs. These findings reflect the need for inclusion of mental health in homeless shelters' strategic objectives, and development of commissioning of local partnerships with health agencies.

AB  - This project was an exploratory effort to screen and treat immigrant Yemeni children who were at high risk for lead poisoning. The Detroit metropolitan area is home to the largest number of Arabic immigrants in the United States. In addition, Detroit has the largest rate of childhood lead poisoning in the state of Michigan. No published studies were found that explored the prevalence of lead poisoning among Yemeni children in Michigan. Immigrant children from countries where knowledge of lead poisoning is limited may be particularly vulnerable because of difficulties in language and accessing health care. Children's Hospital of Michigan CATCH School Mobile Health Center conducted this health-screening project. This article reports on the gender and health issues encountered during the community outreach lead testing effort within a Yemeni neighborhood in Detroit.

AB  - Aim To identify effective approaches to recognize diabetes risk and prevent progression to Type 2 diabetes in vulnerable groups, whose diabetes risk may be difficult to identify or manage. Methods UK-based interventions that assess diabetes risk and/or target known risk factors were identified through four main sources: submissions to two calls for evidence by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence; local practice examples collected via a targeted email questionnaire; selected electronic databases; and a focused search of relevant websites. No restriction was placed on the study type or evaluation methods used. Key themes and sub-themes on outcomes, as well as facilitators and barriers to successful delivery, are reported. Results Twenty-four interventions met all inclusion criteria: 15 included a risk identification element and 14 included preventative activities. A range of risk identification tools were used to improve diagnosis of unmet diabetes-related health needs and raise awareness of diabetes risk factors. All preventative interventions focused on lifestyle change. No interventions monitored blood glucose as an outcome and only one reported improvements in baseline risk scores. Facilitators included tailored and flexible programme design, outreach delivery in familiar locations and effective inter-agency working. Barriers included literacy and language difficulties, transient participant populations, low prioritization of diabetes prevention and cost. Conclusions It is possible to engage successfully with high-risk adults in vulnerable groups to achieve positive health outcomes relevant to the prevention of diabetes. However, more robust evidence on longer-term outcomes is required to ensure that programmes are targeted and delivered appropriately.

AB  - In this riposte to Stuart and Maynard’s article, I will concentrate on unravelling their explanation of what constitutes youth development. Given the promiscuous desire nowadays to use and abuse the term youth work if and when it suits, their attempted clarity is enormously valuable. Placing itself in the camp of non-formal learning, youth development is described as a structured and planned intervention into young people’s lives with identified and intended outcomes, which, Stuart and Maynard claim, is robust and rigorous. I offer the following doubts in a critical rather than antagonistic spirit, arguing that, at the very least, youth development is as riven with contradiction as the youth work which, in these three articles, we seek to defend and nurture.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a prenatal intervention for low income African-American women on the adjustment of their children 4 to 5 years after participation in the intervention. The purpose of the intervention was to reduce the risk of low birth weight. The intervention included health education services that addressed all of the known health and social risk factors associated with low birth weight. These services included (a) outreach, (b) linkage to various health agencies, and social services, and (c) health education about prenatal care, preterm labor, weight gain, smoking, drinking, drug use, and physical and emotional stress. Over 3,000 women participated in this six year intervention effort. For this study 30 African-American mothers who had received the original intervention and the children with whom they were pregnant at the time of the intervention were participants in this study along with 30 matched comparison group mothers and their children. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between mother's participation in the intervention and child and maternal risk outcomes. Specifically, this study compared the cognitive, behavioral, and adaptive adjustment of prenatal intervention participant children with those whose mothers did not participate in this intervention. There were no significant differences between the intervention and comparison groups on any of the child adjustment variables examined. There were, however, a number of absolute differences in means between the groups that were in the expected direction. There also were no significant differences between mothers in the comparison and intervention groups on health risk behaviors exhibited during a subsequent pregnancy. Mothers who exhibited more health risk behaviors during the pregnancy of the initial child were more likely to have babies with lower birth weights, as well as with higher internalizing behavior problems when followed up. For this study, mothers who di (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major problem in the United States, yet little is known about the efficacy of intervention studies focused on enhancing completion of TB prevention programs among PPD positive homeless men and women, many of whom are addicted to drugs and alcohol, at risk for active TB, hard to reach and difficult to treat. In this prospective two-group quasi-experimental design, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a theoretically-based preventive intervention program focused primarily on compliance with TB chemoprophylaxis treatment, and secondarily on HIV risk reduction, with 480 sheltered men and women in the high TB prevalence area of Skid Row in Los Angeles. Initially, screening for chemoprophylaxis eligibility will be conducted with 6424 sheltered homeless living in the Skid Row area with anticipated PPD testing on a sample of 2762. Subsequent to final approval for chemoprophylaxis, a sample of 600 PPD positive homeless will be randomized by shelter into one of two programs, a Nurse Case Managed Plus Incentive (NCMI) Program or a Control Program. Participants in the NCMI program will receive the intervention by trained research nurses and outreach workers at the TB Satellite Clinic weekly over eight weeks, along with biweekly Directly Observed (DOT) and incentives for six months. Control group participants will receive basic care which includes biweekly DOT visits at the TB Satellite Clinic, and incentives for six months. All participants will be assessed at baseline and six-month follow-up using a battery of psychosocial, behavioral, health and physical status measures. The Comprehensive Health Seeking and Coping Paradigm will serve as the theoretical underpinning for guiding the assessment and implementation of strategies related to health outcome in this study. The long term goals of the study are to design effective programs for sheltered homeless individuals that focus on decreasing the spread of TB directly via completion of TB preventive programs for PPD positive individuals and indirectly via reduction of risk for HIV.

AB  - Co-housing is a form of intentional community that encourages shared living and sees members jointly build and develop urban housing projects. Through an emphasis on traffic-free developments and reference to strong community sentiment, co-housing is construed by parents as providing a safer and more desirable location for raising children. Drawing on fieldwork in two Canadian co-housing developments, this paper demonstrates how parents are able to mediate risks associated with traffic, bullies, and strangers.

AB  - In recent decades the global number of children living and working on the streets has risen dramatically, becoming the focus of considerable anthropological research. Visible examples of street children in Kathmandu and other urban centers in Nepal appeared by the late 1980s, when concerned Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) started to take notice and launch programs intended to help these children. This thesis examines a representative sample of street children in Kathmandu through their lived experiences on the street and in an NGO-run shelter. This thesis is based on 4 and 1/2 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Nepal. An internship was established at a drop-in shelter run by Child Workers In Nepal (CWIN), one of the first NGOs to take on child's rights issues in the country. The other primary location where fieldwork was conducted was on the streets of Thamel, the tourist district in Kathmandu and a favored spot among street children.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of alcohol abuse and tobacco consumption on mental and physical health among the Hispanic population in the United States. The population presented in the study is young and middle-aged adults between 18 and 35 years of age. The independent variables include alcohol abuse and tobacco consumption. The dependent variables are mental health, and physical well-being. This research project was a quantitative study which used secondary data retrieved from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). A sub-sample of 35,838 Hispanic respondents was extracted from BRFSS. Those who identified as a non-drinker (abstainer) tended to rate their general health less favorably compared to those who identified as drinkers. Results show that smoking and self-rated general health are significantly related. Those who smoked every day tended to rate their health less favorably compared to those who do not smoke at all. Contrary to my hypothesis, it was found that those who do not drink at all (abstainer) reported more days of poor mental health, while those who reported to drink had fewer days of poor mental health, results were statistically significant. Those who smoked cigarettes were more likely to experience more days of poor mental health than those that did not smoke cigarettes, the relationship between smoking and poor mental health was statistically significant. Community education for smokers targeting the Hispanic population should be a key factor to educate the community on smoking. It is important to educate the Hispanic community on smoking because it will raise awareness on the effects that smoking has on individual’s general health and mental health. This research gives the impression that there is a high possibility that other factors influence poor mental health among the Hispanic community. It is my suggestion that more research should be conducted to examine other factors that contribute to poor mental health to bring awareness to the community. If the community is aware of other factors that potentially affect their mental health, the community will benefit from being educated on mental health. This present research revealed that more outreach programs targeting the Hispanic population should be developed aiming to educate the importance of receiving mental health services. It is important to promote health practices to aim for the Hispanic community to begin practicing healthy living. Outreach programs to target the general health of the population will assist the population is healthy living. As social workers, our goal is to assure that we provide more culturally appropriate services to the Hispanic population.

AB  - Public health nurses (PHNs) use the intervention of outreach to improve health status by locating 'at-risk' or 'of interest' populations, providing information about health concerns and linking the population to resources to address the health concerns. The purpose of this study was to analyze PHNs' use of the intervention of outreach. Knowledge about best practices can contribute to the ability to successfully implement outreach activities. The descriptive qualitative study involved interviewing 10 Minnesota PHNs. Findings suggest strategies to increase outreach effectiveness. Recommendations include providing education on population-based concepts, such as community assessment and at-risk populations, and using interventions from the Public Health Intervention Wheel in conjunction with outreach.

AB  - Graduate schools of social work have made infrequent use of public health settings as a locus for practice education & a particular resource for learning in prevention. Described is a three-year project aimed at the development of an educational model in preventive work with families & children, using a student unit in fieldwork in a county health department. The project emphasizes early intervention with concern for development & life cycle tasks of families. Process evaluation indicates clearer identification of populations "at risk" & changes in student appreciation of collaborative roles with other disciplines in patient care, as well as specific learning of tasks & roles associated with screening, case findings, referral, & treatment.

AB  - Presents the model used by YouthCare, a project for youth who are HIV-positive or at high risk for becoming HIV positive. Throughout its 23-yr history, YouthCare has focused on serving runaway, homeless, sexual minority, and other youth 'on the margins.' To respond effectively to the needs of these youth, YouthCare has developed creative service approaches including involving youth in program design and taking the programs to where the youth live. The 5 major elements of the model include: (a) youth-specific HIV antibody test counseling, (b) outreach, (c) intensive case management for HIV-positive youth, (d) prevention services for youth at high risk of HIV infection, and (e) peer involvement. Preliminary results from qualitative evaluations have stressed the importance of teamwork in designing clinical interventions and providing support to direct-service staff. The authors of this paper stress that case management for this population, even though time and resource-intensive, is effective, and that services need to be flexible and tailored to each client's needs.

AB  - This paper compares homeless veterans with homeless nonveterans from different eras in an effort to better understand the connection between military service and urban homelessness. Two research questions are addressed based on interviews with over 4,000 homeless men who enrolled in a national outreach program for persons suffering from serious mental illness: First, is there anything unique in the social and personal characteristics of homeless veterans in the 1990s that would help to explain their relatively high prevalence in the homeless population, especially among those who were 19 or younger when the draft ended in 1973? Second, aside from age, are the homeless veterans of the era of the All-Volunteer Force different from homeless veterans who served during the era of the military draft? The results replicate many findings from research in the 1980s showing that even homeless veterans with psychiatric disorders tend to have more personal resources compared to homeless men who did not serve in the Armed Forces. Although veterans from the era of the All-Volunteer Force are different from veterans from the era of the draft, the introduction of the All-Volunteer Force per se does not appear to have changed the composition of the adult male homeless population.

AB  - Nurse-managed clinics can be an effective strategy for addressing the health care needs of homeless and indigent populations. The role of the nurse manager in the establishment of a clinic involves community leadership--specifically, it involves addressing strategic planning, financial, and manpower issues. The collaborative relationship of nurse managers, educators, and the community laid the groundwork for accessible and affordable health care for the homeless and indigent of one northwest Georgia community. Specific tools and strategies are presented.

AB  - Primary prevention is concerned with preventing children at risk of becoming juvenile offenders from committing their first offenses. Secondary prevention involves intervention with juvenile offenders in the early stages of their offending histories to prevent further involvement in the juvenile justice system. Tertiary prevention focuses on the rehabilitation of hardcore, serious offenders. Information on each program encompasses the target population, program description, the number of juveniles served, program cost, the agencies involved, program objectives/benefits, and the name and phone number of a contact person. There are 20 categories of programs, with a number of individual programs described under each category. The program categories include 'Choices' programs (emphasis on proper behavioral choices), community service restitution programs, constructive activity programs, education/awareness programs, employment/vocational/work study programs, family programs, first offender/shoplifter programs, foster home programs, intensive supervision programs, mediation programs, outreach programs, and reintegration/independent living programs.

AB  - Student loans are likely to remain a prominent instrument for paying for college in Texas, a necessary financial tool for low- and moderate-income students. As college costs rise and growing enrollments further stretch grant funds, the policy challenge is to assist students in determining the appropriate level of student loans for their individual situation. The process begins with quality college outreach services to high school students. Financial literacy training can help students manage their finances and plan their careers wisely, providing reasonable loan debt and salary expectations. Professional, qualified loan counseling can help students better understand their loan obligations, and a neutral party can advocate on behalf of students and provide essential delinquency and default prevention services to keep them in repayment. Although they carry some risk, student loans are a necessary tool for promoting college access and success, allowing students to enroll full time and work a minimum number of hours. This can enhance the quality of the educational experience and reduce the number of years to degree, saving money for both the student and the state.

AB  - Beyond criminalization and punishment, how do police engage in social control in marginalized communities? This dissertation complicates how scholars understand the entwined relationship between criminal justice institutions and vulnerable youth by examining the case of junior police academies, school-police partnerships that expose youth to educational resources and law enforcement careers. In three papers, this research draws from 25 months of fieldwork and interviews with 171 respondents to conceptualize the various dimensions of police power and how they are embedded in everyday life. The first paper develops the concept of valorization as a form of symbolic social control. The second paper explains how youth negotiate their roles as valorized junior police cadets while living in a context of historically tense police-community relations. The third paper uncovers how the process of valorization reinforces racialized, gendered, and classed inequalities. This project shows the nuanced implications of these academies by highlighting both their benefits and unintended consequences: though valorization is advantageous for individual youth, it also upholds the stigma and criminalization of marginalized communities, thereby legitimizing the hierarchical social and political order.

AB  - This report presents a summary of the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget for the National Drug Control Strategy within the three key priority areas; education and community action, treatment and intervention, and disruption in the illegal drug market. The first chapter, "Stopping Drug Use Before It Starts," outlines the Administration's work to prevent the initiation of drug use. An integral part of this effort is the new "Above the Influence" initiative by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)--National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign--and the Partnership for a Drug Free America. This initiative, which consists of television advertisements and interactive web-based outreach, calls on young people to be true to themselves by remaining "above the influence." The second chapter, "Healing America's Drug Users," highlights initiatives that treat drug users. Key initiatives include the President's Access to Recovery program, which expands treatment options, and drug courts, which seek to rehabilitate offenders with substance abuse problems. The third chapter, "Disrupting Drug Markets," outlines the Administration's work at home and abroad to disrupt the availability of illicit drugs, through source country efforts, interdiction programs, and investigative operations. We are attacking market vulnerabilities in the illegal drug trade and applying pressure to reduce profits and raise the risks of drug trafficking. As in past years, this year's "National Drug Control Strategy" highlights the good work faith-based and community organizations are doing to combat the scourge of illicit drugs in their own communities. The Strategy seeks to harness these efforts, and the work of state and local officials, so that Americans work together to reach the President's goal of reducing overall drug use.

AB  - Evaluating treatment outcomes for programs serving individuals who are homeless and mentally ill presents many challenges in terms of measures available and timeframes for data collection and analysis. These difficulties pose significant obstacles in terms of responsiveness to the need for short-term justification of program funding and for program modifications to improve operations. Information is presented from a 2-site intervention in Michigan, providing outreach and in vivo services to individuals who are homeless and mentally ill, which measured client engagement with project services. Descriptive information was collected from 270 eligible clients (aged 18–70 yrs) from the screening instrument and from agency records (shelters, hospitals, and community mental health caseloads of aftercare clients). Three categories of engagement status were found to be related to recruitment source for one site and to change over time, reflecting differential success with subgroups of eligible participants. The data and experiences in using a measure of engagement status in analyses substantiate the concurrent validity of the construct and its utility to project operations. Discussion focuses on interpretation of program-level and individual client differences in engagement status. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article describes the first feasibility study in comprehensive neighborhood mapping (CNM), in Craigmillar, a public housing estate in south-east Edinburgh. The study is based on the sexual abuse prevention schema for communities designed by the authors. CNM aims to promote safer neighborhoods in areas of multiple disadvantage. The feasibility study was launched in February 2003. Womanzone, a voluntary sector community health project based in Craigmillar which highlights the impact of sexual violence on women and children, had long been keen to progress a CNM project and provide a base for a researcher. Funding proved problematic, but resources sufficient for 8 months' research were eventually secured from a variety of sources. A project steering group, which included the Craigmillar Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP), police, social work, community education, health and local residents, met regularly to take forward the study. The audit revealed considerable socioeconomic and health disadvantage. It suggested a need to target particular groups of carers for support in keeping their children safe. When they discussed dangers to children and teenagers, people did not confine the risks to sexual crime, but also identified dangerous physical environments, physical violence, neglect or the risks of school truancy. The study recommended that a larger implementation group, interconnected with key area initiatives, be set up from the steering group. Recommendations included appointing outreach youth workers and developing a daytime facility for pupils not attending or excluded from school and initiating round-table agency talks about thresholds of intervention, among others. Many positive ideas for increasing community safety from sexual crime, sufficient for at least a 5-year implementation program, can be generated by the CNM approach.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to examine familial and environmental predictors of intimate partner violence among 172 homeless young adults in the Midwestern United States. Young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Intimate partner violence is prevalent among this high-risk group of youth: approximately 86% reported being involved in a violent intimate relationship as a perpetrator, victim, or perpetrator-victim. Additionally, 59% of young people indicated that at least one of their close friends had stolen from them, beaten them up, sexually assaulted them, and/or pressured them to have sex on at least one occasion. The results from logistic regression revealed that homeless youth who were female, older, experienced more neglect, and victimized by their close friends were significantly more likely to be involved in violent intimate relationships. Early intervention programs are needed to break the cycle of abuse that many youth experience first within the family and then later with intimate partners. Without intervention, many of these young people are at risk for continued exploitation and re-victimization on the street from intimate partners and other individuals. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Abstract: Background. : A disproportionate number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer are from low-income and/or ethnically diverse groups. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an outreach and counseling intervention at improving the rate of follow-up of abnormal Pap smears among women at Alameda County Medical Center, Oakland, CA. Methods. : Between September 1, 1999 and August 31, 2001, 348 women with abnormal Pap test results were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care. The main outcome was rate of follow-up. Results. : The intervention produced a significant increase in the rate of follow-up visits within 6 months. Women in the intervention group were much more likely to obtain timely follow-up at Highland Hospital than were those in the control group (61% vs. 32%, P = 0.001). The intervention was equally effective when delivered to women in the control group who had no follow-up by 6 months. Overall, we were able to contact 90% of women in the intervention group. Conclusions. : An outreach intervention is highly effective at increasing follow-up of abnormal Pap smears in a public hospital setting. Institutions offering cervical cancer screening to low-income, high-risk women should consider the use of outreach workers to reduce loss to follow-up.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to examine outcomes of reciprocal intimate partner violence among 199 homeless young adults in the Midwestern United States. Young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Results revealed that homeless youth who were victimized by their partner more often were significantly more likely to have traded sex, to have been sexually victimized on the street by someone other than an intimate partner, to have higher levels of illicit drug use, to have thought about suicide, to have engaged in numerous forms of self-mutilation, and to have higher levels of depressive symptoms and post traumatic stress symptoms. Additionally, reciprocal violence by homeless youth (i.e., those who admitted to victimizing their partners) was also significantly associated with many of the same high-risk outcomes. The results suggest that reciprocal violence is prevalent among this high-risk group of youth. Early intervention programs are needed to break the cycle of abuse that many youth experience first within the family and then later with intimate partners. Without intervention, many of these young people are at risk for continued exploitation and re-victimization on the street from intimate partners and other individuals. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - The 99 campus strong Knowledge Is Power Program (KIPP) is the best known of the "no excuses" high poverty/high achievement charter school networks. We spent eight days of fieldwork at two KIPP campuses in Arkansas in June and July 2010, to be supplemented by additional fieldwork. We observed KIPP recruiting practices, "commitment meetings" for new students and parents, and the first days of KIPP summer school for new students. We use psychological and sociological lenses to explain how KIPP develops a student culture. Our fieldwork suggests that KIPP leaders attempt to recruit disadvantaged students rather than "creaming." KIPP leaders then use what social psychologists refer to as "foot in the door techniques" to gain compliance with organization values. These include the use of contracts in formal commitment meetings. KIPP uses summer school for new students not for academic purposes (save for proficiency testing), but rather as an induction to build school culture. KIPP leaders do this through constant feedback to students, frequent repetition of KIPP values and goals, by leading by example, and by limiting peer and family influences. Elements of KIPP culture include loyalty to the KIPP identity, politeness, obedience to teachers, comfort with routines, respect for fellow students, and constant attention to learning with the ultimate goal of collegiate success. We conclude by tying this into the broader school reform literature, suggesting ways in which traditional public schools could replicate parts of the KIPP model for disadvantaged students. We also discuss potential controversies.

Discussion includes the goals and objectives of the health outreach team, the different kinds of client interactions, some of the skills that are needed, and how the team's work differs from that of other agencies. Case histories illustrate the outreach team's techniques of (1) making initial contact with street clients, (2) health assessment, and (3) case management. The development of resources and street-based health services to clients is discussed, as well as the team's limitations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Summarizes the major findings of the qualitative component of an evaluation conducted on the Homeless Prenatal Program (HPP) in 1992. The evaluation indicated that HPP is achieving its program goals of improving birth outcomes and transforming the lives of its clients. Specific emphasis is given to HPP's model of service delivery and empowerment, and the implications of the model for health education practice. In the service model, empowerment has 2 central tenets, derived from the special needs of homeless pregnant (HP) women: the 'mother–child connection,' (MCC) and the principle of 'giving back.' The MCC is the hook that brings women into HPP for services and support and serves as the catalyst for the personal transformation of HP women. The primary role of the community health outreach workers (recruited from former clients of the HPP) is to give back and become mothers to women who are like themselves and who are like they once were.

AB  - This article explores field researchers’ perceptions of field site security and causes of fieldwork disruption. We seek to quantify what phenomena are decisive in perceiving a field site insecure and to gauge whether researchers find rural or urban areas to be more secure from organized criminal violence. We also identify the conditions that best predict scholars’ willingness to abandon research in any given region. To do so, we use a regression analysis of the results of a survey administered to anthropologists working in Mexico and Central America. The article reveals that anthropologists view urban areas as being less secure and that they are most likely to consider a field site insecure and abandon field research when manifestations of organized violence such as the discovery of clandestine mass graves and the gruesome displays of victims become too obvious. Our survey results are intended to supply applied anthropologists with information that may be helpful when planning their own safety precautions and to spur discussion of the effects that the violence has on development practice.

AB  - The Chicago Project for Violence Prevention (CeaseFire) is a strategic public health effort to stop violence, specifically shootings and killings. The Project works with community organizations, outreach workers, law enforcement, and faith leaders to develop neighborhood strategies to reduce community violence. This paper will explore the work done to mediate conflicts by CeaseFire outreach workers and "violence interrupters", to determine the types of conflicts mediated and the outcomes achieved. Outreach workers engage high risk youth with positive alternatives and connect them with resources, while "violence interrupters" work primarily with gang leaders to mediate inter-gang disputes that are likely to turn violent. In 2006, violence interrupters mediated an average of 7.2 conflicts while outreach workers mediated only 1.5 per worker. There have been steady increases in the number of mediations as well as the ability to analyze the mediations for factors and outcomes related to street violence since 2004. Beginning with 152 mediations in 2004, the number has steadily increased to 345 in 2005 and 379 in 2006. Preliminary analysis of 2006 showed; 65% of these conflicts were gang related, 62% involved a weapon, 42% were retaliations, and almost 90% of the conflicts were thought to have led to a shooting. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This study aims to understand the routine of the street outreach office team regarding the attention paid to the homeless. It is a holistic qualitative multiple case study, based on Michel Maffesoli's Comprehensive and Quotidian Sociology. It was performed using two key informants and 20 professionals of the street outreach office of two capitals in the South of Brazil. For data analysis, we used the Thematic Content Analysis.The itinerancy, the unexpected and the immediacy of homeless people are part of the team's everyday life. The potentialities of the teams are their intra- and intersectoral networks; inter- and transdisciplinarity; and available material/diagnostic resources, whereas the limitations are their inequalities, vulnerabilities and social exclusion, in addition to the specificities of the homeless and the multiple problems that these people live with. Understanding the routine of the street outreach office reveals co-responsibility in unique actions aligned with the needs of the homeless, precisely signalling that health care needs to be integrated into a network so that these individuals can meet the complex challenges of living in unsafe street environments.

AB  - University social work programs can play a critical role in helping communities to expand local capacity in efforts to end homelessness. The Supplemental Security Income/Social Security Disability Insurance (SSI/SSDI) Outreach, Access and Recovery (SOAR) program is an evidence-based model that social work programs are advancing through university–community partnerships. SOAR seeks to prevent and end homelessness through increased access to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for people suffering from chronic homelessness and who also have a disability. This article uses a case study approach to describe an initiative of the National Center on Excellence in Homeless Services designed to use social work education as a mechanism to build local capacity for using SOAR.

Using a survey (EMSA2009) conducted by the French National Institute of Statistics (INSEE) and the French National Institute of Demography (INED) in January-February, 2009 in the city of Toulouse (France), we show that there is a continuum in the residential histories, in the current use of available resources and in the organization of daily life for part of the low income population, whether homeless or not, more precisely for the users of support services mostly meant for the homeless (except accommodation services, including hot meal distribution centers, and day and night centers) or who are contacted by outreach services. Besides, the EMSA2009 survey also shows that, in the French case, surveys associating time-location sampling and weightings based on the weight sharing method (Ardilly, Le Blanc, 2001) reach an important proportion of the rough sleepers (79 % when they are thus defined due to their usual housing situation, 92 % if due to their housing situation the night before the survey) through sampling in hot meal distribution centers. It also suggests other service sites which could help to study the rough sleepers who were not reached, according to the percentage of rough sleepers who use these services and do not use the hot meals distributions.

AB  - Despite the vast literature on shale energy development, surprisingly little empirical research has been conducted on the shale energy communicators, communication practices, and community outreach programs. Using data drawn from a random sample of individuals in two counties in the Eagle Ford Shale region of south Texas, we present a newly-constructed unidimensional scale that can be used to measure stakeholders' level of satisfaction with the oil and natural gas industry's communication performance. We then examine the relationship between individuals' level of communication satisfaction with the oil and gas industry and their perceptions of risk in regard to shale energy development in the Eagle Ford Shale. We find substantial support for the hypothesis that communication satisfaction with the oil and natural gas industry is negatively associated with risk perception. We conclude the paper with several suggestions for future research.

AB  - The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Cooperative Agreement program to reach out-of-treatment drug users and provide HIV prevention to reduce HIV drug and sexual risks was initiated in September of 1990. By August, 1994 the program included 23 sites which used various theoretical models to guide prevention strategies, to add conceptual coherence to many aspects of behavior change, and to allow for clearer interpretation of why behavior change occurs. This article reviews the theoretical models used at each of the NIDA Cooperative Agreement sites, the perceived helpfulness of the models, and recommendations for future initiatives.

AB  - The proposed research program will focus on developing and implementing theoretically derived sexual risk-reduction interventions targeting crack cocaine users who are not in drug treatment. The research will be conducted in two phases, a formative elicitation phase and an intervention evaluation phase. Phase 1 will begin with an exploratory investigation of sexual risk-reduction practices and contexts employing guided interview methodology with 45 participants. This will elicit preliminary information about the classes and contents of behavioral beliefs concerning positive and negative outcomes of practicing different sexual risk-reducing behaviors, barriers and facilitators to adoption of these behaviors, normative beliefs concerning the expectations and practices of significant others, social supports for sexual risk reduction, and influencing characteristics of personal social networks and cultural values. Based on this information, specific risk-reducing sexual behaviors will be identified for further study and potential intervention development, and a comprehensive interview instrument focused on these behaviors will be constructed and administered to a stratified sample of 240 target population members. The resulting data will be used to test an integrated theoretical intervention model and will inform the intervention development process by suggesting appropriate strategies for different individuals and behaviors. In Phase 2 of the research, multi-session behavior-change interventions addressing selected risk-reducing sexual practices in two targeted subpopulations and settings will be developed and evaluated in randomized experimental field studies. These interventions will be explicitly based on the proposed theoretical model of behavioral action and will be designed to maximize consistency of delivery and ease of replication. The effects of behavior-specific theory-linked interventions with HIV testing will be compared to the effects of a brief standardized prevention (control) strategy presented in the context of HIV testing. The specific intervention content and activities to be implemented will depend on Phase 1 findings. The first intervention will target male and female crack smokers accessed through street outreach (N = 825), and will build upon a successful intervention for out-of-treatment drug users developed under NIDA's Cooperative Agreement Program. This trial will investigate the benefits of providing activities and content tailored to individuals' readiness to change versus an intervention addressing all levels of personal readiness to change. The second intervention will target crack-using female sex workers (N = 240) and will utilize sex-worker networks to enhance participants' normative perceptions and provide social support for using condoms with both paying and main partners.

AB  - Background Many young people at high risk for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) are not reached by current sexual health care systems, such as general practitioners and public sexual health care centres (sexually transmitted infection clinics).Ct is the most frequently diagnosed bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) among sexually active people and in particular young heterosexuals. Innovative screening strategies are needed to interrupt the transmission of Ct among young people and connect the hidden cases to care. Methods Intervention Mapping (IM), a systematic approach to develop theory- and evidence-based interventions, was used to develop a strategy to target Ct testing towards young people who are currently hidden to care in The Netherlands. Both clinical users (i.e. sexual health care nurses) and public users (i.e., young people at risk for Ct) were closely involved in the IM process. A needs assessment study was carried out using semi-structured interviews among users (N = 21), a literature search and by taking lessons learned from existing screening programmes. Theoretical methods and practical applications to reach high risk young people and influence testing were selected and translated into specific programme components. Results The IM approach resulted in the development of a secure and web-based outreach Ct screening strategy, named SafeFriend. It is developed to target groups of high-risk young people who are currently hidden to care. Key methods include web-based Respondent Driven Sampling, starting from young Ct positive sexual health care centre clients, to reach and motivate peers (i.e., sex partners and friends) to get tested for Ct. Testing and the motivation of peers were proposed as the desired behavioural outcomes and the Precaution Adoption Process Model was chosen as theoretical framework. End users, i.e., young people and sexual health care nurses were interviewed and included in the development process to increase the success of implementation. Conclusions IM proved useful to develop an intervention for targeted Ct testing among young people. We believe this to be the first web-based outreach screening strategy which combines chain referral sampling with the delivery of targeted Ct testing to high risk young people within their sexual and social networks.

AB  - Introduction and Aims: Ethnic and cultural differences in vulnerability to drug-related harms have received little attention in Australia. The current study aimed to explore the influence of cultural beliefs and practices on vulnerability to blood-borne viral infections (BBVIs) among ethnic Vietnamese IDUs and to identify barriers to this group accessing health and preventive programmes. Design and Methods: Observational fieldwork and in-depth interviews (n = 58) were conducted in South Western Sydney. Participants were recruited using a mix of snowball and theoretical sampling strategies. Open coding was used to inductively classify data into themes and data examined for regularities and variations in relationships between and within themes. Results: Participants embraced pluralistic approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment, relying on co-existing layers of beliefs and utilising both traditional and western remedies. Four main cultural characteristics influenced vulnerability to BBVIs: trust and obligation, stoicism, the importance of ‘face’ and beliefs in fate. Other factors influencing injecting risk included low levels of knowledge, being in a state of withdrawal, availability of sterile injecting equipment and environmental constraints. Barriers to accessing services included stigma and discrimination, concerns in relation to confidentiality, long waiting times, resistance to pharmacotherapy treatment and language and financial barriers. Discussion and Conclusions: Results indicate a need for interventions based on culturally specific meanings and contexts of health, illness and risk. By understanding how culture impacts risk and protective behaviours among ethnic Vietnamese IDUs, clinicians and other service providers will be better equipped to meet the needs of this vulnerable group.

AB  - Besides having to cope with the usual pressures associated with the transition to adulthood, dropouts must deal with the stigma attached to the fact that they are school dropouts. Research reveals that, for a variety of socioeconomic and psychological reasons, dropouts are generally less able to plan, less willing to work hard, and less skilled in writing. Programs available for out-of-school youths range from those sponsored by community colleges and public schools to those offered by educational agencies in conjunction with employment and training programs. Three particularly noteworthy types of reentry programs for dropouts in adult settings are programs sponsored by technical schools, outreach programs, and continuing education high school programs. In general, successful programs for young adults reentering the educational system are sensitive to the stresses faced by young adults, possess a warm and flexible environment, provide a clear understanding of what teachers expect of students, offer individual counseling and curricula relevant to individual student needs, and offer students continuous constructive feedback.

AB  - The article focuses on the San Francisco's Department of Public Works' utilization of Envista, the data-gathering and reporting tool from Envista Corp. The new tool enables managers at 30 city agencies to coordinate. According to Dan McKenna, deputy bureau manager for the department, the value of viewing all the digs that will take place over the next five years and letting the public see that too, is big. Rick Fiery, chief executive officer (CEO) of Envista, claims that San Francisco is the first large city to implement Envista.

AB  - THING LF. Nursing Inquiry 2005; 12: 184 –191 Risk bodies: rehabilitation of sports patients in the physiotherapy clinic This paper describes how body regimes are effectuated in the prevailing treatment strategy of physiotherapy. The process of self-mastering in the context of sports-related injuries is highlighted. Through a Foucauldian perspective on body regimes the aim is to shed light on the process of individualization and self-mastery in rehabilitation. The treatment of illness in the physiotherapy clinic does not characterize the patient as sick, and exempt the patient from daily duties and expectations. The empirical data include 17 qualitative illness narratives and several years of fieldwork observing patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in a physiotherapy clinic. The study demonstrates how the expectation that the patients be active and self-mastering permeates the total process of treatment. The individual responsibility for personal well-being is a recurrent phenomenon in public health services in general, and specifically prominent in the rehabilitation of sports injuries.

AB  - This document describes the Peer Assistance and Leadership (PAL) Program, a peer helping program developed by the Austin Independent School District in Austin, Texas. It explains how selected high school students are trained to work as peer facilitators with younger students either on their own campus or from feeder junior high or elementary schools. The basic goal of the PAL program is given as helping the younger students to have a more positive and productive school experience and to make more responsible and informed decisions. Activities in which PAL students participate are listed, including outreach programs in the communities which deal with teenage sexuality, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse. It is noted that PAL students provide younger students with individual and group peer support, discussion sessions, and tutorial assistance. The history of the PAL program since its beginning in 1980 is briefly reviewed, PAL student training is described, and results of evaluations of the PAL program are discussed which attest to its success. The role of the PAL Advisory Committee, a volunteer organization of outstanding former PAL students, is discussed and future uses of PAL as a model program are considered. (NB)

AB  - In India men who have sex with men (MSM) are stigmatized, understudied, and at high risk for HIV. Understanding the impact of psychosocial issues on HIV risk behavior and HIV infection can help shape culturally relevant HIV prevention interventions. Peer outreach workers recruited 210 MSM in Chennai who completed an interviewer-administered psychosocial assessment battery and underwent HIV testing and counseling. More than one fifth (46/210) reported unprotected anal intercourse in the past 3 months, 8% tested positive for HIV, and 26% had previously participated in an HIV prevention intervention. In a multivariable logistic-regression model controlling for age, MSM subpopulation (kothi, panthi, or double-decker), marital status, and religion, significant predictors of any unprotected anal intercourse were being less educated (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = .54; p = .009), not having previously participated in an HIV prevention program (AOR = 3.75; p = .05), having clinically significant depression symptoms (AOR = 2.8; p = .02), and lower self-efficacy (AOR = .40; p < .0001). Significant predictors of testing positive for HIV infection were: being less educated (AOR = .53; .05) and not currently living with parent(s) (AOR = 3.71; p = .05). Given the prevalence of HIV among MSM, efforts to reach hidden subpopulations of MSM in India are still needed. Such programs for MSM in India may need to address culturally-relevant commonly co-occurring psychosocial problems to maximize chances of reducing risk for infection.

AB  - The Hanford Community Health Project (HCHP) addressed health concerns among "downwinders" exposed to releases of radioactive iodine (I-131) from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the 1940s and 1950s. After developing educational materials and conducting initial outreach, HCHP had to decide whether to apply its limited resources to an advertising or public relations approach. The decision to apply public relations strategies was effective in driving awareness of the risk communication message at the community level, reinvigorating the affected community, and ultimately increasing the number of people who sought information about their risk of exposure and related health issues. HCHP used a series of communication tools to reach out to local and regional media, medical and health professionals, and community organizations. The campaign was successful in increasing the number of unique visitors to HCHP Web site and educating and activating the medical community around the releases of I-131 and patient care choices.

AB  - In this paper we compare and contrast the view on poverty of lay people, who are affected by the policies, with that of academics and policy-makers. Drawing from fieldwork in a village in Kerala, India, and applying the 'participatory numbers' approach, we devise a 'local method' to identify poor households, based on the villagers' poverty criteria. The local method is then compared with the official methods used by the national and the state governments. Based on the results, we argue for the need to take into account local dimensions of poverty, in addition to objective/universal dimensions, in the design of poverty reduction programmes. Our findings also suggest that effective risk-mitigation strategies must be devised to help poor households cope with shocks and stresses as well as to prevent the vulnerable non-poor from falling into poverty.

AB  - This article explores effective approaches against racism in work with young people, and the relevance of new policy agendas in the UK. Since the 2001 disturbances, the UK has controversially prioritised 'Community Cohesion', with the accusation that this new direction represents the 'death of multiculturalism'. Drawing on empirical evidence from a project established to work with the racist views of White children in Leeds, and from youth work in Oldham, it explores how such work positively disrupts the public realm and re-thinks the previous framework of 'anti-racism'. It is suggested that anti-racist educational policies and practice have created a moral code which young people can either subscribe to or be punished by and that by failing to engage within a framework of inclusion and openness with young people who express racist views, educationalists risk alienating them from a positive recasting of those views. The article argues that the failure of past policies as one form of multiculturalism has promoted the alienation of those most in need of intervention regarding racism, and that 'Community Cohesion', as actually practiced at ground level, can offer a productive way forward to engage with racism within more intersectional understandings of youth identity and its formation.

AB  - Negative perceptions of homelessness contribute to deficit models of practice, false notions of homogeneity, and marginalization. Wellbeing is a state of satisfaction with material, social, and human aspects of life and can be measured both objectively and subjectively. The study explored the meaning and experience of wellbeing in the everyday lives of 20 homeless participants through fieldwork and interviews. This study revealed that health contributed little to their overall perception of wellbeing. Keeping safe, being positive and feeling good, connecting with others, and the ability to participate in “normal” life were the key contributors of subjective wellbeing. The authors demonstrate that social exclusion experienced in homelessness has a negative effect on subjective wellbeing. Services that provide opportunities to experience social inclusion and develop community and cultural connections will improve the wellbeing of homeless persons.

This book provides an in-depth analysis of the different groups of street youths who live in and around New York and the response of outreach services that aim to assist them. The book is based on a critical ethnographic study conducted by a feminist geographer and integrates both theoretical and practical perspectives of youth homelessness. This is a readable and sensitive account of how social, cultural and political structures influence the occupations of street kids and specifically addresses issues of mobility. The book focuses on how outreach practices intersect with the survival strategies employed by street kids, emphasising how political will and policing policies have pushed street kids out of public spaces and resulted in increased street kids’ mobility practices.

AB  - The South Bronx, an area of New York City that has traditionally needed a number of health care programs, tends to lag behind in service programs implemented. The purpose of this Capstone was to propose a program change for the Bronx Fatherhood Program. The ultimate goal of this program enhancement was the improvement in overall health knowledge, family engagement, financial sustainability, education experience, and mental health of families in the community of the South Bronx by introducing a program that services both parents and their children. The method utilized particular descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis of health care in the South Bronx to justify the need for this program enhancement. Some of the key information regarding health care disparities, that afflict the community of the South Bronx, was considered. The health disparities also highlighted the need for health improvements and innovative ways that various agencies and organizations have made healthcare more accessible for at risk populations. Under this new program, there was collaborative effort on the part of outreach staff, clinicians, and educators to provide coordinated health care. The program enhancement required additional staffing to provide necessary services. Quality of care provided and improvements in measurable outcomes were determined through data collection and case management practices. The proposed program change expanded the existing program services from a traditionally male focused model to include the entire family unit as potential care recipients. This program design change made health care more accessible for a greater number of people in the community.

AB  - Outdoor fieldwork has been a long-standing pedagogy in the higher education sector, across a range of disciplines. Based on a review of the literature, this paper explores the use of outdoor fieldwork in the 21st century university with particular reference to the way technology contributes to student learning. Research has indicated that fieldwork enhances student engagement, links theory and practice, and assists students with the development of professional expertise. Many of the challenges for outdoor fieldwork, such as budget cuts, risk management concerns, and workload demands on staff, have been exacerbated by massification pressures in universities, such as the growth in student numbers and a more diverse student cohort. The increased use of technology on outdoor field trips both solves and creates problems, and technology use in outdoor education has been described as a double-edged sword (Cuthbertson, Socha, & Potter, 2004). It can be difficult for teachers to judge whether the benefits to student-learning outcomes created by introducing technology outweigh any negative impacts. Koehler and Mishra's (2009) concept of technological pedagogical content knowledge suggests that teachers need to develop a very specific kind of knowledge to make informed decisions about the use of technology. The substitution, augmentation, modification, redefinition (SAMR) ladder (Puentedura, 2006) can contribute to this teacher knowledge by focusing on how the use of technology can transform student learning rather than just replace, or augment, existing teaching tools and strategies. Some examples of how technology is used at the different levels of the SAMR model in outdoor education are provided.

AB  - Drug-using women with or at risk for HIV infection have many competing unmet needs, especially for social services, drug treatment, and medical care. High-risk drug-using women were recruited through street outreach, at needle exchange sites, a prison, and local community based organizations in New Haven, Connecticut for a study of the service needs of out-of-treatment drug users and the ability of an interactive case management intervention (ICM) to address those needs. These women were administered baseline and follow-up interviews to identify their health and social service needs and the degree to which these needs were resolved. The women who chose to enroll in the interactive case management intervention (n = 38) did not differ demographically nor in their HIV risk behaviors from those not receiving case management (n = 73). Provision of ICM was most successful in meeting needs for supportive mental health counseling, basic services, and long term housing. The impact of interactive case management was less evident for the acquisition of medical and dental services, which were accessed comparably by women not receiving the intervention. Overall, the women who enrolled in the ICM intervention showed a significant decrease in the number of unmet service needs as compared to those who did not enroll. Multiple contacts were required by the case manager to establish trust and to resolve the unmet service needs of these high-risk women. Women with or at risk for HIV infection can be effectively engaged in an ICM intervention in order to meet their multiple unmet service needs, although such interventions are time-and labor intensive.

AB  - In an effort to find better and/or easier ways to select, train, and supervise youthworkers, this study examines the question, 'What is detached youthwork and how is it practiced?' Following a literature review, the methodology of this qualitative study is described. Using sixteen steps, the study was designed to implement a phenomenological psychological approach grounded in theory and method. Results indicate that being a detached youthworker means living in a way that is 'real,' 'authentic,' and filled with paradoxes and moral dilemmas. A complex set of values, beliefs and attitudes come into play not only during the time on duty but in all parts of youthworkers' lives at all times. Youthworkers focus on moving from 'what is' to 'what could be.' Poorly defined (common) practice, no career path, and an unclear mission characterize detached youthwork. Implications and recommendations are provided along with examples of a structured interview, a consent form, and a sample interview. Seventeen analytic themes are listed along with a reproduction of one theme: what is a youthwork stance? (MEG)

AB  - Due to their histories of caregiver maltreatment, living instability, and potential attachment challenges associated with out-of-home care, older foster youth represent a particularly vulnerable group of adolescents at increased risk for a number of poor well-being outcomes. However, research supports the notion that a relationship with a competent, caring adult, such as a mentor, may serve protectively for vulnerable youth, and a nascent yet growing body of literature suggests that naturally occurring mentoring relationships from within youth's social networks are associated with improved outcomes among young people in foster care during adolescence and the transition to adulthood. This systematic review is the first to comprehensively identify, synthesize, and summarize what we currently know from nearly a decade of theories, concepts, and research findings pertaining to natural mentoring among adolescent youth in foster care. A bibliographic search of seven databases and personal outreach to mentoring researchers and practitioners through a national listserv yielded 38 English-language documents from academic sources and the gray literature pertaining to natural mentoring among older foster youth. We identified quantitative studies that have been conducted to test the theories and hypotheses that have emerged from the qualitative studies of natural mentoring among youth in foster care. Together, this literature suggests that natural mentoring is a promising practice for youth in foster care. Based on our findings from the systematic review, we make practice recommendations to encourage the facilitation of natural mentoring within child welfare contexts and outline an agenda for future research that more rigorously investigates natural mentoring among older youth in foster care.

AB  - Abstract Nearly 3 out of 4 all lifelong mental disorders occur by the age of twenty-four. Remote crisis support holds great potential in filling a critical gap in complementing and expanding access to mental health services for acute episodes of mental distress in adolescents and young adults; yet little is understood about the individual factors that influence help-seeking behavior in this group. Recent evidence suggests technology-based mental health services have high acceptability among youth and may be used to treat anxiety and depression. The objective of this study was to examine county-level help-seeking behavior among adolescents and young adults using Crisis Text Line (CTL). CTL is a free, text-based crisis counseling service that has been available nationally since 2013. Spatial error regression was used to (1) identify the individual-level factors that correlate with help-seeking behavior for depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and (2) to explore the geographic trends in text-based help-seeking behavior between adolescents and young adults across the rural-urban continuum. Increased rates of text-based help-seeking occurred in counties with higher mean household incomes, higher divorce rates, and lower residential stability. Rurality was the strongest predictor for low rates of help-seeking, and this finding is particularly concerning in light of elevated rates of suicide among rural counties. Rural communities, particularly those with low support-seeking behavior and comparatively high suicide rates, should be the target of future research and outreach. Highlights • Text-based crisis support offers new mental health intervention platforms. • Crisis Text Line (CTL) offers new insight into adolescent help-seeking behavior. • County-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics predict CTL use. • Rural populations are slow to adopt CTL, despite high suicide rates.

AB  - Conceptually, many energy poverty studies to date have been narrowly focused on inadequate indoor heating, paying little attention to other domestic energy services. Yet there are indications that a growing number of households in Europe are struggling to achieve adequate levels of indoor cooling, with adverse consequences for their health, well-being and productivity. This situation is exacerbated by changing global weather patterns, with many countries facing increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme heatwaves. There is limited understanding of the ways in which households respond to extreme heat, and consequently how this might create greater demand for indoor space cooling and air conditioning, and the consequences for increased stress on power grids and conflicts with carbon reduction goals. Using custom-built survey data collected from 2337 households in Gdańsk (Poland), Prague (Czech Republic), Budapest (Hungary) and Skopje (North Macedonia), along with in-depth qualitative fieldwork with 55 households in the same cities, this paper presents novel evidence on the issue of summertime energy poverty and space cooling difficulties. We identify the driving forces of household vulnerability to excessive indoor heat, in terms of risk of exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity, and explore the implications for addressing energy poverty.

AB  - The purchasing of sexual services by adults from children and adolescents affects an unknown proportion of New Zealand youth, and is present in both rural and urban settings. International research shows that on average girls begin using sex for survival between the ages of 12 and 15. It can be argued that the terms used to denote adolescent transactional sex indicate the researchers' moral position of the subject; the terms 'prostitution' and 'client' suggesting equal bargaining power and the terms 'criminality' and 'delinquency' implying victim responsibility. Recent articles are consistent in their comparison of transactional sex to child sexual abuse. Patriarchal ideals relating to gender roles and female sexuality may perpetuate the selling of sexual services by young people. Three primary pathways into survival sex have been identified: through intermediaries, through child sexual abuse and through inadequate protective systems. Children and young people engaged in transactional sex experience a range of adverse effects related to physical, sexual and mental health, and relationships. In New Zealand the use of children under 18 for sexual services is explicitly prohibited, but there are no comprehensive, nation-wide services for victims of transactional sex. Recommendations from the literature support a multi-systemic approach, with an extension of street outreach services, welfare provision and targeted prevention strategies.

AB  - Teams at several universities collaborated in studies of the Causes and Correlates of Delinquency program in three cities. This bulletin presents the findings from the Rochester (New York) Youth Development Study (RYDS) concerning the contributions of youth gang membership to delinquency. The RYDS started with a sample of 1,000 boys and girls in the 7th and 8th grades of the Rochester public schools. The sample included more youth from high-crime areas and fewer from low-crime areas. About 30% of the youth in the study reported being a member of a street gang at some point. Results clearly indicate that gang members were responsible for most of the delinquent acts reported. Although gang members were only one-third of the RYDS respondents, they were responsible for 86% of the serious delinquent acts, 69% of the violent acts, and 70% of the drug sales. These findings underline the importance of establishing effective intervention programs for gang-involved youth. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) implemented a comprehensive response to gangs in 1994, with initiatives that include the identification of promising programs to reduce gang involvement. The Boys & Girls Clubs of America's Gang Prevention through Targeted Outreach program is an example of a gang reduction effort that is succeeding by recruiting youth into youth clubs in a nonstigmatizing way. Building its programs on a solid base of empirical research enables the OJJDP to plan multifaceted responses to youth gangs. (Contains 10 references.) (SLD)

AB  - This research project conducts ethnographic interviews with West Indian families in the natural environment of their homes to discover the cultural distinctions, particularly as it relates to the parent-child relationship. West Indians are those Blacks who were born in one of the English-speaking Caribbean Islands and subsequently immigrated to the United States. The geographical area of the fieldwork is Brooklyn, the borough with the largest population of West Indians. The informants of the ethnographic interviews were self-selected from a pilot study of past or present recipients of a Prevention Program mandated to prevent the abuse and neglect of children and the placement of them in foster care. The research design of ethnography follows a cultural anthropological approach of language decoding and analysis based on descriptions by the informants. A major theme of West Indian culture is the extended family play a major role in the the child-rearing and socialization of children. Although the immigration process has caused the separation of biological parents and children over prolonged periods, there continues to be a closeness, sharing, and commitment to the family unit of extended relatives which is maintained across geographical boundaries. Another emerging theme in the culture is the importance of a spiritual and religious experience whether that is expressed formally through church membership and rituals or informally. Respect is a dominant core symbol defining the relationship between parent and child in establishing roles and appropriate boundaries for child-rearing practices. The technique of disciplining by the use of physical punishment is a theme that has emerged as a culturally sanctioned value and an appropriate child rearing practice. However, this practice has resulted in conflict with the dominant culture where the hitting may be viewed as child abuse. Education has emerged as highly valued for the families in achieving their migration goals and for upward mobility in the United States. However, the children are experiencing a range of problems in the educational setting which has made this goal elusive for them. The themes formed the base for the workshop in understanding West Indians and the implications for practice.

AB  - Introduction: Almost forty percent of all Indigenous Queenslanders are younger than fifteen years of age. It is well known that Indigenous children and young people experience higher rates of mental illness within their developmental years from stressors such as discrimination, loss of language, social dislocation, isolation, violence, grief and loss. Indigenous young people also experience higher rates of substance misuse, lower school retention rates, higher rates of incarceration, over-representation in child protection, living below the poverty line and higher rates of suicidality and deaths by suicide. Many Indigenous children and young people do not access or refuse entry to mainstream mental health services due to the negative judgement, dismissal of rights to care, non-attendance and past historical dogma and discrimination. This study investigates key care components to support the engagement of Indigenous children, young people and their families in the community. It aims to increase the transparency of the outreach model, highlight barriers in achieving the expected level of performance and will emphasise the need to work inclusively with the local indigenous population and collaboratively across government and non-government sectors. Methods: To better understand and to articulate a culturally appropriate outreach model, a time and motion study was conducted. This study is critical in observing and understanding the real time activity (consumer related and non-consumer related) of a community based indigenous outreach worker and to identify the obstacles in recording services provided. Results: The experiential information collation phase conducted two days per week, for a duration of three months was inclusive of indigenous child and youth who met the criteria for mental health referral and had an indigenous background, although not all persons were open to the service (N=120). Categories to support care needs included provisions of service on health procedures, system navigation, interventions, case management, referral pathways and other advocacy and support services. Discussions and conclusions: The activities of the indigenous outreach worker are at times difficult to capture, with many not being able to be recorded within current systems. However, it was deemed that these activities form the foundation of continued engagement - without undertaking such activities young people and families do not engage and therefore the opportunity to impact on the health and wellbeing of young people are lost. We need to continue to work with system administrators as we continue to focus on further developing our partnership models within local communities to decrease the disparity for indigenous children and youth is essential. Meeting the needs of the Indigenous population requires time to develop authentic relationships and community acceptance, communicate across sectors, broaden the traditional models of care and address barriers that prevent providers from engaging in cultural informed practices. While there remains challenges in capturing the activities, the innovative outreach model developed is seen as holding considerable promise for implementation in other areas and in improving the outcomes for Indigenous children, young people and families across the spectrum of mental health care.

AB  - Although the incidence of unexpected cardiac or respiratory arrest in children's hospitals is small at 0.19 to 2.45 per 1000 admissions {[}1-4] compared with 2.6 to 6.5 per 1000 admissions in adult hospitals {[}5-8], prevention is worthwhile given that the outcome of pediatric cardiorespiratory arrest ill hospital remains poor {[}9-11]. In a meta-analysis of reports of outcomes of pediatric cardiac arrest {[}9], only 24% of 544 children were able to be discharged from hospital after cardiac arrest, and in a North American study {[}10] involving 156 hospitals, only 27% of 880 children survived to hospital discharge; of these 34% had poor neurologic Function. Although adult cardiac arrest has been historically considered a sudden event, it is now recognized that cardiac arrest in hospitalized adults is often preceded by a period of recognizable prodromes, or sets of symptoms and signs, that Suggest physiologic deterioration {[}12-19]. Similarly, although cardiac arrest in hospitalized infants and children may occur suddenly seeondary to all acute cardiac, respiratory, or neurologic event, Such as all arrhythmia, blocked tracheostomy tube, or seizure, more commonly it is attributable to a gradual progression of hypoxemia and hemodynarnic instability arising from various illnesses. Given that signs and symptoms of physiologic instability often exist for a period before cardiac or respiratory arrest, it is sensible to educate general inpatient unit staff to recognize these signs and symptoms and then mobilize experienced personnel from other areas of the hospital, often from the intensive care unit {[}20], who have the knowledge, skills, experience, confidence, and equipment to intervene and prevent deterioration toward cardiac arrest and death. This philosophy has driven interest ill the development of various rapid response systems. Around the world these systems have various names and compositions: medical emergency teams (METs) composed of doctors and nurses, rapid response teams (RRTs) composed of either doctors and nurses or nurses alone, critical care outreach teams (CCOTs) composed of nurses alone with rapid access to physician assistance {[}21], and patient at risk teams (PARTs). METs and RRTs may also manage cardiac arrest in a single-tier response system or they may function independently in addition to a conventional cardiac arrest ({''}code{''}) team. Death from foreseeable cardiac arrest is a potentially preventable adverse event. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement in the United States recommended implementation of rapid response teams as one of six strategies to decrease by 100,000 the number of preventable inpatient deaths between December 2004 and June 2006 {[}22]. Although aggressively implemented in both adult and children's hospitals with early promising results, it is not unequivocally clear if this strategy by itself consistently reduces unexpected deaths. The benefits may be significant. however. It was claimed that if results from an MET service from one Australian adult hospital {[}7,23] were applied nationally in that Country, 6000 adult hospital deaths per annum Could be prevented {[}24]. The outcomes Of the Most Current and best scientific Studies of adult and pediatric rapid response systems are Outlined in the next sections.

AB  - My dissertation is based on two and a half years of ethnographic fieldwork into how fears of youth and fears for youth have transformed politics and urban spaces in Oakland California. I examine a series of political mobilizations to define the needs and problems of youth in Oakland, and I argue that representations of youth as dangerous and endangered have had deep material effects, shaping the physical spaces in which youth live and the form of the state. I argue that recent political and economic transformations have disrupted the security of key cultural categories like childhood, youth and adulthood and prompted a wide range of political mobilizations to secure the increasingly problematic boundaries of these categories. I examine the ways parents, neighborhood activists, youth activists and professional service providers have worked to secure the path between childhood and adulthood through community policing, after-school programs and restructured juvenile justice policies. I analyze how these mobilizations are shaped both by Oakland's complex social geography and by the fragmented structure of the local state. These diverse political mobilizations in Oakland have argued for very different roles of the state and in the process have shaped the process of state transformation. By examining the diverse and often contradictory social mobilizations to reform youth and secure the path from childhood to adulthood, we can see the contested process by which the state is being restructured in late capitalism. As activists defined youth crime as either a private problem caused by problematic families or a public problem caused by state failures, they mobilized to secure very different forms of state action. While I emphasize the ways contemporary state transformations emerge out of social struggles, I also highlight the significant ideological power of the state both in shaping our understandings of youth and in structuring the possibilities for political action. I develop a model for understanding links between changes in cultural categories like childhood or youth, economic transformations and changes in the form of the state.

AB  - Psychiatric work with homeless people has generated a particular style of service. It involves elements of assertive outreach assessment, case management, assertive treatment, and close relationships with the voluntary sector. This activity has thrown up a number of practical and ethical dilemmas. Some of these are generated by the relationship between the patient and the practitioner, others are generated by the relationship between practitioners and the wider service network within which they work. These problems include the conflicting principles of paternalism and autonomy, the boundaries of medical confidentiality and the limitations of the Mental Health Act. Although this work is highly specialised, it includes most of the essential activities of urban community psychiatry, and so the instances described have a wider relevance to community psychiatry as a whole.

AB  - Comments on an article by M. Hayward (see record [rid]2007-13622-002[/rid]). The commentators are encouraged to see that at least one trainee has pursued an active interest in homelessness/shelter populations. However, they would like to throw further light on one of the author's conclusions. Stating that training is needed for shelter staff implies that there is little or no training available. In fact, a program of training for voluntary sector organisations involved in homelessness was set up in London about 12 years ago. One of the limiting factors in training CRISIS volunteers is the lack of time and their large numbers. However, most homeless people who attend a CRISIS shelter will be in touch for the rest of the year with one of the other organisations we offer training to, whether it be a hostel, a day centre or a street outreach team. It may well prove more cost-effective to focus on those working permanently with homeless people as their daily experience is likely to 'cement' what they have learnt in their training.

AB  - Favorable drug treatment outcomes are predicted by such factors as continuing in treatment, adherence to treatment regimens, and engagement in therapeutic processes. In turn, these factors are related in complex ways to the capability of treatment providers and the availability of resources; to patient factors such as motivation, suitability for treatment, and medical and psychological problems; and to external environmental events and influences. Innovative drug treatment approaches are described that attempt to build on a wide range of theoretical and clinical work to improve understanding of the treatment process and treatment outcomes. These approaches include outreach and enrolling high-risk populations in treatment, providing comprehensive treatment to those who need it, providing comprehensive AIDS education and behavioral change counseling, providing social skills and relapse prevention training, developing and testing improved counseling strategies, implementing and testing case management approaches, integrating treatment modalities, varying planned length of treatment, and providing continuity of care and transitional services in the criminal justice setting. Improved access to drug treatment is discussed in the context of methadone maintenance, residential treatment, case management, and multimodal and other eclectic programs. Specific attention is paid to HIV risk among injection drug users, cocaine addiction, cognitive and behavioral enhancements to community-based drug treatment, and the effect of treatment on high-risk sexual behavior and drug use.

Current approaches to reducing maternal mortality in Zimbabwe focus on the pregnancy period with antenatal care, obstetric care, and micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy. Although important, these approaches are not reaching a large number of women and may benefit from integration with pre-pregnancy approaches. The importance of pre-pregnancy interventions to promote young women's health has been emphasized, yet many young women in developing countries like Zimbabwe do not have access to pre-pregnancy care because little is understood about the concept of pre-pregnancy planning. Furthermore, it is unknown which interventions will have the greatest impact on maternal outcomes of women in these countries. The purpose of this research was to work collaboratively with adolescent girls, young women, and key stakeholders in Harare, Zimbabwe to bridge the knowledge gap around pre-pregnancy planning and to inform the development of a pre-pregnancy planning intervention. Interview data were collected from June-August 2015 from adolescent girls and young women (14--24 years) (n=48) and key community stakeholders (n=24) from two low-income high-density communities in Harare. Sixteen focus groups were also conducted in November 2015 with females aged 14--24 years, healthcare workers, and partners of females aged 14--24 years (n=134). Qualitative analysis with Nvivo 10 software indicated that adolescent girls and young women conceptualized pregnancy across 8 themes: carrying a child, motherhood, the best time for pregnancy, pregnancy decision makers, who is responsible for the pregnancy, pregnancy burden, pregnancy dangers, and increase in social status with pregnancy. Participants expressed mixed views concerning the possibility of planning a pregnancy and described pregnancy planning across the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and post-pregnancy phases. Key community stakeholders described a physical environment related to pregnancy and planning for pregnancy that was limited in programming targeting adolescent girls and young women and a social environment that was deeply rooted in culture and cultural practices. Focus group participants described potential pre-pregnancy efforts that included clinic programs, community outreach, edutainment, empowerment of young women, parent and partner involved or targeted programs, peer education, school programs, technology programs, and youth friendly environments. Findings suggest that considering the socio-sociocultural influences on pregnancy will be beneficial in developing pre-pregnancy efforts to improve maternal and child health in Zimbabwe.

AB  - Timely entry into HIV care post-diagnosis has a number of benefits, including decreased morbidity, mortality, and infectiousness, as well as exposure to secondary prevention through clinical interventions. Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) may face even greater challenges in getting the treatment they need, due to limited employment, poverty, lack of insurance, and HIV and sexual minority stigmas. The specific goals of the Special Project of National Significance (SPNS) YMSM of color initiative were three-fold: (1) to conduct outreach to assist seropositive individuals learn their HIV status; (2) to link HIV-infected persons with medical care; and (3) to prevent transmission of HIV infection from targeted clients. In this special supplemental issue of AIDS Patient Care and STDs, the SPNS YMSM of Color Initiative Study Group presents its findings to further the understanding of the YMSM of color population and the unique challenges faced by the participants.

AB  - Evaluated the success of 12 integrated service HIV Outreach Demonstration Projects funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, in terms of the effects of project- and client-level factors on persuading at-risk clients to obtain HIV tests and facilitating entry by substance-abusing clients into structured substance abuse treatment. The cross-site study was based on data for 9,296 clients (mean age 35 yrs), who were injection drug users and their sex- and needle-sharing partners. Client-level variables included use of crack cocaine or marijuana, unprotected sex, sexual partner of drug user, and HIV risk education. Project variables were on-site HIV testing, mobile units, and gender focus. Results of hierarchical linear modeling analysis support the hypothesis that HIV Outreach, as an integrated approach to addressing the multiple problems clients have due to substance abuse and related problems, can be an effective model for reaching clients who have not been reached through traditional means. By implementing comprehensive HIV Outreach interventions, many of the HIV Outreach projects were successful in addressing the needs of their clients. However, some services and service delivery procedures were more effective than others in achieving project objectives. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The current global refugee crisis requires attention from the public health community to improve the health and wellbeing of forcibly displaced groups. Eighty-six percent of refugees are hosted in developing countries, while 58% migrate to urban centers in search of opportunities. Although there are benefits to urban migration, refugees residing in Nairobi, Kenya are vulnerable to police extortion, arrests, deportations, and social exclusion as a result of anti-refugee policies. Despite threats to psychosocial wellbeing, many refugees successfully cope with acute and cumulative stressors to exhibit positive mental health outcomes in the context of adversity. This dissertation explores the ways urban Congolese refugees in Nairobi negotiate and navigate personal, social, and environmental resources to mitigate stress and promote psychosocial wellbeing. Research Aims: The dissertation included the following three aims: (1) document stressors experienced by urban Congolese refugees in Nairobi; (2) describe the range of coping supports available to Congolese refugees; identify how individuals, families, and groups navigate and negotiate these resources; and (3) explore relationships that exist among stressors, supportive resources, and reported mental health status of urban Congolese refugees. Methods: Mixed-methods exploratory research took place over a 12-month period in Nairobi. Preliminary research was conducted between May and August 2012, and dissertation fieldwork occurred between January and August 2014. Qualitative research included ethnographic participant observation, semi-structured in-depth interviews, and small group discussions with Congolese refugees (n=70). Additional interviews were conducted in Kenya with academics (n=3), intergovernmental employees (n=4), representatives from government agencies (n=2), and refugee service providers (n=18). Quantitative research was comprised of two surveys administered to Congolese refugees (N=244) in 150 households. The Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) assessed mental health functioning, and a survey developed in-field inventoried perceived stressors and supports. Results: The results by aim were: (1) stressors fell within three primary domains: inadequate material resources, political and personal insecurity, and emotional distress; (2) Congolese refugees utilized three salient coping strategies, comprised of reliance on religious communities and faith in God, participation in borrowing networks, and managing memories; and (3) isolation was associated with poor mental health functioning, while perceived support from religious communities enhanced mental health outcomes. Recommendations: Organizations should bolster community-based programs and strengthen partnerships with religious communities to improve the psychosocial wellbeing of urban Congolese refugees. Conclusions: Shifting the paradigm with refugee populations from a deficits-centric to resilience-focused framework recognizes the inherent strengths of individuals, families and communities with refugee status, and has the potential to mold future research and praxis that aims to enhance the wellbeing of displaced populations.

AB  - Describes the development of an outreach mental health service for homeless children and families, and presents the referral characteristics and management of 40 families. The families were homeless predominantly because of domestic and neighbourhood violence. They were usually referred to the team for assessment of parents and children, without specific mental health concerns. A range of mental health interventions was offered, as well as liaison with other agencies. The development of such services requires coordination of different agencies working with children and their parents. Also, development of designated staff and resources are required because of the potential conflict with generic services. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper presents findings of a user perspective study on the impact of ICTs (information and communications technology) in rural India. The study is based on primary research conducted by the author in Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The aim of the primary research is to explore whether ICTs can be deployed to enable the improvement of rural human capital and increase participation in market opportunities. Amidst growing literature on the supply-side debates on ICTs in the rural sector, this study addresses the sparsely explored demand-side factors. Further, the outcomes of the fieldwork challenge and validate the 'ICT-rural poverty linkages' conceptual framework for ICT growth to be good for poverty, developed by the author in an earlier publication (2006). The paper further identifies issues critical to enhancing the accessibility of ICT services to the poorest rural households.

AB  - SEVERAL FACTORS--JUVENILE CRIME, THE BELIEF THAT YOUTHS ARE A COMMUNITY'S MOST IMPORTANT LEGACY, THE DESIRE TO PREVENT YOUTHS FROM TURNING TO A LIFE OF CRIME, REALIZATION OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH ADOLESCENCE--ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR SPECIAL POLICE YOUTH OFFICERS AND BUREAUS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK, THESE BUREAUS ARE LIKELY TO BE SEPARATE FROM DETECTIVE BUREAUS. YOUTH BUREAUS WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH JUVENILES' PERSONAL AND SOCIAL CONCERNS AS WELL AS THEIR ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR, AND INCREASING EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED ON THE GUIDANCE CONCEPT IN POLICE YOUTH WORK. YOUTH OFFICERS WILL BE CHOSEN ON THE BASIS OF THEIR DESIRE TO WORK WITH YOUTH AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT QUALIFY THEM FOR SUCH WORK. SPECIAL SELECTION CRITERIA WILL INCLUDE ACADEMIC BACKGROUND, RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PEOPLE IN THE HELPING PROFESSIONS, PERSONAL INTERVIEWS, PERSONALITY TEST SCORES, AND PROBATIONARY PERFORMANCE. YOUTH OFFICERS WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO PURSUE ADVANCED DEGREES IN THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, AND SPECIAL CERTIFICATION MAY BE REQUIRED FOR OFFICERS WHO ENGAGE IN YOUTH WORK. INCREASING NUMBERS OF WOMEN AND PART-TIME ASSISTANTS WILL STAFF YOUTH BUREAUS, AND THE POSITION OF YOUTH OFFICER WILL BECOME A FULL-TIME CAREER SPECIALTY. YOUTH BUREAU ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY EFFICIENT AND PROFESSIONAL, AND DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES MORE SOPHISTICATED. NEW RECORDKEEPING POLICIES AND SYSTEMS WILL EMERGE. OTHER TRENDS INCLUDE GROWING DEPENDENCE ON COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS FOR SUPPORT, TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT OF ALL OFFICERS TO YOUTH BUREAUS AS PART OF THEIR TRAINING, GROWING RECOGNITION OF EXTERNAL INFLUENCES ON THE ROLE OF THE YOUTH OFFICER, ASSUMPTION BY YOUTH OFFICERS OF INITIATIVE AND LEADERSHIP IN DETERMINING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES, AND REEVALUATION OF THE PHYSCIAL ENVIRONMENT OF YOUTH BUREAUS (FURNISHINGS, COLORS, ETC.).

AB  - Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) experience persistently high rates of undiagnosed HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and testing rates remain sub-optimal. Home-based testing (HBT) has been found to be acceptable among MSM and while awareness about HBT is relatively high, uptake has been low. Peer-based approaches have been shown to be effective in reducing HIV risk behavior, yet have not been used to increase utilization of HBT. The purpose of this study was to assess acceptability and feasibility of a program to train YBMSM as Peer Mentors to use and promote HIV and STI home-based testing and specimen collection to their social network members. Fifteen YBMSM ages 18-30 completed in-depth structured interviews and were asked to talk with their social network members about home-based testing. Participants reported acceptability of the Peer Mentor role and two-thirds had conversations with diverse social network members (e.g., male and female, sex partners, friends, family). Facilitators of peer outreach included the novelty of home-based testing, confidence about accuracy of the tests, and resources for linkage to care. Barriers included concerns about negative responses and disclosure of sexual identity/behavior. Results of this study suggest that YBMSM are willing and able to promote HBT to their social networks. This is a promising approach to increasing dissemination of HBT kits for both HIV and STI testing.

AB  - Introduction: Equitable access to health care is a key health systems goal, and is a particular concern in low-income countries. In Kenya, public facilities are an important resource for the poor, but little is known on the equity of service provision. This paper assesses whether poorer areas have poorer health services by investigating associations between public facility characteristics and the poverty level of the area in which the facility is located. Methods: Data on facility characteristics were collected from a nationally representative sample of public health centers and dispensaries across all 8 provinces in Kenya. A two-stage cluster randomized sampling process was used to select facilities. Univariate associations between facility characteristics and socioeconomic status (SES) of the area in which the facility was located were assessed using chi-squared tests, equity ratios and concentration indices. Indirectly standardized concentration indices were used to assess the influence of SES on facility inputs and service availability while controlling for facility type, province, and remoteness. Results: For most indicators, we found no indication of variation by SES. The clear exceptions were electricity and laboratory services which showed evidence of pro-rich inequalities, with equity ratios of 3.16 and 3.43, concentration indices of 0.09 (p<0.01) and 0.05 (p=0.01), and indirectly standardized concentration ratios of 0.07 (p<0.01) and 0.05 (p=0.01). There were also some indications of pro-rich inequalities for availability of drugs and qualified staff. The lack of evidence of inequality for other indicators does not imply that availability of inputs and services was invariably high; for example, while availability was close to 90% for water supply and family planning services, under half of facilities offered delivery services or outreach. Conclusions: The paper shows how local area poverty data can be combined with national health facility surveys, providing a tool for policy makers to assess the equity of input and service availability. There was little evidence of inequalities for most inputs and services, with the clear exceptions of electricity and laboratory services. However, efforts are required to improve the availability of key inputs and services across public facilities in all areas, regardless of SES.

AB  - The futures study included an extensive literature review and site visits to mid-size police departments with anti-gang programs. Additionally, a group forecasting process identified five trends and events that underscore the severity of illegal gang activities and the problems they are causing mid-size police departments. The report recommends a comprehensive, cooperative strategy that involves law enforcement, other components of the criminal justice system, local government, the schools, and a variety of community resources. Elements of the plan include efforts to counter gangs as a top police priority, gang reporting and intelligence, 'zero tolerance' law enforcement, City Council commitment, graffiti abatement, police-school liaison, youth outreach programs, news media involvement, an areawide law enforcement task force, and interdisciplinary criminal justice coordination. A transition management plan is presented to facilitate the development of a police-led communitywide effort to counter gangs. 3 tables, appended supplementary material, and 16 references.

AB  - Clinical services for the early detection of individuals at clinical high risk of psychosis, such as Outreach and Support in South-London (OASIS), have been successful in providing psychological intervention and psychosocial support to young people experiencing emerging signs of serious mental disorders. Despite this, several studies have repeatedly shown that vocational and functional recovery in the clinical high risk for psychosis population is still low. This study aimed at evaluating the presence and nature of educational and employment focused interventions within the OASIS service, in order to inform research and clinical interventions aimed at supporting young people with early signs of psychosis on their path to vocational recovery. The specific objectives were to compare current practice i) to standards defined by the National Institute of Care Excellence guidelines; and ii) to principles defined by Individual Placement and Support (IPS). Nine standards of practice were derived. The OASIS caseload electronic records entered between January 2015 and January 2017 were manually screened. Data collected include sociodemographic, assessment of employment and educational status and support needs, interventions received, contacts with schools, employers and external vocational providers, employment, and educational status. Standards were considered as ``met{''} if they were met for at least 90% of clients. Results suggest that, two out of nine standards were met while the remaining standards were only partially met. In particular, support provided was always focused on competitive employment and mainstream education and support was always based on people's interest. Implications for clinical and research practice are discussed.

AB  - Historically, the Netherlands has hosted a large number of migrant sex workers. Since sex work is considered a legal profession it might serve as an example of better access to health services, including HIV testing, at least for those working within the legal framework. However, migrant sex workers, especially non-European Union (EU) nationals, might not be eligible to register for official employment and thus face obstacles in obtaining access to health services, becoming essentially invisible. This study examined context-specific vulnerabilities of migrant female sex workers (FSWs) from Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine, whether and how they have access to HIV testing compared to other EE, non-EU migrant FSWs in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. We conducted a multi-stakeholder perspective study from November 2015 to September 2017 in Amsterdam. The study comprised 1) semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (N = 19); 2) in-depth interviews with Eastern European, non-EU migrant FSWs (N = 5) and field observations of the escort agency working with them; and 3) in-depth interviews with key stakeholders (N = 12). We found six key barriers to HIV testing: 1) migration and sex-work policies; 2) stigma, including self-stigmatization; 3) lack of trust in healthcare providers or social workers; 4) low levels of Dutch or English languages; 5) negative experience in accessing healthcare services in the home country; and 6) low perceived risk and HIV-related knowledge. Having a family and children, social support and working at the licensed sex-work venues might facilitate HIV testing. However, Internet-based sex workers remain invisible in the sex-work industry. Our findings indicate the importance of addressing women's diverse experiences, shaped by intrapersonal, interpersonal, community, network and policy-level factors, with stigma being at the core. We call for the scaling up of outreach interventions focusing on FSWs and, in particular, migrant FSWs working online.

AB  - This article describes a 22-week family intervention program, specifically designed to prevent antisocial behavior in urban, minority children. This program was developed as one component of the Metropolitan Area Child Study, a multiyear delinquency prevention field trial. A theoretical model for strengthening critical family processes related to the emergence of antisocial behavior is presented. In addition, specific intervention goals, modalities, and activities are described. Phases of the program include pre-engagement, joining and assessment, problem definition, intervention, and ending. Recommendations for the development, implementation, and evaluation of family-based prevention programs are highlighted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Use of preventive health care exams for women such as Pap smear screening are linked to factors like socioeconomic status, knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of the users, and availability and accessibility of services. Various studies confirm the direct relationship between these variables and Pap smear screening. This study investigated the relationships between social and other characteristics and screening behavior with the goal to identify factors associated with women who do not get screened. The fieldwork occurred from September 1996 to March 1997 in a poor urban district in the metropolitan area of Salvador in Bahia, Brazil. A cross-sectional community-based survey utilized a cluster-sampling technique to collect information from 275 women 20–49 years of age. The two subgroups of women established for the data analysis were screeners and non-screeners. This study scrutinized the Anderson and Aday model of health care utilization. A majority of the respondent's (216) had a Pap smear in the past three years. A profile of the non-screeners (59) showed they were older, single, had less than minimum wage, and unskilled workers. Non-screeners reported greater general stress than screeners did but these variables were not statistically significant. Behavioral characteristics established that non-screeners started sexual activity at an earlier age (10–15 years old), reported frequent pregnancies (10–12), and were smokers. The main predictors of non-screening in the multivariate analysis were never attended school, lack of knowledge about cervical cancer issues, and no reported gynecology visit. These findings generally affirm the importance of understanding the women's utilization pattern and compliance with Pap smear screening. The absence of a gynecology visit was a strong predictor of non-screening in the multivariate analysis exemplifying the importance and limitation of this service. Lack of knowledge of cervical cancer issues points to possible targets to improve screening practices. Overall these results prove that it is possible to identify underscreeners; and implement appropriate methods to increase recruitment.

AB  - Background: Since 1990, the lives of 48 million children under the age of 5 years have been saved because of increased investments in reducing child mortality. However, despite these unprecedented gains, 250 million children younger than 5 years in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) cannot meet their developmental potential due to poverty, poor health and nutrition, and lack of necessary stimulation and care. Lesotho has high levels of poverty, HIV, and malnutrition, all of which affect child development outcomes. There is a unique opportunity to address these complex issues through the widespread network of informal preschools in rural villages in the country, which provide a setting for inclusive, integrated Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) and HIV and nutrition interventions. Methods: We are conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial in Mokhotlong district, Lesotho, to evaluate a newly developed community-based intervention program to integrate HIV-testing and treatment services, ECCD, and nutrition education for caregivers with children aged 1-5 years living in rural villages. Caregivers and their children are randomly assigned by village to intervention or control condition. We select, train, and supervise community health workers recruited to implement the intervention, which consists of nine group-based sessions with caregivers and children over 12 weeks (eight weekly sessions, and a ninth top-up session 1 month later), followed by a locally hosted community health outreach day event. Group-based sessions focus on using early dialogic book-sharing to promote cognitive development and caregiver-child interaction, health-related messages, including motivation for HIV-testing and treatment uptake for young children, and locally appropriate nutrition education. All children aged 1-5 years and their primary caregivers living in study villages are eligible for participation. Caregivers and their children will be interviewed and assessed at baseline, after completion of the intervention, and 12 months post intervention. Discussion: This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the potential of an integrated early childhood development intervention to prevent or mitigate developmental delays in children living in a context of extreme poverty and high HIV rates in rural Lesotho. This paper presents the intervention content and research protocol for the study.

AB  - Homeless HIV+ persons with persistent mental illness and substance use disorders need services, but are hard to reach and enrol into treatment. Connecting them to services is a major challenge of the AIDS epidemic. This report describes characteristics of homeless HIV+ substance abusers who responded to outreach and enrolled in integrated treatment services. The target population was urban, homeless, HIV+ individuals with substance dependence and/or mental illness diagnoses. Health and physical functioning were measured using a refinement of the Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey. Questions based on the PRIME-MD measured subjects’ mental health status. Outreach occurred at shelters, soup kitchens, and on the streets. The outreach team consisted of a nurse, substance abuse counsellor, and a formerly homeless person. Outreach contacted 3,059 individuals; 1,446 entered the clinic, 110 of 206 eligible candidates enrolled in the study, and 82.7% of study participants completed 12-month follow-up interviews. Enrollees exhibited 5th percentile composite health scores. They reported heavy street drug use and unmet service needs particularly for housing and financial assistance. Outreach successfully recruited targeted individuals into treatment. They stayed in treatment and demonstrated improvements on measures of physical and mental health 12-months later.

AB  - In 1983, the Des Moines (Iowa) Schools applied for approval to use the allowable growth funding provided in Senate File 2168 to expand and create additional programs for the prevention of dropping out as well as programs for students who had dropped out but were returning to school. The original proposal included the following: (1) an expansion of services in the Alternative High School; (2) initiation of the School-Within-A-School Program (SWSP) at three comprehensive high schools; and (3) the Dropout/Outreach Project (DOP) as an expansion of the New Horizons Program. During the 1985-86 school year, the SWSP was expanded to all high schools. This was followed by the funding of additional positions at the Alternative High School during 1986-87. During 1987-88, additional expansions were achieved. This evaluation study covers program attendance and dropout rates, enrollment, number of support service contacts, and reenrollment success data. Data are provided for 270 students in the SWSP, 130 students in the DOP, and 45 students in the Alternative Learning Program for Sophomores-To-Be. The total full-time equivalent staff for all of these programs included 30 teachers, program coordinators, counselors, associates, learning coordinators, and social workers. Recommendations are made regarding data collection, amelioration of poor parent participation and high dropout rates at certain locations, reporting of support service data, documentation of counseling activities, and long-range planning. Twelve data tables are included. The SWSP Student Attitude Survey, the DOP One-to-One Structured Interview, and the DOP Training Plan are appended. (TJH)

AB  - Evaluated 2 mental health services based on their success in reducing the incidence of homelessness among severely mentally disabled people. Findings are presented on 2 client populations (132 homeless [HL] people and 176 HL people [mean age 28 yrs]) at different points of entry into community care: (1) the first 6 mo following hospital discharge and (2) during 3 yrs of service in an outreach and case management program targeted to HL mentally ill people. Program failure in serving HL mentally ill people at both the entry and subsequent contact points was revealed. Issues in evaluating community-based care are discussed.

AB  - Most of our public problems--from crime to racial tensions to substance abuse--directly involve and affect young people. The goal of this guide is to create opportunities for young people and adults to talk candidly about youth issues, develop new ideas, and work together to implement these ideas. It fosters democratic dialogue by advocating the use of study circles in which young people themselves play key roles in organizing and leading the groups. The guide lays out basic material for a four- to seven-session discussion program and provides "how-to" information for discussion organizers, leaders, and participants. It provides participants an idea of the wide array of exciting youth work that is being done. The sessions explore such questions as what is it like to be young, how can the community be made a better place for young people, how to deal with racial tensions, violence, health, and substance abuse, and what can be done to make a difference. Materials are also included on study circles, how to organize and lead them, and ground rules for useful discussions. At the end of the guide is a resource list of organizations and publications that can aid further discussion and action. (RJM)

AB  - Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC) is a serious violation of the Human Rights with global and local implications. The multidimensionality of CSEC requires us to understand its historical elements, legal definitions, and psychosocial characteristics. International agencies, states, and national agencies (statutory and voluntary sectors) have agreed on an agenda of responses including research on CSEC, partnership and collaboration, legal changes and adjustment, promoting criminal prosecution, social policies and interventions for children and young people that have been made subject to CSEC. These interventions are diverse in their approaches, purposes, types of services, models, and critical points. In accordance with international agreements, the Chilean State recognised CSEC as a social problem and developed social policies, legal changes and intervention programmes across the country. In this context, practitioners have built a 'know-how' of social intervention in CSEC based on technical guidelines (social policy on CSEC), institutional directions and pragmatic decisions from fieldwork reflexivity. However, there is no clear evidence about the rationale, models, practices, strategies and critical points in the interventions and weakness in the monitoring and evaluations. Applied Discourse Analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between different levels of social intervention on CSEC: policy, intervention models and practices. The research purpose was to describe, understand, and analyse the programmes of social intervention in CSEC, the social intervention models, and the interdisciplinary practices in Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children, implemented in the decade of 2004-2014 in Chile. Government and alternative documents were analysed (13 each), discussion groups with interdisciplinary professional teams in CSEC (3), and a focus group (1) composed of policymakers, academics, researchers, police and judicial representatives was undertaken. These materials were data-managed and analysed using the software dedoose. All University of Edinburgh Research Ethics procedures were followed. The findings indicate that Government documents highlight two discursive styles: Mandatory and Pragmatic, regarding the intervention and the approaches used. These discourses (1) defined the interventions as a part of a system or building a network of services, (2) established a condition of the intervention that recognised children as a subject of law or recognised the specialised character of the intervention, and (3) based interventions on guidelines and ethical principles or challenges, and evidence-based approaches. Alternative documents developed a discursive style of Monitoring and Evaluation that emphasised (1) the complexity of CSEC and the need to develop responses, (2) then recognised challenges such a making visible CSEC and problems with the interventions; and finally (3) recommended the basis for the intervention. Mixed Stakeholders group (1) emphasised CSEC characteristics, and the institutional responses (2) specified the structure of the intervention, and (3) identified tensions and challenges in the adjustments of social policies and intervention practices, methodological needs, and the judicial system rationale and practices. These findings are significant because they help us to understand the processes involved in building appropriate and situated responses for children and young people that have been made subject to CSE on a local, regional and global level.

AB  - No Child Care Left Behind was introduced to establish global strategies utilized in identifying and reaching socioeconomically disadvantaged preschool students in child care and providing quality early learning experiences prior to the kindergarten registration. The mixed method approach to school readiness targeted 5 school administrators in Western Pennsylvania, whose schools were listed as the lowest performing elementary schools in the state. The schools represented four counties and were geographically located in 5 cities, in which 4 were declared as PA Act 47 Distressed Communities due to the defunct steel industry. In addition to the school administrators, the results of 201 child care directors operating programs in the State of Pennsylvania provided a quantitative analysis to measure school district outreach and their involvement in the child care community. Both school administrators and child care directors provided qualitative data from which the following themes emerged: Culture, Collaboration, Opportunity Gap, Readiness, Relationship, and Improvement. The study identified a wide opportunity gap existing between the child care setting and the kindergarten classroom reported by child care directors, who represented 49.8% socioeconomically disadvantaged facilities and 50.2% advantaged facilities according to the federal Title One eligibility guidelines. Of the 201 child care directors, 20% reported their facility was located in a community with a significant number of high school dropouts, 32% reported their facility was located in a high unemployment community, and 40% reported their facility was located in a community with a significant number of head of households identified as single mothers. However, only 10% of these directors reported that a kindergarten transition curriculum was made available to their preschool students, 7% were provided intervention support by the school to improve developmental delays, 5% had a kindergarten teacher visit their facility, 3% were provided a mentor from the school district, and only 2% directors agreed that a school administrator evaluated their program annually for instructional support. The study identified a need to bridge the gap between the kindergarten classroom and the child care setting regardless of facility type, quality improvement rating, or socioeconomic status in order to ensure that all preschool children enter kindergarten ready to learn.

AB  - The past forty years has been a time of great change in the history of the Catholic Church, including the educational role of the family. In the Vatican II document Lumen Gentium, the baptized are called a "People of God," and the family is described as a "domestic church." 1 In it, people are called upon to actively and responsibly work for the common good, to return to religious traditions in the home, and to care for the marginalized in one's family and community. The document challenges all to see the urgency of family members taking responsibility to work together for each other's survival and growth. With the belief that "family is at the heart of the Latino culture"2 and attentive to the challenge of Pope John Paul II that "the church can and ought to take on a more homelike or family dimension, developing a more human and fraternal style of relationships," 3 this study examines what it can mean to support and journey with Roman Catholic Latino families residing in New York City from the perspective of a parish religious educator. The case study method is used to probe the lived experience of Hispanic families as religious educators, and the role of parish religious educators seeking to journey with families. Conducting case study research is particularly important within the context of Latino communities where the diversity in families, neighborhoods, parishes, and schools is immense and multifaceted. Fieldwork was conducted at six parishes. Twenty Hispanic families with young children and adolescents were interviewed. Nine parish religious educators were interviewed including three pastors and six directors/coordinators of religious education. Parish observations included Eucharistic celebrations, annual processions and feast days, and parish sacramental processes. The study provides thick descriptions and portraits of the families, parish religious educators and faith communities to highlight myths, contemporary challenges and emerging opportunities. Some key findings that emerged from the study are as follows. Family unity was highly valued by the families interviewed and striving to foster family unity was a challenge for many. They acknowledged the centrality of the Sunday Eucharist as a family event. Families requested more family-centered and intergenerational parish processes and events since they noted that they were families that journey together. The study surfaced generational differences between first and second generation parents. For example, second generation mothers were less likely to see the good and beautiful in their places of residence and neighborhood. Parents wanted to introduce their children to their cultural heritage and language, yet, some were concerned that this could negatively impact their children. Families needed guidance on how family rituals, such as bedtime rituals, can evolve as their children grow and develop. Parents also sought guidance on 3 how evangelization and catechesis could occur with their spouses and other adult members of their families. Parish religious educators were striving to be inclusive of all families, those who were thriving and those at risk. They respected and integrated popular religion into the parish processes. Sacramental preparation processes were becoming more family-centered. Parish religious educators were advocates with families in diverse settings including their parishes, neighborhoods, schools, and social service agencies. The study also found that as parish religious educators partnered with families to provide more options and opportunities, it was difficult for some families to choose, perhaps, because having options was a new experience for them. The study recommends that parish religious educators partner with families to see and articulate in what ways religious education is manifested in their daily life, to guide families to discover their God-given gifts and talents, to discover meaningful service opportunities, to explore the role of arts in their lives, and to engage in justice issues. 1Vatican Council II.

AB  - Column description. Special Libraries, Special Challengesis a column dedicated to exploring the unique public services challenges that arise in libraries that specialize in a particular subject, such as law, medicine, business, and so forth. In each column, the author will discuss public service dilemmas and opportunities that arise in special libraries. Special or subjectmatter librarians interested in authoring a piece for this column are invited to contact Ilana Stonebraker at stonebraker@purdue.edu. This column is written by Jonathan M. Torres. Jonathan M. Torres is Business Research and Instruction Librarian at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He received his MLIS from Rutgers University One of the biggest challenges that new Business Librarians continuously face is discovering ways to introduce their role and research services to the department of which they serve. The Walton Reader’s Spotlight pilot program was created to bridge Business Librarianship and the Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville through methods which involved interviewing and media collaboration. This paper will explore the opportunities and challenges that are associated with developing a media outreach initiative of this magnitude. Furthermore, the article will touch on the outcomes and recommendations in order to strengthen the partnership between library services and the Walton College of Business through outreach services.

AB  - This paper reports on dilemmas encountered when doing ethnographic research with gang members involved in serious crime, based on a qualitative study in Canada of how 30 gang members, ages 12-17, accounted for their physical, sexual, & emotional violence against girlfriends, gays, & racial minorities. The main objective was to understand gang members' use of violence from their perspective. The construction of masculinity was an ongoing process for these youth, negotiated & developed with limited resources at hand. The degree, level, & objects of their brutal violence were associated with differences in their adherence to patriarchal-authoritarian models of family & gender at home & in the gang. Most were victimized by severe child abuse & neglect, witnessed horrific beatings of their mothers, & lived on the street. There were many dilemmas. First, victims of their violence had to be contacted to ensure safety & provide community resources. Many participants were on probation or in treatment facilities, & appropriate service providers had to be informed. Second, many were under the age of 16 years, & were being abused or neglected by family members. Under child welfare legislation in Canada, it is mandatory to report these incidents to child welfare authorities. Third, some were suicidal at the time of the interview, & required immediate mental health intervention. Youth who did not agree with these limitations to confidentiality were excluded from the study. These types of dilemmas were successfully dealt with to the benefit of participants & victims. Instead of avoiding this kind of fieldwork, researchers must continue to explore these issues & get proper training prior to commencing research. 2 Appendixes, 36 References.

AB  - In U.S. public bureaucracies, front-line staff continue to be the focal point for program administration and change, a situation which welfare programs illustrate well. As the primary access point to means-tested public benefits, caseworkers in welfare offices can have significant impact on the lives of our most vulnerable citizens. Caseworkers act as gatekeepers to material resources and programmatic information, and are the primary form of contact most clients have with the agency. This position gives these workers a unique role to play in informing, motivating and assisting welfare recipients. How these workers respond to client needs is largely determined by the way in which their jobs are structured within the particular organizational setting. While scholars of street-level bureaucracy have provided important insights into this relationship, they rarely attempt to go beyond the findings of their case studies to derive more general lessons. Using staff interviews and in-depth observations of California welfare and welfare-to-work programs we inductively developed a framework for investigating how the organizational setting mediates between policy goals and front-line behavior. We illustrate the utility and continuing relevance of our framework using illustrations both from our pre-welfare reform fieldwork as well as from more recent post-reform/TANF studies.

AB  - This paper examines the cultural and structural difficulties surrounding effective prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) in rural Lesotho. We argue for three strategies to improve PMTCT interventions: community-based research and outreach, addressing cultural and structural dynamics, and working with the relevant social groups that impact HIV prevention. These conclusions are based on interviews and participant observation conducted within the rural Mokhotlong district and capital city of Maseru, involving women and men of reproductive age, grandmothers serving as primary caretakers, HIV/AIDS program staff, and medical professionals. Qualitative analysis focused on rural women's socio-medical experience with the four measures of PMTCT (educational outreach, voluntary counseling and testing, antiretroviral interventions, and safe infant feeding). Based on these results, we conclude that intervention models must move beyond a myopic biomedical 'best-practices' approach to address the social groups and contextual determinants impacting vertical HIV transmission. Given the complexities of effective PMTCT, our results show that it is necessary to consider the biomedical system, women and children, and the community as valuable partners in achieving positive health outcomes.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of Project SMILE, a school-based early intervention program for identified at-risk 4th, 5th, and 6th grade students in Fresno Unified School District during the 1991-1992 academic year. This program was a collaborative effort utilizing advanced graduate students in clinical psychology and social work, under professional supervision, for service delivery. Project SMILE was a broad-based, early intervention utilizing four treatment components: group counseling, individual counseling, consultation with teachers, and family outreach. It was designed to reduce the risk of future social and behavioral problems, including substance abuse, by raising self-esteem, reinforcing prosocial skills, developing problem-solving and communication skills, facilitating the identification and expression of feelings, and teaching constructive feedback skills. This study included 318 project participants and 229 nonparticipant controls. Pre- and postintervention levels of self-esteem were assessed by teachers using the Behavioral Academic Self-Esteem (BASE) rating scale and by group leaders using the Group Leader Rating Form (GLRF). The BASE was completed for all program participants and controls. The GLRF was completed by 13 group leaders on 100 participants only. Due to a nonequivalent control group, pre- to postintervention change for program participants could not be linked to the intervention. Post hoc analyses were not conducted to explore differential program effects related to gender and ethnicity due to the nonequivalent control group. Within intervention group analysis found gender and ethnicity differences which existed prior to the intervention. The absence of program effects is discussed, particularly in light of methodological considerations for community-based outcome research.

AB  - The present study was designed to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis B and C virus (HBV, HCV) infections and risk factors in the Turkish general population. Participants were enrolled from urban and rural areas of the predetermined 23 EUROSTAT NUTS 2 region. A two-stage stratified sampling method was used to select participants from these regions ( n = 5460; 50.9% females; mean (SD) age: 40.8 (14.7) years). Sociodemographics, clinical characteristics and risk factors were recorded at home visits. The seropositivity rates for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-HCV, anti-HBs and anti-HBc total were 4.0%, 1.0%, 31.9% and 30.6%, respectively. Among HBsAg-positive cases, 94.5% were anti-HBe-positive, 70.2% were HBV-DNA-positive and 2.8% were anti-HDV total positive; 99.1% of HBV infections were of genotype D. Close contact with a hepatitis patient (OR 3.24; 95% CI 2.25–4.66; p < 0.001), living in the southeastern region (OR 2.74; 95% CI 1.7–4.45; p < 0.001), male gender (OR 1.77; 95% CI 1.28–2.46; p < 0.001), being married (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.02–2.57; p 0.038), educational level less than high school (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.04–2.26; p 0.03), orodental interventions (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.01–2.35; p 0.047) and a history of non-disposable syringe use (OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.01–1.96; p 0.045) were significant determinants of HBsAg positivity. Age ≥50 years (OR 2; 95% CI 1.09–4.3; p 0.026) was the only significant predictor of anti-HCV positivity. In conclusion, our findings revealed an HBsAg positivity in 4% and anti-HCV positivity in 1% of the adult population and at least one-third of the population has been exposed to HBV infection in Turkey.

AB  - Research on the relationship between Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) and Post Partum depression (PPD) is limited. Numerous antecedents and consequences of both IPV and PPD are noted in the literature, however understanding the impacts of partner violence on the postpartum mood are not clearly understood. This exploratory study used a mixed methods design to further understand the relationship between IPV and PPD among women who are living in an impoverished section of an urban community. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted from a pediatric/perinatal social work outreach program in a moderate size urban community (N=128). Individual logistic regressions on IPV and PPD were used to calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals for the factors in each of the risk areas: socio-demographics, social support, stress, substance use/abuse, trauma and prenatal depression. Results indicate a significant relationship between PPD and prenatal depression. Numerous significant relationships between factors and IPV were found, specifically: age, social support, substance use, child protections involvement. Qualitative analysis further revealed key findings to suggest that there is an indirect relationship between IPV and PPD, resulting from childhood abuse trauma, social support and prenatal depression. Social support appears pivotal for women who have experienced childhood abuse trauma; those with deficits in family social support appear to have a higher likelihood of entering an abusive adult relationship and are at higher risk of developing and suffering more severe PPD. Prenatal depression is also prominent in women who experience PPD and the incidence of prenatal depression appears influenced by IPV. The findings add to the limited research evidence surrounding the emerging complex relationship between IPV and PPD, and provide a framework that can guide social work practice and inform a future research agenda. This research provides a level of consciousness raising that will hopefully impact social work practice through a heightened awareness of issues that plague women.

AB  - China is moving ahead with the Silk Road Economic Belt, an ambitious infrastructure development agenda with the distinct promise of regional and sub-regional economic development. However, the initiative will create new environmental risks across the entire Eurasian continent, especially in countries with predominately poor records of environmental governance, including the former Soviet republics and Russia. Concurrently, on the domestic front, the Chinese Government has launched a new policy paradigm, “ecological civilization,” to dramatically improve environmental regulations, reduce pollution, and transform industries by adopting new green technologies and higher environmental standards. But does China’s intention to go through a “green shift” domestically resonate with these new transborder infrastructure development mega-projects? This paper will attempt to answer this question by juxtaposing China’s new domestic policy paradigm with environmental standards currently proposed in its global outreach projects focusing on China-northern Eurasia and China-Russia, including trade exchanges in natural resources.

AB  - Describes a training program for individuals recruited from the poverty sector of the population for the purpose of working with young children. Attempts were made to interest this population in child-rearing concepts that were essentially strange to them. The process of imitation followed by identification with the staff was used to involve the trainees with each infant or toddler assigned to them. Results of the training program were (a) trainees' control of children's aggression became more adaptive and flexible, (b) trainees came to view the child as capable of social responsiveness, and (c) trainees became more sensitive to the development of mother-infant reciprocity.

AB  - The current study explored attributions made by youth work professionals ("workers") in out-of-school time (OST) programs about the social circumstances of and perceived need of program youth. It followed prior research examining impacts of worker-level attributions on decision-making in service delivery. Two types of OST programs were selected as positive developmental settings for youth, support and opportunity programs (SO) and civic participation (CP) programs. Uniquely this study combines the decision-making relevance of attribution theory and research on street level workers with the developmental and lifecourse relevance of the positive youth development perspective and developmental systems theories. This study sought to determine potential variability in attributions made by workers about the determinants of youth circumstances and need. To this end, this qualitative study used participant observation and in depth interview methods with 17 workers from four OST programs serving predominantly African American and Latino/a youth in urban Los Angeles. A majority of attributions were about diminished ecological assets that inhibited positive youth development. For workers in both SO and CP programs, mentorship, youth-friendly spaces and opportunities, or "Me-Spots," were critical but absent youth assets. All workers described youth as resilient and positive, but nuanced differences existed among workers in their descriptions of specific asset pathways. Implications for professional development, practice and research are discussed.

AB  - Unaccompanied homeless youth (< 25 years of age) are the group most likely to be underreported in annual point-in-time (PIT) counts of unsheltered individuals. This practice note reviews the process of a collaborative partnership between a university and community to conduct a successful youth PIT count outreach that more accurately reflected the number of homeless youth. In addition to almost doubling the number of unsheltered homeless youth who were identified between 2013 and 2014, several positive outcomes for students, providers, and faculty resulted through the project's efforts. These outcomes, including increased student exposure and interest in this vulnerable population, are reviewed.

AB  - Background. The Georgia Breast Cancer Genomic Health Consortium is a partnership created with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to the Georgia Department of Public Health to reduce cancer disparities among high-risk minority women. The project addresses young women at increased risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome through outreach efforts. Methods. The consortium provides education and collects surveillance data using the breast cancer genetics referral screening tool (B-RST) available at www.BreastCancerGeneScreen.org. The HBOC educational protocol was presented to 73 staff in 6 public health centers. Staff used the tool during the collection of medical history. Further family history assessments and testing for mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes were facilitated if appropriate. Results. Data was collected from November 2012 through December 2013, including 2,159 screened women. The majority of patients identified as black/African American and were 18-49 years old. Also, 6.0 % (n = 130) had positive screens, and 60.9 % (n = 67) of the 110 patients who agreed to be contacted provided a detailed family history. A total of 47 patients (42.7 %) met National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines when family history was clarified. Fourteen (12.7 %) underwent genetic testing; 1 patient was positive for a BRCA2 mutation, and 1 patient was found to carry a variant of uncertain significance. Conclusions. The introduction of genomics practice within public health departments has provided access to comprehensive cancer care for uninsured individuals. The successful implementation of the B-RST into public health centers demonstrates the opportunity for integration of HBOC screening into primary care practices.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore whether methods of program referral affect service usage, likelihood of service use, and service delivery among Family Resource Center (FRC) consumers. This study used an exploratory design and utilized secondary data. Ten sites participated in the statewide study of consumer perceptions of FRCs funded by the State of California Office of Child Abuse Prevention. The most frequent media referral came from flyers (n = 19, 6.9%). For personal acquaintance, the most frequent referral came from friend, relative, or neighbor (n = 137, 49.6%). For professional agency, the most frequent referral came from school personnel (n = 29, 10.5%). The results of this study showed some significant program referral differences in terms of likelihood of service use and satisfaction with service delivery among FRC consumers. Implications for outreach and recruitment efforts are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: The Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law in 2010, was incrementally implemented by a series of reforms including an expansion of health insurance coverage and preventive services coverage without co-pay. It is not known whether CVD preventive services have increased as a result of enhanced healthcare access. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that CVD risk factor screening and counseling would increase among US adults over the period of ACA implementation, 2011-2015. Methods: The National Health Interview Survey is a telephone survey of a random sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. Respondents (n=101,243) from survey years 2011, 2013, and 2015 were asked whether, in the past year, they had a screening test for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes, and counseling about diet and smoking cessation from a health professional. We calculated annual percent change (APC) for each preventive service, using weighted constant-time Cox regression models, and examined whether findings were similar across demographic groups. Results: Health insurance coverage increased from 2011-2015, primarily among lower socioeconomic status (SES) individuals and younger adults. There were significant annual increases in the prevalence of screening and counseling for each CVD risk factor (Table). Increases were larger among lower SES groups for blood pressure and cholesterol screenings. Increases were larger among younger age groups for blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screenings, but were larger among older, Medicare-eligible adults for diet counseling. There were no significant differences in APC increases by gender or race. Conclusions: CVD risk factor screening and counseling increased during ACA implementation. Differential increases across SES and age groups indicate improved access to care in populations that have been previously underserved. Outreach is needed to ensure newly insured persons are aware of covered CVD preventive services.

INCREASED OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE EXPECTED TO NARROW THE GAP BETWEEN REPORTED AND UNREPORTED CASES OF NEGLECT AND ABUSE. HOWEVER, CASELOAD GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO REVEAL A SECOND GAP -- THAT BETWEEN TREATMENT NEEDS AND TREATMENT RESOURCES. SINCE 1975, NEW JERSEY HAS EXPANDED THE PROVISION OF PROTECTIVE SERVICES TO CHILDREN THROUGH NEW LEGISLATION, EXPANDED REPORTING MECHANISMS, ACCELERATED PROGRAM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICES AND RESOURCES. IT IS NOTED THAT PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT MUST BE BALANCED WITH EVALUATION AND CONTROL OVER THE QUALITY AND IMPACT OF SERVICES. A TREATMENT NETWORK THAT INCLUDES PREVENTIVE AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS, COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY SERVICES, AND MEASURES TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS UNDERLYING CHILD ABUSE IS PROPOSED. DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF PROGRAMS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE NETWORK ARE PROVIDED. SUPPORTING TABULAR DATA ARE APPENDED. (LKM)

AB  - Introduction: Homelessness is a public health problem, and persons experiencing homelessness are a vulnerable population. Estimates of the number of persons experiencing homelessness inform funding allocations and services planning and directly determine the ability of a community to intervene effectively in homelessness. The point-in-time (PIT) count presents a logistical problem in large urban areas, particularly those covering a vast geographical area. Materials and Methods: Working together, academia, local government, and community organizations improved the methodology for the count. Specific enhancements include use of incident command system (ICS), increased number of staging areas/teams, specialized outreach and Special Weapons and Tactics teams, and day-after surveying to collect demographic information. Results: This collaboration and enhanced methodology resulted in a more accurate estimate of the number of persons experiencing homelessness and allowed comparison of findings for 4 years. While initial results showed an increase due to improved counting, the number of persons experiencing homelessness counted for the subsequent years showed significant decrease during the same time period as a “housing first” campaign was implemented. The collaboration also built capacity in each sector: The health department used ICS as a training opportunity; the academics enhanced their community health efforts; the service sector was taught and implemented more rigorous quantitative methods; and the community was exposed to public health as a pragmatic and effective discipline. Practical Implications: Improvements made to increase the reliability of the PIT count can be adapted for use in other jurisdictions, leading to improved counts and better evaluation of progress in ending homelessness.

AB  - Children and adolescents are at high risk for sexual assault. Early medical and mental health evaluation by professionals with advanced training in sexual victimization is imperative to assure appropriate assessment, forensic evidence collection, and follow-up. Moreover, continued research and outreach programs are needed for the development of preventative strategies that focus on this vulnerable population. In this review we highlight key concepts for assessment and include a discussion of risk factors, disclosure, sequelae, follow-up, and prevention.

AB  - Combining current psychosocial theories with social network outreach and prevention paradigms is an effective mechanism for reducing both drug-related and sexual risks for HIV transmission in active drug users in mid-sized towns in the United States. Five hundred and seventy-nine individuals were recruited in two towns, one of 50,000 and one of 10,000 population. Three approaches to intervention were tested. These approaches included: (1) an intensive outreach program using indigenous outreach workers providing reinforcement of an HIV risk reduction program, and (2) a low intensity outreach program combined with a more intensive office-based HIV risk reduction program. Both conditions were compared with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommended standard intervention. Each of the enhanced interventions produced a reduction in HIV-related risk taking reported by the participants. The intensive outreach combined with office intervention and the intensive office intervention without outreach reinforcement each produced significant reductions in sexual risk taking in active drug users, beyond the reductions reported for the NIDA standard program. The enhanced risk reduction programs produced differential impacts for males and females, respectively, between the two high and low intensity outreach models.

AB  - A study of the initial phase of intensive work by England's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children indicated that while outreach techniques had dramatically reduced physical injury, there was long-term distortion in the child's relationship with parents less amenable to change. The most recent phase of work has concentrated on direct treatment of the abused child, using a multidisciplinary team that includes a play specialist & child psychotherapist in addition to social workers. Of 66 children seen between Apr 1977 & Dec 1979, almost all were found to be emotionally disturbed; even if the abuse did not recur they remained with considerable problems. Findings highlight the degree of emotional disturbance suffered by abused children. It is important to assess all children in the family situation & not to miss the quiet, depressed, withdrawn child who might have not been the subject of the initial referral. In some instances the needs of the child may outweigh those of the family, & the focus of treatment must be on the child. 1 Table. Modified HA.

AB  - A study of the initial phase of intensive work with families indicated that whilst outreach techniques had dramatically reduced physical injury there was long-term distortion in the child's relationship with mother (parent) less amenable to change. The most recent phase of work has concentrated on direct treatment for the abused child, using a multidisciplinary team that includes a play specialist and child psychotherapist in addition to the social workers involved. Out of a total number of 66 children seen between April 1977 and December 1979 it was alarming to find that almost all were emotionally disturbed; even if the abuse did not reoccur they remained with considerable problems The study highlights the degree of emotional disturbance suffered by these abused children and how they can be helped by focusing on their particular treatment needs. It is important to assess all children in the family situation and not to miss the quiet, depressed, withdrawn child who might not have been the subject of the initial referral. In some instances the needs of the child may outweigh those of the family and the focus of treatment must be on the child. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] En étudiant la première phase du travail intensif effectué avec les familles (d'enfants battus), on a constaté le phénomène suivant: les techniques de soutien et de surveillance ont abouti en une remarquable diminution des sévices physiques; cependant la relation de l'enfant avec la mère ou avec les parents reste perturbée et n'est pas facilement améliorable. Plus récemment, on a donc concentré les efforts sur le traitement de l'enfant lui-même. Pour cela, on a adjoint aux travailleurs sociaux une équipe multidisciplinaire comprenant un spécialiste du jeu et un psychothérapeute d'enfants. Entre avril 1977 et décembre 1979, ces équipes ont vu 66 enfants; presque tous étaient affectivement perturbés, même si les sévices physiques ne s'étaient pas reproduits, ce qui est très préoccupant. Cette étude a mis particulièrement en évidence les troubles psychiques dont souffrent ces enfants et montré aussi qu'on peut les aider considérablement en s'occupant de leurs problèmes individuellement. De plus, il faut absolument évaluer la situation de tous les enfants dans ces familles si l'on veut éviter de passer à côté de l'enfant déprimé, silencieux et replié sur lui-même, qui n'a pas fait l'objet du signalement initial. Il est des cas où les besoins de l'enfant sont plus pressants que ceux de la famille et où l'individu qui nécessite absolument le plus d'attention est l'enfant lui-même.

AB  - Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STI) and unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) have been increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco. However, HIV incidence has stabilised. Objectives: To describe recent trends in sexual risk behaviour, STI, and HIV incidence among MSM in San Francisco and to assess whether increases in HIV serosorting (that is, selective unprotected sex with partners of the same HIV status) may contribute to preventing further expansion of the epidemic. Methods: The study applies an ecological approach and follows the principles of second generation HIV surveillance. Temporal trends in biological and behavioural measures among MSM were assessed using multiple pre-existing data sources: STI case reporting, prevention outreach programmatic data, and voluntary HIV counselling and testing data. Results: Reported STI cases among MSM rose from 1998 through 2004, although the rate of increase slowed between 2002 and 2004. Rectal gonorrhoea cases increased from 157 to 389 while early syphilis increased from nine to 492. UAI increased overall from 1998 to 2004 (p<0.001) in community based surveys; however, UAI with partners of unknown HIV serostatus decreased overall (p<0.001) among HIV negative MSM, and among HIV positive MSM it declined from 30.7% in 2001 to a low of 21.0% in 2004 (p<0.001). Any UAI, receptive UAI, and insertive UAI with a known HIV positive partner decreased overall from 1998 to 2004 (p<0.001) among MSM seeking anonymous HIV testing and at the STI clinic testing programme. HIV incidence using the serological testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion (STARHS) peaked in 1999 at 4.1% at the anonymous testing sites and 4.8% at the STI clinic voluntary testing programme, with rates levelling off through 2004. Conclusions: HIV incidence among MSM appears to have stabilised at a plateau following several years of resurgence. Increases in the selection of sexual partners of concordant HIV serostatus may be contributing to the stabilisation of the epidemic. However, current incidence rates of STI and HIV remain high. Moreover, a strategy of risk reduction by HIV serosorting can be severely limited by imperfect knowledge of one's own and one's partners' serostatus.

AB  - Fully open or partly open geothermal systems can induce potentially damaging seismicity. How this seismicity should be addressed depends on the geothermal system, its operational characteristics, the geological context, exposed buildings, existing infrastructure and populations, and social concern. This paper proposes an initial screening tool, called G eothermal R isk of I nduced seismicity D iagnosis (GRID), for estimating to what extent induced seismicity is of concern for a specific project. A framework for tailor-made risk governance measures is then recommended, including hazard and risk assessment, social site characterization, seismic monitoring, insurance, structural retrofitting, traffic light systems, information and outreach, and public and stakeholder engagement. The proposed framework is currently customized to Switzerland and can be adapted to other regions or geo-energy applications.

AB  - Homeless adults may gain access to health services under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, which takes effect in 2014. This study analyzed the health coverage, health status, and health services use of 725 chronically homeless adults with disabilities in eleven cities in the United States. Nearly three-quarters of the chronically homeless adults in this study with incomes below the threshold for the Medicaid expansion were not enrolled in Medicaid. Fifty-three percent were uninsured or relied solely on state or local assistance, and 21 percent had other coverage that included Department of Veterans Affairs health care. The findings on differences in health status and service use across groups suggest that the Medicaid expansion offers important opportunities to increase coverage and access to care for chronically homeless adults. There may be potential savings for states that expand Medicaid, as people transition from state and local assistance to more comprehensive services under Medicaid. Targeted outreach and assistance to enroll eligible homeless people will be necessary. A broad range of physical and mental health services will be required, including case management to coordinate services.

AB  - Objectives. We examined the proportion of homeless veterans among users of Veterans Affairs (VA) emergency departments (EDs) and compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of homeless and nonhomeless VA emergency department users nationally. Methods. We used national VA administrative data from fiscal year 2010 for a cross-sectional study comparing homeless (n = 64 091) and nonhomeless (n = 866 621) ED users on sociodemographics, medical and psychiatric diagnoses, and other clinical characteristics. Results. Homeless veterans had 4 times the odds of using EDs than nonhomeless veterans. Multivariate analyses found few differences between homeless and nonhomeless ED users on the medical conditions examined, but homeless ED users were more likely to have been diagnosed with a drug use disorder (odds ratio {[}OR] = 4.12; 95% confidence interval {[}CI] = 3.97, 4.27), alcohol use disorder (OR = 3.67; 95% CI = 3.55, 3.79), or schizophrenia (OR = 3.44; 95% CI = 3.25, 3.64) in the past year. Conclusions. In a national integrated health care system with no specific requirements for health insurance, the major differences found between homeless and nonhomeless ED users were high rates of psychiatric and substance abuse diagnoses. EDs may be an important location for specialized homeless outreach (or ``in{''} reach) services to address mental health and addictive disorders.

AB  - Objective: The Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) program provides Veterans Health Administration outreach services to veterans incarcerated in state and federal prisons. This study used HCRV data to compare risk of incarceration of veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF), Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and New Dawn (OND) and other veterans and to identify sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of incarcerated veterans of OEF/OIF/OND. Methods: Administrative national data were analyzed for 30,968 incarcerated veterans, including 1,201 OEF/OIF/OND veterans, contacted from October 2007 to April 2011. Odds ratios were calculated comparing the risk of incarceration among OEF/OIF/OND and other veterans in the HCRV sample and in a weighted sample of nonincarcerated veterans from the 2010 National Survey of Veterans. Stepwise logistic regressions of HCRV data examined characteristics of incarcerated veterans independently associated with OEF/OIF/OND service. Results: Regardless of ethnicity or age, OEF/ OIF/OND veterans were less than half as likely as other veterans to be incarcerated and constituted only 3.9% of the incarcerated veterans. Compared with other incarcerated veterans, OEF/OIF/OND veterans were younger, were more likely to be married, were more likely to report combat exposure, expected a shorter incarceration, were 26% less likely to have a diagnosis of drug abuse or dependence, and were three times more likely to have combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conclusions: OEF/OIF/OND veterans appeared to be at lower risk of incarceration than veterans of other service eras, but those who were incarcerated had higher rates of PTSD. Efforts to link these veterans to mental health services upon their release are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Homeless adults may gain access to health services under the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, which takes effect in 2014. This study analyzed the health coverage, health status, and health services use of 725 chronically homeless adults with disabilities in eleven cities in the United States. Nearly three-quarters of the chronically homeless adults in this study with incomes below the threshold for the Medicaid expansion were not enrolled in Medicaid. Fifty-three percent were uninsured or relied solely on state or local assistance, and 21 percent had other coverage that included Department of Veterans Affairs health care. The findings on differences in health status and service use across groups suggest that the Medicaid expansion offers important opportunities to increase coverage and access to care for chronically homeless adults. There may be potential savings for states that expand Medicaid, as people transition from state and local assistance to more comprehensive services under Medicaid. Targeted outreach and assistance to enroll eligible homeless people will be necessary. A broad range of physical and mental health services will be required, including case management to coordinate services.

AB  - Street outreach is one of the most direct methods of engaging homeless individuals, but the characteristics of those most likely to be engaged this way is not well-understood. Data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Homeless Operations Management and Evaluation System showed that of the 70,778 literally homeless veterans engaged in VA homeless services in 2011-2012, 12% were through street outreach while the majority was through provider referrals (41%) and self-referrals (28%). Veterans engaged through street outreach had more extensive histories of recent homelessness, were more likely to be chronically homeless, and were more likely to be referred and admitted to the VA's supported housing program than other veterans. These findings suggest street outreach is an especially important approach to engaging chronic street homeless veterains in services and linking them to permanent supported housing.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Although there are growing numbers of homeless female U.S. veterans, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has traditionally served a predominantly male population; thus, it is important to examine differences between homeless female and male veterans in their service needs and the current provision of VA homeless services. Methods: A national registry of 119,947 users of VA homeless services from 2011 to 2012 was used to 1) estimate the proportion of female veterans among VA homeless service users, 2) examine the proportion of VA homeless service users who are literally homeless by gender, and 3) report differences between female and male VA homeless service users who are literally homeless on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as on outreach, referral, and admission patterns for an array of specialized VA services. Findings: Of VA homeless service users, 8% were female compared with 7% among all homeless veterans, 6% among all VA service users, and 7% among all veterans. Of female VA homeless service users, 54% were literally homeless, slightly fewer than the 59% of male VA homeless service users. Comparing literally homeless VA service users, females were younger, 21% more had dependent children, 8% more were diagnosed with non–military-related posttraumatic stress disorder, and 19% to 20% more were referred and admitted to VA's supported housing program than males. Conclusions: Female veterans use VA homeless services at a rate similar to their use of general VA services and they have unique needs, especially for child care, which may require additional specialized resources.

AB  - This study explored differences between homeless male veterans in metropolitan and micropolitan cities in Nebraska on sociodemographic, housing, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics as well as health service use. A convenience sample of 151 homeless male veterans (112 metropolitan, 39 micropolitan) were recruited from Veterans Affairs facilities and area shelters in Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, and Hastings in Nebraska. Research staff conducted structured interviews with homeless veterans. Results showed that compared to homeless veterans in metropolitans, those in micropolitans were more likely to be White, unmarried, living in transitional settings, and were far more transient but reported greater social support and housing satisfaction. Veterans in micropolitans also reported more medical problems, diagnoses of anxiety and personality disorders, and unexpectedly, were more likely to report using various health services and less travel time for services. Together, these findings suggest access to homeless and health services for veterans in micropolitan areas may be facilitated through Veterans Affairs facilities and community providers that work in close proximity to one another. Many homeless veterans in these areas are transient, making them a difficult population to study and serve. Innovative ways to provide outreach to homeless veterans in micropolitan and more rural areas are needed.

AB  - Objective: This study compared characteristics and outcomes between veterans who participated in veterans treatment courts (VTCs) and veterans involved in criminal justice who participated in other treatment courts (TCs) or who participated in neither VTCs or TCs. Methods: Data from 22,708 veterans (N = 8,083 VTC participants, 680 participants in other TCs [other-TC participants], and 13,945 participants in neither VTCs nor TCs [non-TC participants]) in the Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO) program were analyzed by using multilevel regression models. Results: VTC participants were more likely than other VJO participants to have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, but there were no sociodemographic disparities in access to VTCs. VTC participants were more likely than non-TC participants to have drug or public-order offenses, and they were more likely than other-TC participants to have DUI offenses. VTC participants had better independent housing outcomes than other VJO participants, and they had better employment outcomes than non-TC participants. However, VTC and other-TC participants were also more likely to have jail sanctions and new incarcerations compared with non-TC participants. Conclusions: VTCs are a growing service model that serves a broad group of veterans with a range of criminal offenses. Although VTCs show moderate benefits in housing and employment, specialized services are needed to reduce recidivism and maximize these benefits.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is shifting its focus from ending veteran homelessness to preventing veteran suicides. With supporting data, this Open Forum argues that VA homelessness services also help address veteran suicides. Analysis of a nationally representative survey of U.S. veterans in 2015 shows that veterans with a history of homelessness attempted suicide in the previous two years at a rate >5.0 times higher compared with veterans without a history of homelessness (6.9% versus 1.2%), and their rates of two-week suicidal ideation were 2.5 times higher (19.8% versus 7.4%). Because the majority of veterans who die by suicide are not engaged in VA care, VA services for the homeless that include outreach efforts to engage new veterans may be reaching some of these veterans. Thus continued federal support for VA homelessness services not only may help address homelessness but also may help prevent suicide of veterans.

AB  - To assess U.S. veterans' awareness and participation in suicide prevention programs offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). A nationally representative sample of 1002 veterans was surveyed online in 2018. The majority of veterans reported knowing about Vet Centers (72%), the Veterans Crisis Line (65%), and the VA Center for Suicide Prevention (54%). However, only 5% had attended a community event related to veteran suicide and 2% had used VA's Virtual Hope Box. Veterans aware of the Veterans Crisis Line had more medical conditions and were more likely to report VA as their primary healthcare provider. Veterans aware of VA's Center for Suicide Prevention were younger, male, had more medical conditions, and more likely to screen positive for posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and past homelessness. History of suicidal ideation or attempt was not associated with awareness of suicide prevention programs. VA's suicide prevention programs reach a broad segment of the veteran population, including those with and without histories of suicidality. More targeted outreach may be needed for veterans most at-risk for suicide who are unaware of available resources.

AB  - This chapter attempts to elucidate how ADHD came to be extensively recognized, diagnosed, and treated in Taiwan. Considering the late development of child psychiatry as a professional specialty and the foreignness of the concepts of child mental disorders in Western psychiatry for local people, the clinical realization of ADHD as a medical problem was achieved by co-constructing a child psychiatric network consisting of related ideas, agents, instruments, activities, organizations, and institutions. Further, the network was not monolithic but reconfigured over time when its key components changed. I draw on data from various sources to illustrate these points. The sources include the historical archives of the Department of Psychiatry and the Children's Mental Health Center at National Taiwan University Hospital, both of which were early builders that developed the Taiwanese child psychiatric network; the (auto)biographies of pioneering professionals; local newspaper articles on hyperactive children since the 1950s; relevant medical and educational academic research, popular literature, and government documents and regulations; brochures issued by relevant parental organizations; and discussions about ADHD in parenting forums such as BabyHome, the largest parenting website in Taiwan, and the 'BabyMother' and 'SP_Teacher' boards on PTT, the largest Chinese language-based bulletin board system. I also conducted fieldwork to gather data from 2013 to 2015. I participated as an audience member in ADHD health education activities held in medical institutions and as a speaker in various panel discussions on ADHD hosted by different organizations. In the following sections, I contextualize the process of medicalizing ADHD in Taiwan into three historical periods: (1) the initiation of Taiwanese child psychiatric services and school-based mental health programs (1953-77); (2) the emergence and stabilization of the ADHD diagnosis as well as the expansion of the child psychiatric network (1978-97); and (3) the network reconfiguration and the biomedicalization of ADHD (1998-present). With the continuing reassembly of this child psychiatric network, the prevailing perspective on children's hyperactivity has changed from a 'maladjustment' to a 'biomedical condition,' but the efforts to frame it as a medical problem and to expand the corresponding medical treatments remain unchanged and in full force.

AB  - Conducted an outreach project to increase the number of high-risk and homeless youth who receive HIV test results and posttest counseling, and examined the effects of in-person vs telephone notification method options. Oral HIV testing and counseling were offered at sites at which youth congregate in Portland, Oregon. Ss were randomized to receive test results and posttest counseling either face-to-face or by telephone. Results show that among the 351 13-24 yr olds tested, 48% followed up to receive test results and posttest counseling. Adolescents most likely to receive their results were female, older (19-24 yrs), White and those who reported high-risk behaviors. Those with the option of telephone notification were significantly more likely to receive their results than those required to have face-to-face notification. This was true regardless of age, race, history of previous HIV testing, or high-risk behaviors. Two youths tested positive for HIV. Both were assigned to the face-to-face notification group and, therefore, no HIV positive results were given by telephone. It is concluded that the option of telephone notification significantly increased the proportion of youth who received posttest counseling and results following community-based testing.

AB  - The decreasing number of sustaining Catholic schools has limited diversity in educational options for families, affecting local district finances, reducing potential for academic competition among schools, and increasing crime and violence in in the areas where these schools have closed. In 2013-2014, 9 out of 22 Catholic secondary schools closed or merged in the Northeast region of the United States. However, some schools in the Northeast region have been thriving and sustaining their students and programs. Utilizing Fullan’s systems thinking on sustainability as conceptual framework, a descriptive case study of a successful Catholic secondary school in the Northeast region was completed to find best practices and strategies to duplicate in other Catholic schools. Nine semistructured personal interviews were conducted, and relevant school documents were reviewed. Data analyses included open and axial coding, resulting in themes that revealed elements assisting school sustainability, including effective financial planning for affordability, educational programs, collaboration, communication, diversity, administrative support, trust in leadership, Catholic identity, and safe environment. Successful leadership strategies were developed from these elements and incorporated into A Guide for Catholic School Leaders on Successful Sustainability. This guide will be presented as a professional development preparation program for secondary Catholic school leaders. This project study has the potential to produce positive social change by improving school leader preparation, increasing educational diversity, providing services to the local community, and directing outreach to the increasing immigrant population.

AB  - Purpose Drop-in centers for homeless youth take a low barrier approach to addressing both their basic needs (e.g., food, hygiene, clothing) and higher level needs (e.g., substance use treatment, mental health care, HIV/STD-related programs). Prior studies indicate that youth who use drop-in centers show improvements in health-related behaviors over time. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with drop-in center attendance in this population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a probability sample of 226 youth who were unaccompanied (not living with a parent or guardian) and experiencing homelessness (mean age = 21.58 years; 27% female, 43% non-Hispanic White) to examine associations between predisposing, enabling and need factors with any drop-in center attendance and frequency of attendance in the past 30 days. Results Youth were more likely to have used a drop-in center if they reported hygiene-related needs (i.e., showers, clean clothes) and more positive perceptions of the drop-in center environment. Of youth who reported any drop-in center use, attendance was more frequent among those who also used shelter services, perceived that more of their friends used a drop-in center, knew staff who they could count on for support, and had a more avoidant attachment style within close relationships. Conclusions The factors associated with any use of drop-in center services are distinct from those that may encourage homeless youth to use these services more frequently. Identifying these different set of factors can inform future outreach and intervention efforts to increase drop-in center utilization in this vulnerable population.

AB  - In Thailand more than 9,000 HIV-infected children receive free antiretroviral therapy (ART) through the public health system. This pioneering public health programme has received international acclaim but to date there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the various elements that have contributed to its scale-up in the paediatric population. Using a definition of the continuum of paediatric HIV treatment and care that starts at transmission of HIV and ends with transition of adolescents to adult services this thesis analyses it on three levels: policy, provider and service-user. It examines HIV policies and the Children's ART Network (CAN) model; the delivery of paediatric services; and service-users' ability to access treatment services consistently. It aims to document these perspectives to learn lessons of relevance to policy makers and service-providers in Thailand and beyond. The objectives were met using a multi-method approach comprising predominantly qualitative research techniques, supported by quantitative data and triangulation. In order to represent the range of experiences data were collected from sites in two provinces representing each type of service-provider: university, provincial and district hospitals, and two HIV orphanages. The fieldwork took place over 14 months (March 2008-May 2009) and comprised a review of ART policy; interviews with policy "actors" (n=27); focus-group discussions with HIV service-providers (n=3); interviews with HIV-positive adolescents and caregivers (prior and current) of HIV-positive children (n=45); quantitative analysis of hospital and orphanage registry data (n=498); and, a questionnaire survey of service-users (n=252). Evaluation of health policy made clear the importance of pro-poor health reforms in the 1990s and early 2000s that have entitled Thais to free health-care, including H IV services for eligible individuals. The government programme for HIV positive children was designed to address their diagnostic, treatment and support needs in a holistic way. These far reaching measures contributed to the Thai HIV treatment programme being recognised as global leaders of the public health approach to HIV treatment. However, some health-systems and policy gaps have emerged. Policy interviews showed that policy development slowed, partly due to altered financial priorities within the health sector, but also to divisions between the health-financing department and the co-ordinating body of the national AIDS programme. Policies relating to paediatric HIV are fragmented, sometimes poorly implemented and some child-specific elements have been neglected. There are other areas of concern too: HIV incidence - including among pregnant women - have shown indications that it will increase, infant prevention strategies (through PMTCT) have reduced transmission rates but HIV- infected mothers seem less likely to receive antenatal care; children continue to present late for HIV services; and skilled support for adolescents and their transition to adult services is limited. Focus-group discussions revealed highly motivated peer-support volunteers operating in hospitals and the community who provide support to health workers and HIV-affected families throughout the continuum. They would benefit from a more secure funding mechanism and accreditation. Well-trained, dedicated healthcare providers struggle to deliver the standard of service they feel HIV-infected children need. The government programme is scaling-up the 'CAN' model through which children are referred back to receive treatment at district hospitals (supervised by tertiary hospitals), are supported by peer volunteers, and where possible a 'one-stop service' is implemented. It was considered by many respondents as the best way to cover children's diverse care needs across the continuum. Qualitative investigation of patients' and caregivers' experiences showed that many service- users, who are increasingly approaching adolescence, live in extreme poverty with an elevated perception of HIV stigma. To avoid recognition, some travel to distant hospitals for treatment, yet most rural residents are generally very satisfied with the services in their community-focused local district hospital. Most caregivers take treatment adherence and regular clinic attendance very seriously; they value psycho-social support and information they receive from peer-support volunteers highly. The prior caregivers of children living in orphanages suggested that, apart from poverty, the difficulties facing families have changed since ART became widely available. In the pre-ART era stigma and chronic ill health were major reasons for extended families choosing to send children to orphanages. Drug resistance, difficulties with treatment adherence and coping with adolescent behaviour are now more likely to be among the reasons. Quantitative data sources confirmed these findings and found that most children sought treatment late in the course of their HIV disease. This finding is consistent over time despite the introduction of free treatment and of strategies to prevent mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) nationwide. Many children at the study sites are orphaned, and live with elderly and poorly educated caregivers with limited treatment literacy and low aspirations. Overall the triangulated findings reveal a high standard of paediatric HIV care is delivered in Thailand through a sophisticated system. Using the concept of a continuum to analyse child HIV services has identified strengths such as strong links between communities and clinics forged by peer supporters. It has also identified some gaps and changes over time. Given the current profile of children entering and already enrolled in the programme now is the time to address missed opportunities for early paediatric treatment, prioritize adolescents' needs and strengthen existing capacity of health-workers and volunteers to identify and respond to children's social, economic and psychological conditions. The national committee that co-ordinates the multi-sectoral HIV policy response could maximize the opportunities presented by the strengths of the current Children's ART Network to better address the entirety and complexity of paediatric needs, rather than paediatrics as an adjunct to adult services.

AB  - This thesis examines the experiences, circumstances and difficulties faced by young homeless people residing in hostels in the county of Kent, South East England, especially those who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ). My research suggests that there is an increase in LGBTQ youth homelessness due to young people 'coming out' at younger ages than before and encountering difficulties in their family homes that lead to their homelessness. I refer to this as 'the paradox of progress'. Due to political advances in gay rights and an increased media presence of charismatic LGBTQ proponents, youth are changing their outlook on sexuality and gender identity, but paradoxically due to generational differences, some meet adversities at home. Yet, this research also shows that an ensuing prevalence and increase of LGBTQ youth in homeless hostels across the county is a significant concern that thus far has been overlooked. In this thesis I demonstrate that youth homelessness is distinct from adult homelessness and is often misunderstood. Using data obtained through anthropological fieldwork over a period of one year, combined with my professional experience as a support worker working in local homeless hostels for over eight years, I examine and analyse the structural violence and inequalities that young people encounter as they attempt to cope with their homelessness caused by various factors such as deprived family backgrounds, class and a housing crisis that has predominantly affected disadvantaged youth. The long-term dedicated ethnographic fieldwork approach of my research has enabled me to glean insights about current ideas about home, homelessness, and also experiences of young people who live in difficult circumstances, subsequently enabling this research to challenge contemporary understandings of and responses to youth homelessness. Homeless youth navigate their lives in localities where ideas of 'home' hinge upon idealised heteronormative family life trajectories and generalised stigmas of youth homeless as beggars, rough sleepers or substance misusers and as culpable for their own predicaments. In this thesis, I discuss how the lack of or slim options for housing and support available to homeless youth in Kent, reflect upon how the State and the general public homogenise and stigmatise youth who are from working class backgrounds, thus creating further disadvantages that subject them toward structural violence. The anthropology of youth literature (e.g. Wulff 1995, LeVine and New 2008, Peluso 2015) suggests that the agency of young individuals should not be underestimated or subsumed under broader adult studies but that their lives ought to be studied in their own right. My ethnographic data contributes to such literature and further engages the anthropology of home, gender and sexuality to understand the issues that come together to comprise contemporary youth homelessness in Britain. Ethnographic research is well suited to explore intimate topic such as sexuality and homelessness, and thus far anthropologists have not studied LGBTQ youth homelessness. To date, the monitoring of sexual orientation and gender identity in the voluntary sector uses unrealistic figures that obscure the severity of LGBTQ youth homelessness. Subsequently LGBTQ individuals are not recognised by funding bodies and the State as a significant population and therefore resources are not allocated to alleviate their challenges and/or support them. This thesis argues that a prominent reason for LGBTQ youth homelessness is the paradox of progress; that the broader political advances in LGBTQ rights are not yet resonating in the reality and lived experiences of LGBTQ individuals in Kent. Young people who are both homeless and a sexual or gender minority, experience exclusion by living outside of the norm in terms of their sexuality/gender identities, as well as living outside of normative institutions such as, the educational system, home and the family. Furthermore, I suggest that conflicting generational views toward 'alternative' sexualities and genders contribute to the increasing numbers of LGBTQ youth in homelessness services. This thesis contributes to the limited ethnographic studies available regarding youth homelessness in anthropology. It also aims to offer insights to broad literatures in social, political, economic and applied anthropology, the anthropology of youth, the anthropology of care, kinship studies, the anthropology of Britain and the anthropology of home and homelessness. Additionally, it has the potential to be of interdisciplinary interest, as it draws on insights from the disciplines of sociology, human geography as well as literature from queer and gender studies. Finally, this research will inform homelessness and housing policies and facilitate a better understanding of the under-researched topic of LGBTQ youth homelessness. The outcomes of my research suggest that policy makers in voluntary and government agencies need to employ a culturally sensitive approach to housing policy for youth and young individuals who identify as LGBTQ and those that are homeless.

AB  - Since youth with alcohol-related problems are typically reluctant to seek help for their alcohol abuse, services should focus on those problems for which the adolescent will seek help, such as personal growth, educational and vocational development, recreation, and creative expression. Youth are more likely to participate in programs that are easily accessible, confidential, and available at convenient hours. The availability of a comprehensive range of services and activities is essential for effective treatment. A comprehensive approach includes intensive and long-term treatment, an indirect therapeutic strategy, an early intervention strategy, and a prevention strategy. Service components must encompass mental health services, physical health services, social services, career counseling services, alternative education activities, legal counseling services, youth awareness and life skills workshops, ethnic/cultural enrichment activities, creative and vocationally oriented training workshops, recreation and physical education activities, and youth work and leadership training activities. Treatment gains must be maintained through aftercare programs.

AB  - The goals, services, and administration of North Shore Community College's (NSCC) Center for Alternative Studies (CAS) were the subject of the workshop described in this report, which was conducted by the National Council of Community Services and Continuing Education. After the workshop's agenda is presented, the text is provided of CAS Director Anita Turner's discussion of the characteristics of the adult, nontraditional students served by the Center and her description of the nontraditional outreach approaches used to reach them. This is followed by Nancy Murphy's outline of the alternative services offered by the Center to accommodate the special needs of adults with family and job commitments: (1) assessment of prior experience for which credit may be granted; (2) credit by examination; (3) General Educational Development (GED) testing; (4) individualized learning contracts; (5) internships and career exploration; and (6) independent directed study. The remarks of four former CAS students, who discussed the value of the program to their personal and professional lives, are presented prior to Joseph Boyd's examination of the economically depressed area served by one of the Center's branches and of the grassroots efforts made to gain community support. Outlines of the goals and objectives of the Center and NSCC conclude the report. Three exhibits are appended, providing program guidelines for students; sample learning contracts and forms; and a faculty payment policy statement. (JP)

AB  - The Viburnum Foundation, a family foundation based in New York, is currently in the fifth year of giving grants to rural library-sponsored family literacy programs in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The libraries involved in the Viburnum Family Literacy Project are in areas with high levels of poverty and illiteracy. The programming, which usually takes place at a library, a Head Start Center, or a school, may include parenting classes for adults, adult literacy and English as a Second Language instruction in classrooms and by tutors, storytelling and reading aloud to children exclusively or for all generations, and bilingual programming for adults and children. This report discusses what makes library-based family literacy programs work, and how policymakers, grantmakers, and community leaders can collaborate to promote family literacy in rural areas. Following an introduction, the body of the report is divided into six main sections in terms of the following topics and subtopics: 1) the rural library as a site for family learning and the rural community as a site for social change; 2) program staff and participants; 3) partnerships; 4) programs (planning, budgeting and spending, program design, content and activities, impacts); 5) grantmaking issues; and 6) critical areas of change. A concluding chapter reiterates the reasons why libraries and literacy programs are critical to the health of society, and outlines difficult challenges to be faced in the near future. Appendices present a Viburnum Foundation project history and list of Viburnum sites. (AEF)

AB  - The new millennium brings a heightened awareness of the continued and urgent need to address the lack of educational progress for Latinas and Latinos in American higher education. The Latina/o population is now the nation's largest racial/ethnic group and continues to grow. Latina/o enrollments in higher education have not kept pace relative to their growing population. The severe underrepresentation and underachievement of Latina/o students in the face of today's legal challenges to affirmative action policies shape the context for Latinas/os in American higher education today. In this special issue, authors present empirical findings and observations, both from quantitative and qualitative perspectives, of Latina/o participation and experience in higher education. Writings from a historical perspective provide important background knowledge with which to view the many contemporary experiences of Latinas/os on campus. This collection of readings highlights the work, research perspectives, and theoretical models of many distinguished scholars of Latina/o higher education. The authors underscore the fact that we know many of the factors that do work to promote Latina/o student achievement, as reflected in such outreach programs as Puente. Articles presented here also point to the high level of poverty within Latina/o populations and their often limited college-going experience.

AB  - Examines G. K. Chesterton's conception of the "common man" to explore the control of social space through grass-roots community youth work. Special attention is given to the type of spatial imaginary produced by youth work carried out in spaces of the urban poor. Youth work focused on risk management, surveillance, & self-regulation is compared to the opposition between an unimaginative state obsessed with rational control & a working class London neighborhood in Chesterton's Edwardian satire, The Napoleon of Notting Hill (1904), which speaks "across time" to antagonisms of contemporary youth work. Chesterton's approach to social space illustrated in his description of Pump Street is explored. Differences between his view of the common man's urban public space & those of George Bernard Shaw (2000) & Jack London (1963) are explored. Themes present in Chesterton's work that are applicable to modern day youth work, especially New Labour's "economistic, instrumental view of youth & community work," are discussed to suggest that today's youth might be better served by "dreamers" than the current pragmatic realists.

AB  - Leaders of youth intervention programs provide a significant social service by redirecting at-risk youth onto a productive path. The standards for youth-serving organizations are inconsistent from 1 organization to another across a wide range of youth-worker training certification programs in the United States. A single-case study was conducted to explore the strategies that 3 leaders of a nonprofit organization located in Minnesota, use to select, collect, and analyze data to assess the effectiveness of training certification programs for youth workers. The 2017-2018 Baldrige Excellence Framework provided the structure for a systems-based evaluation of the client organization; Freeman’s stakeholder theory was the conceptual lens for the study. Data were collected from conducting semistructured interviews, reviewing the participating organization's internal documents and performance outcomes, and analyzing open-source resources. Through thematic analysis, 4 key themes emerged: (a) the social return on investment analysis and the overall cost savings by investing in and supporting youth programs, (b) the opportunity to focus research on certification for youth workers, (c) the value of providing training for youth workers, and (d) the opportunity to provide a platform for the youth to share success stories with their community. Specific recommendations stemming from the research findings were to create a state or national recognition standard for youth-worker certifications and to make youth work a paid profession. Implementation of these recommendations may result in positive social change by improving the lives and trajectories of youth.

AB  - Law enforcement officers are confronted with a variety of different social, economic, physical, health, and mental health issues when policing the homeless population (Jay, 2017; Otu, 2016). This exploratory study examined the lived experiences of 10 Colorado Springs Police Department (CSPD) law enforcement officers. Officers assigned to the Homeless Outreach Team (HOT) or the Downtown Area Response Team (DART) specialized groups of law enforcement officers who interact with homeless individuals daily within the Colorado Springs, Colorado? The central research question this study was; What are the training improvements that law enforcement managers need to assist law enforcement officers when policing homeless individuals in Colorado Springs, Colorado? The study's conceptual framework examined the history of law enforcement, leadership and leadership styles, police training, community policing, policies and procedures, ordinance enforcement, and the CSPD's HOT and DART teams. Data collection consisted of semi-structured face-to-face interviews, which allowed participants to share their personal and professional experiences when responding to a homeless persons' service calls or community-related issues. The following seven themes evolved during the interviews: (1) community policing, (2) training, (3) partnering, (4) laws and ordinances, (5) resources, (6) support, and (7) staffing.

The first lesson is designed to familiarize students with the gang prevention program and to discourage them from joining gangs by providing positive alternatives. The goal of the second lesson is to develop student awareness of the violence involved in gang membership and participation, while the third lesson is designed to increase student awareness of how families are affected by youth membership in gangs. Goals of the remaining five lessons are to heighten student knowledge of the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, to identify the negative effects of graffiti, to help students increase their self-esteem and self-confidence, and to develop student awareness of positive alternatives to youth gang membership. Each lesson is accompanied by a list of objectives, supplies, and activities. 3 references

AB  - Objectives We examined the logistical challenges of conducting an outreach, secondary prevention program for adults discharged from Alice Springs Hospital following an acute presentation of cardiovascular disease. Design and Setting This represents a sub-study of the Central Australian Heart Protection Study ( CAHPS). Clinical, logistic and demographic data were used to examine the characteristics of outreach visits in the intervention arm of the study. Participants Fifty subjects initially allocated to the intervention arm of the trial were studied. Main outcome measures Completion of scheduled, plus additional outreach visits according to the intervention protocol. Results The majority of subjects presented with an acute coronary syndrome (44/50 (88%)) and 31 (62%) were of Indigenous ethnicity. However, Indigenous subjects being younger (53.1 ± 11.1 versus 58.0 ± 11.0 years non-Indigenous) had a more complex risk factor and co-morbid profile, with significantly more diabetes (77% versus 26% P < 0.001), hypertension (81% versus 53% P = 0.04) and renal failure (52% versus 21% P = 0.03). Community of origin of Indigenous subjects was 230 ± 208 km from the hospital versus 61 ± 150 km for non-Indigenous subjects ( P = 0.004). Indigenous subjects missed a significantly higher number of scheduled visits at six months (1.39 ± 2.14 versus 0.16 ± 0.50 visits; P = 0.02). However, multivariate analyses suggested that distance did not influence successful completion of visits. Conclusions These early findings from CAHPS are invaluable to understanding and improving the feasibility of secondary prevention programs for Indigenous adults living with heart disease in remote communities.

AB  - While library programming for children is a staple in most public libraries, it is quite rare in the academic setting. In 2006 the education librarian at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire began offering literacy programs in a library that traditionally discouraged children and community members from using its resources. Successful programs now include monthly story time sessions, events for families, and a summer reading program for at-risk youth who participate in the Reading Partners and Upward Bound programs. Positive outcomes include media attention garnered both on and off campus, high attendance at programs, and increased collaboration with campus and community organizations.

AB  - Introduction: While child nursing students may expect to encounter child abuse and neglect and assume a safeguarding role when they qualify, those undertaking adult nursing courses may not expect to come into contact with children and may be even less likely to expect to encounter child abuse or neglect. This paper presents the findings of an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) study. Students learn through experience and reflection and Mezirow's Transformational Learning Theory (TLT) was used to explain the various ways in which nine adult nursing students attempted to make sense of and learn from their experiences of encountering perceived child abuse and neglect during their community placement. Study aim: The study aimed to examine the learning journeys of undergraduate adult nursing students who encountered perceived child abuse and neglect during their community placement. Design: The research was located within an interpretative philosophical paradigm. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) provided an in-depth insight into participants' individual lived experiences. Setting and participants: The fieldwork was undertaken at a Higher Education Institution in the North East of England. Participants were in the first year of an undergraduate nursing programme. Method: Data were collected using semi-structured face-to-face interviews and analysed using IPA. Findings: The nine participants underwent a process of transformational learning after encountering perceived child abuse and neglect. They found the initial experience disorientating because it challenged their pre-conceived ideas about families and communities. They experienced a range of negative emotional responses, including anger and some expressed judgmental views towards parents. However, their frames of reference changed as they began to critically reflect on and process their experiences and they were able to recognize, albeit to varying degrees, that they had enhanced their knowledge and learnt from the experience. Their understanding of the role of the adult nurse changed and they recognised they had an important role to play alongside other professionals in safeguarding children. Conclusions: The findings highlight there is a need for HEIs to ensure students on adult nursing programmes understand they have a role to play in protecting children; they also highlight a need for more effective preparation and support.

AB  - Path analysis was used to investigate the impact of childhood sexual abuse on later sexual victimization among 372 homeless and runaway youth in Seattle. Young people were interviewed directly on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. High rates of both childhood sexual abuse and street sexual victimization were reported, with females experiencing much greater rates compared with their male counterparts. Early sexual abuse in the home increased the likelihood of later sexual victimization on the streets indirectly by increasing the amount of time at risk, deviant peer affiliations, participating in deviant subsistence strategies, and engaging in survival sex. These findings suggest that exposure to dysfunctional and disorganized homes place youth on trajectories for early independence. Subsequently, street life and participation in high-risk behaviors increases their probability of sexual victimization.

AB  - Objective: To examine abuse specific variables among homeless and runaway adolescents and to look at perpetrators of childhood abuse. Method: A total of 372 homeless and runaway adolescents were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Results: Approximately one-half of these young people reported being physically abused and almost one-third experienced sexual abuse. Females experienced significantly higher rates of sexual abuse compared to males, and sexual minority youth experienced significantly higher rates of physical and sexual abuse compared to heterosexual youth. Average duration of physical and sexual abuse was 5 and 2 years, respectively. Both types of abuse were rated as extremely violent by more than half of those who were abused. The average number of different perpetrators of physical and sexual abuse was four and three, respectively. Biological parents were the majority of perpetrators for physical abuse whereas nonfamily members most often perpetrated sexual abuse. Average age of perpetrators was late 20s to early 30s and the majority of perpetrators were male for both types of abuse. Conclusions: The pattern of exploitation and victimization within the family may have serious and cumulative developmental consequences for these youth as they enter the street environment. Early intervention programs are needed to break the cycle of exploitation and abuse that adolescents experience within the family. Without intervention, many of these youth may be at risk of future exploitation and re-victimization out on the street.

Método: Un total de 372 adolescentes &ldquo;sin techo&rdquo; y que se han fugado de casa fueron entrevistados utilizando una estrategia de muestreo sistemático en el área metropolitana de Seattle. Los jóvenes fueron entrevistados en las calles y en los albergues por trabajadores sociales de agencias de atención a la juventud. Resultados: Aproximadamente la mitad de los jóvenes estudiados notificaron haber sido víctimas de maltrato físico y casi un tercio de ellos habían sido víctimas de abuso sexual. Las mujeres presentaban tasas más elevadas de abuso sexual que los varones y los sujetos homosexuales presentaban tasas más elevadas de maltrato físico y abuso sexual que los heterosexuales. La duración media del maltrato físico y el abuso sexual fue de 5 y 2 años, respectivamente. Ambos tipos de maltrato fueron catalogados como extremadamente violentos por más de la mitad de quienes fueron abusados. El número medio de perpetradores diferentes en los casos de maltrato físico y abuso sexual fue de 4 y 3 respectivamente. La mayoría de los perpetradores del maltrato físico fueron los padres biológicos, mientras que la mayoría de los abusadores sexuales fueron personas ajenas a la familia. Para ambos tipos de maltrato, la edad media de los perpetradores se encontraba entre el final de los 20 años y los primeros 30 años y la mayoría de ellos eran varones. Conclusiones: La explotación y victimización en la familia puede tener graves consecuencias evolutivas para aquellos jóvenes que entran en el ambiente de los sujetos &ldquo;sin techo.&rdquo; Se necesitan programas de intervención temprana que rompan el ciclo de explotación y maltrato intrafamiliar. Sin dicha intervención, muchos de estos jóvenes pueden tener riesgo de explotación futura y de revictimización.

Méthode: Un total de 372 adolescents sans domicile et fugueurs ont été interviewés selon une stratégie d'échantillonnage systématique à Seattle. Ces jeunes ont été interviewés dans les rues et dans des abris par des travailleurs sociaux d'agences pour la jeunesse. Résultats: A peu près la moitié de ces jeunes ont dit avoir été maltraités et à peu près un tiers avoir subi des abus sexuels. Les filles avaient subi significativement plus d'abus sexuels que les garçons et les jeunes de la minorité sexuelle, significativement plus de sévices physiques et sexuels que les jeunes hétérosexuels. La durée approximative des abus sexuels avait été respectivement de 5 et de 2 ans. Les deux types de sévices étaient évoqués comme extrêmement violents par plus de la moitié de ceux qui les avaient subis. Le nombre approximatif des différents agresseurs physiques et sexuels était de 4 et 3, respectivement. Les parents biologiques étaient en majorité les auteurs d'agressions physiques alors que les auteurs d'agressions sexuelles n'appartenaient la plupart du temps pas à la famille. L'âge approximatif des agresseurs se situait autour de la trentaine et ils étaient des hommes, en majorité, pour les deux types d'abus. Conclusions: Le mode d'exploitation et de victimisation dans la famille peut avoir des conséquences cumulatives désastreuses sur le développement de ces jeunes quand ils entrent dans l'environnement de la rue. Des programmes d'intervention précoce sont nécessaires pour briser le cycle de l'exploitation et des mauvais traitements dont ces adolescents font l'expérience dans leur famille. Sans intervention, beaucoup de ces jeunes peuvent encourir le risque d'une future exploitation et revictimisation dans la rue.

AB  - Objective: To examine family risk factors associated with dissociative symptoms among homeless and runaway youth. Method: Three hundred and twenty-eight homeless and runaway youth were interviewed using a systematic sampling strategy in metropolitan Seattle. Homeless young people were interviewed on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth service agencies. Results: The current study revealed widespread prevalence of dissociative symptoms among these young people. Multivariate analyses revealed that sexual abuse, physical abuse, and family mental health problems were all positively associated with dissociative symptoms. No gender differences were found for any of the models. Conclusions: Dissociative behavior is widespread among these youth and may pose a serious mental health concern. Some young people experience numerous stressors, and with few resources and little support available, many may invoke maladaptive strategies such as dissociative behavior to handle such situations, which may in turn be detrimental to their mental health. Unless youth are provided with programs and intervention, the cycle of abuse that they have experienced at home is likely to continue on the street.

AB  - This study examined the circumstances surrounding a homeless youth's "decision " to trade sex for food, money, shelter, or drugs. Forty homeless youth in 4 Midwestern states participated in individual, in-depth qualitative interviews. Interviewers recruited youth through both service agencies and street outreach. The findings revealed that approximately one third of the sample had some experience with trading sex, whether it was in the form of having traded sex, having been propositioned to trade sex but having refused, or having friends or acquaintances that had traded sex. Young people 's reports indicated that they had traded sex for things they deemed necessary in order to survive (i.e., food, shelter, money, or drugs) and that they did not want to trade sex, but did so because they were desperate and lacked alternatives. Additionally, others were coerced, manipulated, or forced to do so, indicating that the decision to trade sex is not always voluntary. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of cumulative effects on youths' later development. Directions for future research among this population are also discussed.

AB  - John Tyler and Magnus Lofstrom take a close look at the problems posed when students do not complete high school. The authors begin by discussing the ongoing, sometimes heated, debate over how prevalent the dropout problem is. They note that one important reason for discrepancies in reported dropout rates is whether holders of the General Educational Development (GED) credential are counted as high school graduates. The authors also consider the availability of appropriate student data. The overall national dropout rate appears to be between 22 and 25 percent, but the rate is higher among black and Hispanic students, and it has not changed much in recent decades. Tyler and Lofstrom conclude that schools are apparently doing about as well now as they were forty years ago in terms of graduating students. But the increasingly competitive pressures associated with a global economy make education ever more important in determining personal and national well-being. A student's decision to drop out of school, say the authors, is affected by a number of complex factors and is often the culmination of a long process of disengagement from school. That decision, not surprisingly, carries great cost to both the student and society. Individual costs include lower earnings, higher likelihood of unemployment, and greater likelihood of health problems. Because minority and low-income students are significantly more likely than well-to-do white students to drop out of school, the individual costs fall unevenly across groups. Societal costs include loss of tax revenue, higher spending on public assistance, and higher crime rates. Tyler and Lofstrom go on to survey research on programs designed to reduce the chances of students' dropping out. Although the research base on this question is not strong, they say, close mentoring and monitoring of students appear to be critical components of successful programs. Other dropout-prevention approaches associated with success are family outreach and attention to students' out-of-school problems, as well as curricular reforms. The authors close with a discussion of second-chance programs, including the largest such program, the GED credential. (Contains 1 table, 1 figure and 95 endnotes.)

AB  - Abstract: Though few studies exist on service utilization among homeless youth in the U.S., services are important because without them, many of these young people may resort to delinquent strategies in order to meet their daily survival needs. The current study examines frequency and correlates of service utilization (i.e., shelters, food programs, street outreach, counseling, STI and HIV testing) among a sample of 249 homeless youth ages 14 to 21. Multivariate analysis revealed significant differences in service usage by sex, age, and sexual orientation. Experiencing family physical and/or sexual abuse, being kicked out of the family home, spending more nights per week sleeping on the street, and having ever stayed in a group home facility were significant correlates of homeless youths'' service usage.

AB  - Homeless adults have high rates of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) and low levels of HCV knowledge. This study reports results of an interdisciplinary, community-based intervention using stakeholder cooperation, case management, risk factor identification, and modification of dysfunctional psychosocial factors to increase HCV knowledge among homeless adults ( N = 747). Data are from a randomized quasi-experimental study, with the major goal of evaluating the effectiveness of a Nurse Case Managed Intervention compared to a Standard Intervention, encouraging completion of a three-series hepatitis A/hepatitis B vaccination program. Increased HCV knowledge was measured with an 18-item questionnaire discerning risk factors for HCV and common misconceptions about individuals with HCV. A significant increase in HCV knowledge resulted regardless of intervention format. Receiving the Nurse Case Managed Intervention predicted greatest gain in HCV knowledge ( p < 0.000). Successfully engaging key stakeholders, outreach workers, community organizations, and homeless people themselves proved most efficacious in increasing HCV knowledge.

AB  - The purpose of this critical ethnographic study was to understand the phenomena of generational substance abuse of Hispanic mothers. By participating in family drug court (FDC), a therapeutic judicial program, rather than incarceration, mothers have a greater opportunity to address their substance abuse issues (Brown, 2010). Motivated to restore their domestic structures, FDC often allows them to address their substance abuse issues and regain custody of their children, who are usually in family or state’s care (Choi, 2012). In this study, generational substance abuse will be generally defined as those women who are FDC participants and have lost custody of their children, predisposing their children to become substance abusers. The theories guiding this study are Vygotsky’s (1934) Social Development Theory due to his work with the interdependence of individual and social processes; Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (1986) on human motivation and action; and the cultural work of Boas and Mead (1928). A FDC counselor, (gatekeeper of this study), provides access to clients in FDC and to graduates for up to one year. By using several artifacts the study was a purposeful sample clearly depicting the culture of the group. Data were gathered through fieldwork (Wolcott, 2008) in the form of observations, surveys, interviews, and a100-Item Parent Behavior Checklist (Fox, 1994a) recognizing client sensitivity. Interpretation of the data provided an essence of the phenomenon, producing a cultural portrait, integrating both emic and etic views. Fetterman’s (2010) approach of triangulating the data helped in identifying that this group of women need intervention strategies to improve their: education; employment, housing, parenting skills, decisions, cultural appreciation, and goal setting abilities.

AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of the Enviros Community Outreach Project, for adolescent girls at-risk and their families. Six adolescents and their parents participated in a 12 week project at Enviros Wilderness School Association in Calgary, Alberta. It was hypothesized that participation in the program would improve family and individual functioning. Adolescents were administered the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale (Fitts & Roid, 1991), and the Rotter Locus of Control Scale (Rotter, 1966); both parents and adolescents completed the Self-Report Family Inventory (Beavers, Hampson & Hulgus, 1985) pre- and post-intervention. Focus groups provided qualitative information. Statistically significant differences (at.10 and.05 levels) were found using the paired t-test. The results indicated that project participation positively influenced parental perceptions of conflict, health, and cohesion and adolescent perceptions of conflict within the family. Additionally, the post-intervention focus groups indicated favorable impressions of the ECO Project by both adolescent girls and their parents.

AB  - Models for Mental Disorder, first published in 1987, anticipated the move towards integration of psychiatric services into multidisciplinary teams (doctor, psychologist, nurse, social worker, etc) and the need to bring together the different philosophies of mental illness. Peter Tyrer has identified four different models of mental disorder that are relevant to clinical practice: the disease, psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioural and social models. Each model is described and reviewed, with reference to case studies and illustrations, to show how it relates to mental health disorders and can be used to interpret and manage these disorders. The book has been widely read and is often used for training purposes so that each professional can understand and appreciate that differences in viewpoint are often a consequence of one or more models being used in a different way rather than a fundamental schism in approach. Since the fourth edition was published in 2005, the disciplines of mental health have moved even closer together with the growth of assertive outreach and more integrated community teams. This, combined with the greater awareness of mental health among users of services, which leads to more penetrating and informed questions at interviews with professionals, has emphasized the need for a wider understanding of these models.

AB  - This report describes specific programs established in cities to respond to the special needs of mentally ill homeless persons. The service areas for which information is provided were identified by city officials and other participants of the 13 meetings sponsored by the Conference of Mayors to address the problems of the mentally ill homeless. Case studies of various program types are provided. One set of programs focuses on housing alternatives, including transitional and permanent housing programs with supportive services for various groups in the homeless mentally ill population. Other programs provide day drop-in centers, which offer positive alternatives to life on the streets through opportunities for social interaction and access to various services. Also provided are outreach services, which engage disaffiliated and isolated homeless persons unable or unwilling to seek services on their own. They are assisted in linking with the various services they need. Other programs train police officers who come into frequent contact with mentally ill homeless persons, so they may respond more effectively to this population. Information on case management services is provided in the descriptions of several of the programs. The appendix lists contacts in various cities for the various program types.

AB  - Since the explosion of homelessness in the 1980s, America has addressed the problem by providing emergency shelters. However, shelter alone is not the answer to homelessness. The failure of the emergency shelter approach alone has caused homeless individuals and families, as well as the community, to suffer. This report discusses the D.C. Initiative, led by Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros and the former(but then current)District of Columbia Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, in which a continuum of care system was proposed. The system consists of three basic components: 1) outreach/assessment, 2) transitional housing combined with rehabilitative services, and 3) placement into permanent housing. The report contains several charts to aide in its understanding.

AB  - In 1996 the CSPD received Federal funds to establish the DVERT. The program received funds to respond to system deficiencies and breakdowns, enhance law enforcement and prosecution in domestic violence cases, and increase the safety of victims and contain perpetrators, in addition to intervention and outreach services. DVERT is a systematic and multi-disciplinary response to spouse assault. The program was found to be a unique and active blend of social service and criminal justice components. A major difference between DVERT and other police programs is its view that the safety of the victim is the primary concern. DVERT and community-policing principles have become intertwined. The program focuses on three levels of domestic violence situations; the most lethal situations where a victim may be in serious danger, moderately lethal situations where the victim is not in immediate danger, and lower lethality situations where patrol officer engage in problem solving. In 1998, 21st Century Solutions received a grant from the National Institute of Justice to form a partnership with DVERT to conduct a process evaluation of the program. This study is the result of an 18-month evaluation examining the program. Data was gathered from case files, interviews with DVERT partners and victims of domestic violence, and observations of activities of the participants. Over the 18-month evaluative period, changes occurred regularly in its processes, decision-making, and personnel. Changes were seen as occurring because there was a belief in fixing and improving systems if they could serve clients/victims better. In 2000, the classification of cases changed dramatically. Levels I-III were replaced with new terminology and a new process. The 'Intake Team' is now responsible for reviewing all cases referred to DVERT. If the family is seen as benefiting from additional intervention, they are referred to the 'DVERT Assessment Team'. The Assessment Team consists of a detective, a victim advocate, and several officers working overtime with DVERT. The team provides short-term interventions in complex cases. If further interventions are necessary, the DVERT Ongoing Team steps in and handles the most dangerous cases. The emphasis remains on the safety of the victims. Significant findings were identified through the evaluation and may prove beneficial to practitioners and others interested in domestic violence. Findings include: (1) DVERT focuses on the safety of victims; (2) DVERT spreads the responsibility of the problem to a number of agencies; (3) DVERT handled nearly 1000 of the most serious domestic violence cases over the last 4 years; (4) offenders in the DVERT caseload were predominantly white males between the ages of 21 and 50; (5) victims in the DVERT caseload were predominantly white females between the ages of 16 and 50; (6) 'risk to children' was the most frequent reason for acceptance into the DVERT; (7) for cases opened in 1996, the average time to closure was 530 days and for cases opened in 1998 closures occurred within 210 days, a (60 percent decrease); (8) as a result of DVERT, the services to victims has improved; (9) victims have more resources through DVERT, such as safe housing and counseling; (10) for women and children involved in DVERT, violence seems to have been reduced; and (11) overall, through DVERT the CSPD has expanded its domestic violence operation. It has saved lives, reduced violence, improved communication among city and county agencies and service providers, and improved the quality of life in Colorado Springs. References, appendices

AB  - Today educators may feel the need to contemplate community-based education when (1) well intentioned citizens try to figure out what they can do to support or reform school art programs; (2) arts administrators seek to advance their enrollment figures; (3) citizens try to eliminate art education from school curriculums; (4) teachers try to figure out how to get students involved in "real world" situations; and/or (5) educators and artists confront important social issues through their artistic endeavors. At the risk of drifting away from some of the traditional focuses of art education, art educators need to take a careful look at the rationales, goals, and definitions of community-based art education before dismissing it, or conversely, implementing new programs of their own. Although several art educators (Bolin, 1999; Clark & Zimmerman, 2000; Congdon, Blandy & Bolin, 2001) have illustrated their concepts and implemented new courses and programs (Fahey & Frickman, 2000; Garber, 2004), it is the purpose of this article to take a second look at various forms of community-based art education and propose ideas for future curriculum initiatives.

AB  - This study examined the prevalence, severity, and circumstances of self-reported sexually coercive and abusive experiences in childhood and adolescence in a community sample of Latina women (N = 204) ages 18 to 34 years. Results from structured phone interviews indicated that 35% of the women reported experiencing some form of sexual abuse, 31% of the reported perpetrators were family members, and 52% were boyfriends, friends, or acquaintances. Of those who reported an abusive experience, 44% had not disclosed the abuse to anyone; for those who did disclose, 74% reported feeling supported. Findings highlight the importance of including peer and dating-partner abuse in the assessment of CSA and the necessity for outreach to Latina women who may have never disclosed their experiences of abuse.

AB  - Background: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising strategy for HIV prevention among men who have sex with men (MSM) and men who engage in sex work. But access will require routine HIV testing and contacts with healthcare providers. This study investigated men’s healthcare and HIV testing experiences to inform PrEP implementation. Methods: We conducted 8 focus groups (n = 38) in 2012 and 56 in-depth qualitative interviews in 2013–14 with male sex workers (MSWs) (n = 31) and other MSM (n = 25) in Providence, RI. MSWs primarily met clients in street-based sex work venues. Facilitators asked participants about access to healthcare and HIV/STI testing, healthcare needs, and preferred PrEP providers. Results: MSWs primarily accessed care in emergency rooms (ERs), substance use clinics, correctional institutions, and walk-in clinics. Rates of HIV testing were high, but MSWs reported low access to other STI testing, low insurance coverage, and unmet healthcare needs including primary care, substance use treatment, and mental health services. MSM not engaging in sex work were more likely to report access to primary and specialist care. Rates of HIV testing among these MSM were slightly lower, but they reported more STI testing, more insurance coverage, and fewer unmet needs. Preferred PrEP providers for both groups included primary care physicians, infectious disease specialists, and psychiatrists. MSWs were also willing to access PrEP in substance use treatment and ER settings. Conclusions: PrEP outreach efforts for MSWs and other MSM should engage diverse providers in many settings, including mental health and substance use treatment, ERs, needle exchanges, correctional institutions, and HIV testing centers. Access to PrEP will require financial assistance, but can build on existing healthcare contacts for both populations.

AB  - In response to a gap in veterinary care for low-income, under-served populations, the Student Health Outreach for Wellness (SHOW) Clinic in Phoenix, AZ took a One-Health initiative to establish a pilot veterinary care program to serve the veterinary needs of the local homeless pet owners receiving human medical care at the clinic. The study examines the pilot program through the lens of the human-animal bond (HAB) and focuses specifically on the attachment dimension of the bond as measured by the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale (LAPS). Data was collected from the homeless pet owners, and Rasch modeling was used to investigate the importance of various factors of the owner attachment to pet as described in LAPS items. The results demonstrate the perceptions of the homeless pet owners of ownership. The findings also provide psychometric evidence for revising the LAPS to better serve future research on human-animal relationships. Limitations and possible extensions of the research as related to the HAB and owner attachment to pets are discussed and enhancements proposed for the pilot program to better serve the local homeless people.

AB  - Data from the AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) Evaluation of Street Outreach Project conducted by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention are drawn on to investigate the demographic & lifestyle characteristics of 245 street youth in Los Angeles & San Diego, CA, 1993-1995. Results revealed high rates of problem behaviors & health risks: 34% reported affiliation with gangs, & 40% reported involvement in illegal activities such as prostitution, drug dealing, mugging, or stealing. Early adolescent street youth (ages 12-15) differed from older street youth on several demographic & lifestyle measures, & it is concluded that early adolescents are especially at risk for negative psychological & physical consequences of street life. 4 Tables, 33 References.

AB  - Aims: To understand how health‐related street outreach is perceived by homeless people with experience of sleeping rough. Specialist nursing and primary care services are expected to provide street outreach but there is no specific guidance on how to deliver it. Design: A qualitative description study. Method: Purposive opportunistic sampling was used to recruit participants from three drop‐in centres in London. Ten semi‐structured interviews were conducted between 4 June 2018 ‐ 28 June 2018 and Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis was used. Results: Health‐related street outreach was perceived as being able to offer a human connection that reduced the sense of isolation and exclusion commonly experienced on the street. People with experience of sleeping rough felt it could overcome access barriers and provide a bridge to healthcare services. Crucially the right approach was deemed to be essential and was defined by participants in terms of location, timing, the outreach team, and the verbal and non‐verbal styles used by outreach workers. Conclusion: Health‐related street outreach is a valuable health promotion tool for people experiencing homelessness that should be financially supported by healthcare commissioners and employers. Providers of health‐related street outreach must adopt the right approach and the development of guidelines could assist services to achieve this. Impact: The findings of this study can inform planning and review of health‐related street outreach to ensure that the approach taken by healthcare workers is acceptable to, and based on the views of, the people these services are provided for. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] 目的: 了解有露宿经历的居民对健康相关的街头外展服务的看法。专业护理和初级护理服务预计将提供街头外展服务,但没有关于提供该服务的具体指导。 设计: 定性描述研究。 方法: 采用有目的的随机抽样在伦敦的三个救助中心招募试验参与者。在2018年6月4日至2018年6月28日期间进行了10次半结构式访谈,此研究采用布劳恩和克拉克的主题分析法分析数据。 结果: 健康相关的街头外展服务被认为能够创造一种人际联系,可以减少大街上随处可见的孤立感和排斥感。有露宿经历的人认为街头外展服务可以帮助跨过接受医疗服务的阻碍,也是他们能获得医疗服务的桥梁。最重要的一点是,正确的获取方式被认为是必需的,并由参与者根据地点、时间、提供服务的团队以及外展工作人员使用的语言和非语言风格等方面决定使用哪种获取方式。 结论: 健康相关的街头外展服务是帮助无家可归者获得健康促进的有效工具,应该得到卫生保健专员和雇主的财政支持。与健康相关的街道外展服务的提供者必须采取正确的方法,指南的制定可以帮助服务机构实现这一目标。 影响: 本研究的结果可以为相关街道卫生服务的规划和审查提供信息,以确保卫生工作者所采取的方法是可接受的,并基于这些服务提供对象的观点。 (Chinese) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Advanced Nursing (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) is the property of John Wiley & Sons, Inc. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Unaccompanied homeless youth (< 25 years of age) are the group most likely to be underreported in annual point-in-time (PIT) counts of unsheltered individuals. This practice note reviews the process of a collaborative partnership between a university and community to conduct a successful youth PIT count outreach that more accurately reflected the number of homeless youth. In addition to almost doubling the number of unsheltered homeless youth who were identified between 2013 and 2014, several positive outcomes for students, providers, and faculty resulted through the project's efforts. These outcomes, including increased student exposure and interest in this vulnerable population, are reviewed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background One of the challenges facing the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is efficiently directing limited resources, such as specially trained personnel, community outreach activities, and satellite vaccinator tracking, to the most at-risk areas to maximize the impact of interventions. A validated predictive model of wild poliovirus circulation would greatly inform prioritization efforts by accurately forecasting areas at greatest risk, thus enabling the greatest effect of program interventions. Methods Using Nigerian acute flaccid paralysis surveillance data from 2004-2013, we developed a spatial hierarchical Poisson hurdle model fitted within a Bayesian framework to study historical polio caseload patterns and forecast future circulation of type 1 and 3 wild poliovirus within districts in Nigeria. A Bayesian temporal smoothing model was applied to address data sparsity underlying estimates of covariates at the district level. Results We find that calculated vaccine-derived population immunity is significantly negatively associated with the probability and number of wild poliovirus case(s) within a district. Recent case information is significantly positively associated with probability of a case, but not the number of cases. We used lagged indicators and coefficients from the fitted models to forecast reported cases in the subsequent six-month periods. Over the past three years, the average predictive ability is 86 ± 2% and 85 ± 4% for wild poliovirus type 1 and 3, respectively. Interestingly, the predictive accuracy of historical transmission patterns alone is equivalent (86 ± 2% and 84 ± 4% for type 1 and 3, respectively). We calculate uncertainty in risk ranking to inform assessments of changes in rank between time periods. Conclusions The model developed in this study successfully predicts districts at risk for future wild poliovirus cases in Nigeria. The highest predicted district risk was 12.8 WPV1 cases in 2006, while the lowest district risk was 0.001 WPV1 cases in 2013. Model results have been used to direct the allocation of many different interventions, including political and religious advocacy visits. This modeling approach could be applied to other vaccine preventable diseases for use in other control and elimination programs.

AB  - Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for American ages one to 44 and is ranked in the top ten causes of death for all age groups (CDC, 2006a). A Su Salud Injury Prevention was developed to address injury prevention awareness and education. The program is a mass media education campaign that uses role models, mass media, and community outreach to prevent injury. In 2009, University Health System (UHS) expanded the program. Baseline data were collected from 426 residents in targeted neighborhoods northwest of downtown San Antonio to support the expansion. The purpose of this study was to explore injury perceptions, knowledge, and behaviors of adults living in the expansion area, and define the predominant factors associated with these perceptions. A secondary aim was to assess community awareness and willingness to participate in the program. Survey results showed motor vehicle crashes (MVC), falls, drinking and driving, and guns and assaults were considered the most serious injures for adults. The most serious child injuries were MVC, abuse and neglect, falls, and head injuries. Residents were knowledgeable of state seatbelt policy, and over 90% responded as compliant for seatbelt and child car seat use. Most were knowledgeable about drinking and driving state policy and negative outcomes. However, 70% of those reporting driving under the influence of alcohol within the last year engaged in repeat high risk behavior. Men and residents under the age of 55 were more likely to engage in repeat drinking and driving (OR= 3.6, 7.0 respectively). Residents consider injury prevention an important issue, and have interest in a local injury prevention program. Younger women are the most likely to participate in a local program as potential role models and volunteers. Results from the study are summarized into an injury prevention and demographic profile of the community that will be used to develop tailored injury prevention messages to create a more effective program, and support program coordinators in effective community engagement. Results will also be used as a comparative basis for future evaluation of a behavioral injury prevention program focused on a predominantly Mexican-American community.

AB  - In the last few decades physical mobility has become one of the key elements of contemporary societies. This centrality of mobility also means the development of a new kind of social exclusion caused by the problems of living in a social context in which one has to be increasingly "on the move" to access goods and services. In this article, based on fieldwork conducted with 20 low-income family inhabitants of the city of Santiago, Chile, we study the role that mobile phone usage has in relation to physical mobility in the everyday lives of these individuals. Through an analysis of the pattern of usage and mobility of these devices, we arrive at the conclusion that rather than giving rise to an experience of constant mobility and "anytime-anywhere" availability, the individuals studied face limitations and exclusions that profoundly constrict the potential "mobility" afforded by these devices.

AB  - Since the 1960s, a number or relatively large irrigation projects have been established by Brazil's central government in the country's poverty stricken semi-arid Northeast region. This dissertation investigates the effects of these irrigation projects on primary schooling of local children. I build empirical models of the effects of irrigation on school participation and achievement based on the literature. These are then used to analyze the case of Petrolina, a municipality in the interior of the state of Pernambuco and in the center of the drought polygon. The analysis is based on fieldwork conducted in the area in 1998. I use published data and documents as well as regression analysis of a quantitative household survey conducted during fieldwork. Conclusions emphasize the effects of changes in the nature of risk and of migration flows on the circumstances faced by families in pursuing primary schooling for their children. Household financial stability proves to be particularly important for both school participation and achievement. I identify likely winners and losers with the process of change and recommend paths for future research.

AB  - DURING THE LATTER PART OF 1976, THE COMMITTEE INVITED MEMBERS OF THE SALT LAKE COMMUNITY TO PRESENT IDEAS AND CONCERNS ABOUT PROBLEMS INVOLVING MINORITIES AND WOMEN. THIS EFFORT WAS PART OF THE COMMITTEE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ADVISE THE U.S. COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROBLEMS IN THE STATE. IN JUNE 1977, AN EMPLOYMENT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO PERSONNEL IN FIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SALT LAKE. ALTHOUGH EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY (EEO) DIRECTORS HAD BEEN APPOINTED AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLANS HAD BEEN DRAFTED, MINORITIES SELDOM APPEARED ON MERIT LISTS, FEW TOOK EMPLOYMENT TESTS, AND MANY OF THOSE TESTED DID NOT PASS. ELEMENTS OF THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN FOR SALT LAKE CITY HAVING AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON MINORITIES AND WOMEN WERE THE LACK OF GOALS AND TIMETABLES FOR ORGANIZATIONAL UNITS AND JOB CLASSES, NO ACTION PROGRAM OR ANY PLAN DIRECTED TOWARD THE ELIMINATION OF PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED IN ACHIEVING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR JOB PLACEMENT AND UPWARD MOBILITY OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN, NO REVIEW OF PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEX DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES, LACK OF CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO RECRUITABLE MINORITIES AND WOMEN NOT IN THE WORK FORCE, AND SEXIST LANGUAGE. THE FIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCIES HAD NO OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS IN OPERATION, NO STRONG RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS THROUGH PUBLIC AGENCIES AND EMPLOYMENT OFFICES, NO CONSISTENCY IN EXAMINATION PROCESSES, AND NO SYSTEMATIC WAY OF CONDUCTING SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT PROCESSES. THE CONCEPT OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY, EVIDENCE OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE COURTS IN SALT LAKE, AND GOALS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLANS ARE DISCUSSED. APPENDIXES CONTAIN LETTERS ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FROM THE SALT LAKE COUNTY SHERIFF AND THE COUNTY ATTORNEY. TABULAR DATA ON EEO IN THE CITY AND COUNTY FOR 1975-1978 ARE PROVIDED. (DEP)

AB  - TO ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED UNDER THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION ACT OF 1974 SUPPLEMENTED, RATHER THAN REPLACED, FUNDING AUTHORIZED UNDER THE CRIME CONTROL ACT, CONGRESS MANDATED A MINIMUM FUNDING PROVISION FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAMS. THIS MAINTENANCE-OF-EFFORT REQUIREMENT STATES THAT AT LEAST 19.15 PERCENT OF CRIME CONTROL APPROPRIATIONS MUST BE FOR JUVENILE PROGRAMS. THIS FIGURE WAS BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE APPROPRIATED IN 1972. FOR FISCAL YEAR 1977 THE REQUIRED LEAA JUVENILE JUSTICE MAINTENANCE LEVEL WAS $126,773,000. THIS GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE REVIEW SURVEYED RECORDS AT LEAA HEADQUARTERS AND DID FIELDWORK IN THE STATES OF ILLINOIS, GEORGIA, ALABAMA, OKLAHOMA, AND KANSAS IN 1978. THE AUDIT CONCLUDES THAT LEAA NEEDS TO STRENGTHEN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MAINTENANCE-OF-EFFORT PROGRAM. SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES FOR ADMINISTRATION OF THIS REQUIREMENT HAVE NOT BEEN ASSIGNED AND COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES HAVE NOT BEEN CONSISTENT. WRITTEN PROCEDURES SHOULD BE SET UP FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING. DATA RECEIVED FROM 49 STATES AND 5 OTHER JURISDICTIONS INDICATE THAT ACTUAL EXPENDITURES WERE ABOUT $10.2 MILLION LESS THAN LEAA ESTIMATED FOR FISCAL YEAR 1975. IT IS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE COMPLIANCE REPORTS CONTAIN ONLY THE ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES AND NOT THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES. A NUMBER OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND PROCEDURAL CONTROLS ARE RECOMMENDED. LEAA'S RESPONSE TO THIS REPORT IS INCLUDED. IT EMPHASIZES THE DIFFICULTIES INHERENT IN WORKING WITH NUMEROUS STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN THE BLOCK GRANT SYSTEM. (GLR)

AB  - The Legal Services Corporation was created in 1975 and took over the 258 existing legal services projects. By 1980, the number of programs had grown to 319 staffed by about 5,300 attorneys and 2,500 paralegals. LSC received a $300 million appropriation for fiscal year 1980 and has requested $353 million for fiscal year 1981. In April 1978, GAO issued a report which discussed LSC's budgetary strategies, project management systems and priorities, and the congressionally mandated alternative service delivery study. The report was based on a review of 19 legal services staff attorney projects, 5 demonstration projects, and 7 support centers in 18 States. A November 1978 GAO report focused on the resources available nationally from all sources for free civil legal services for the poor and the coordination among the various providers. It also examined the extent to which the provided services reflected local needs and the adequacy of community legal education and outreach services by LSC grantees. The report used data from a review of 9 LSC grantees and 58 non-LSC legal services providers in 26 communities in 5 States, from a questionnaire survey of 278 Corporation-funded providers, and from interviews with over 1,200 poor persons in the visited communities. The third report, issued in October 1979, was based on interviews with LSC officials, private attorneys, insurance officials, and others. It discussed the opportunities for LSC to improve productivity and cost effectiveness by systemizing and automating its operations. The report also compared the costs of federally supported civil legal services and the same services under private prepaid plans and discussed the status of the alternative service delivery study. The principal recommendation is for an LSC research and demonstration program using systems analysis and computer technology.

AB  - A representative of the Justice Department provides an overview and status report of the Justice System Improvement Act agencies. This is followed by the testimony of the executive director and chairman of the Minnesota Crime Control Planning Board. He addresses the subcommittee on the issue of deferrals on spending monies to implement the Federal Juvenile Justice Act through the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Minnesota currently has 20 projects that operate on Juvenile Justice money. The chairman of the Minnesota Crime Control Planning Board argues that delays or deferrals in the awarding of Federal money for these projects will threaten their existence. Testimony is also provided by the chairperson of the Juvenile Justice Subcommittee, National Association of Counties, Criminal Justice and Public Safety Steering Committee. She testifies on the direct impact in the Nation's counties of an abrupt cutoff of funding for the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. Other witnesses represent the Volunteer Emergency Care Program in Richmond, Va., and the National Youth Work Alliance. They both testify about the importance of Federal funding for their work with youth.

AB  - The growing incidence of pediatric AIDS is discussed, and its high incidence among blacks and Hispanics involved in intravenous drug abuse is noted, with special reference to the situation in New York City. The high fatality rates among infants infected in utero with the AIDS virus and issues in caring for such children, many of whom are abandoned by their drug-abusing mothers, are discussed. Programs currently addressing some of these issues are described including hospital, day care, and residential programs for children with AIDS. Initiatives for dealing with the growing crisis are advocated, including revisions in the reimbursement system for medical care, development of foster care options for abandoned AIDS infants, increased training for caregivers and service providers, expanded outreach, and increased support services for families trying to cope with AIDS. Emphasis also is placed on the need for an all-out war on drugs through increased interdiction, law enforcement, and drug education and rehabilitation. The need for increased health education, focusing on strategies for reducing the risk of AIDS transmission, also is urged.

AB  - Effects of maternal cocaine use on the infants are identified, including chromosomal abnormalities, congenital defects, anemia, miscarriage, prematurity, and low birth weight. The high rates of venereal disease, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in drug-abusing mothers and their infants also is noted. State child abuse laws and protective services relating to parental drug abuse are described. Data on cocaine use are presented, and initiatives in this area undertaken by the National Institute of Drug Abuse are described: studies of the effects of maternal cocaine use on infant loss and development and the role of cocaine in teenage pregnancy; development of a medical curriculum for managing patient drug abuse; and increased attention to prevention, diagnosis, and developmental intervention. Programs targeting this problem include outreach, intensive neonatal care, parent education, and drug abuse treatment. Recommendations focus on the need for increased professional and public education; prevention programs; drug abuse identification, referral, and treatment services; improved child abuse legislation; and increased funding for programs, services, and research.

AB  - Previous hearings before the select committee on this subject documented the widespread problem of drug addiction among women of all socioeconomic groups and featured a model program for substance abusing women and their children in Detroit, the Eleonore Hutzel Recovery Center. The third hearing, reported in this document, discusses what policies and laws should be in place to ensure that those who need help receive it. Some witnesses argue that substance abuse during pregnancy amounts to child abuse and should be handled under child abuse reporting laws. Others recommend that substance-abusing pregnant women be identified and required to undergo drug treatment. Federal funding for preventive outreach and treatment early in a women's pregnancy is favored by many witnesses. Training of health care professionals to identify and treat substance-abusing, pregnant women is recommended as well. Prepared statements, letters, and supplemental materials

AB  - The statement of Wade Horn, Commissioner of the Administration for Children, Youth, and Families of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , profiles four programs through which Horn's agency is attempting to address the problems of homeless youth. The executive director of the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services presents testimony on the characteristics of homeless youth, the causes of youth homelessness, its consequences, barriers to service, current services for homeless youth, and recommendations for the future. Testimony by the executive director of the Sasha Bruce Youth Work, Inc., of the District of Columbia, profiles this program's work with homeless and runaway youth. The testimony identifies youth whose family problems can be resolved, older homeless adolescents who can benefit from independent living services, youth who do not have resolvable family problems and are not ready for independence, and youths who are living on the streets. Recommendations for improved programming are offered. Testimony is also presented by the clinical director of the Bridge, Inc., a comprehensive multi-service agency for runaway and homeless youth in Boston, Massachusetts. The Rev. Thomas Behrens, chairperson of the Youth Committee of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless and executive director of the Northside Ecumenical Night Ministry, describes work with homeless youth in Chicago. His work is based on establishing contact with homeless youth through drop-in centers and emergency overnight shelters and then building trust that can lead to the provision of crisis, transitional, and long-term services. Clarence Small, director of emergency services for Wyandotte House, Inc., in Kansas City discusses family reunification for runaway youth.

AB  - The program components are prevention education, streetwork outreach, and client rehabilitation. Prevention education informs students, communities, and professionals who work with youth about the dangers of sexual exploitation. The program helps identify youth who may be at risk of victimization because of their family circumstances or experiences of abuse and refers them to appropriate agencies. Street work outreach uses a mobile van and outreach workers to contact young female prostitutes on the streets of Manhattan to help meet their medical, social, and psychological needs. Client rehabilitation provides access to counseling and supervised living for young women who are ready to make the transition from street life to independent living. The chapter on organization and management addresses staffing, financial management, coordination and networking, and research and training. Steps are described for the establishment of a program, and resources are listed.

AB  - PWWI is funded by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), with support from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), both divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services. This collaboration combined MCHB's expertise in high-risk pregnancies, primary care, and outreach to underserved populations with CSAP's work in community education substance abuse prevention and treatment. This substance abuse prevention grant program emphasizes the development of innovative, community-based models of drug prevention, education, and treatment; services include prenatal, postpartum, and infant services. Many of the programs also provide case management, parenting classes, and referrals to drug and alcohol programs. The projects reach a large proportion of low-income and minority clients; crack/cocaine is the drug most frequently addressed by these programs, followed by alcohol and polydrug abuse. The summaries provide information about the diverse types of interventions being carried out by programs serving pregnant and postpartum drug abusing women and their children.

AB  - The video portrays the actual work of outreach staff as they contact and instruct intravenous drug users in behaviors that can reduce their risk of becoming infected with the HIV. Comments are also offered by project administrators and the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which has researched the effectiveness of various programs to modify the high-risk behaviors of drug abusers. Outreach workers are shown entering the sites frequented by intravenous drug abusers to make the contacts necessary to begin educating the abusers about safe, drug-using behaviors designed to reduce the incidence of AIDS. Their primary focus is on instructing drug users in how to clean their syringes after each use or how drugs can be ingested without the use of needles. Commentators advise that outreach educational and counseling programs have been effective in changing addicts' high-risk behaviors, as evidenced in decreased intravenous drug use and a reduction in the incidence of AIDS among intravenous drug users.

AB  - Program goals are to develop and implement policies, protocols, and services that promote the early identification, intervention, and prevention of domestic violence and child victimization; to increase victim safety and access to treatment and counseling; to enhance the investigation and prosecution of domestic violence and child abuse cases; and to develop and implement comprehensive strategies that draw on a rural jurisdiction's unique characteristics and resources and enhance community understanding of domestic violence and child victimization. The grant application kit is geared to dealing with unique problems in rural areas, including geographic isolation, barriers created by the social climate of rural jurisdictions, lack of information about domestic violence and child victimization, limited access to criminal and civil remedies, and joint victimization of mother and children. The Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program encourages rural and tribal criminal justice practitioners to work in partnership with social service agencies, local service providers, and community leaders. Programs include but are not limited to education and training, public awareness, treatment and counseling services, innovative strategies to address constraints faced by victims in rural communities due to geographic isolation (transportation, communication, and economic constraints), and outreach. The grant application kit defines funding eligibility requirements and details the application process. Appendixes contain the standard application form, a sample completed cover sheet, a budget detail worksheet, a list of State agencies and points of contact, and other information on how to apply for a grant.

AB  - Determined whether the clients of a nurse-led outreach program serving 39 rural, mentally ill, homebound elderly clients (mean age 79 yrs) used legal surrogate decision makers for health care and financial decisions. A record review revealed that almost half of the clients who had a surrogate decision maker used a power of attorney. Adult children were the most frequent family members named. Four records indicated that an adult child had been given a power of attorney and that the child had potentially abused the parent, either financially or physically. Implications for mental health nurses dealing with this vulnerable population are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Infants, children, and adolescents up to 19 years of age are at greater risk for foodborne illness than healthy adults because of their less-developed immune system, lower body weight, and limited control over their meal preparation. Based on focus group results, the objectives of this educational outreach were to: (1) develop on-line food safety newsletters for families with children 10 years and under on safe food handling practices relevant to this audience; and (2) develop online food safety newsletters and a podcast for mothers with infants on safe food handling practices relevant to infant feeding topics. A series of 15 newsletters for families with young children and 3 newsletters for mothers of infants was designed based on social marketing principles for electronic delivery. Newsletter topics were based on the FightBac! campaign, results from a focus group study of main food preparers in families with children 10 years of age and under, and results of a nationwide survey of main food preparers in families with children 10 years of age and under. Newsletters targeted for families with children 10 years of age and under were reviewed by an expert panel of food safety professionals and were revised using comments provided. Newsletters targeted to mothers with infants under 1 year of age were reviewed by an expert panel that included infant nutrition specialists and breastfeeding experts. The newsletters developed for families with children 10 years old and under were distributed to children in 3 midwestern schools (kindergarten-fifth grade) and 1 after-school program for inclusion in the regular take-home packets given to parents/ guardians by the child. A postcard evaluation containing questions on usefulness and an overall rating for the newsletter using a 4-point scale (1 = not very helpful to 4 = very helpful) was included. The podcast was evaluated via an electronic survey by an expert panel of infant nutrition specialists and breastfeeding experts. Recommended changes in wording and picture illustrations were used to revise the podcast. Access of the electronic newsletters was measured with social media metrics. Ratings by parents/guardians of the newsletters designed for families with young children were as follows: content, 3.6; reading ease, 3.9; appearance, 3.8; and an overall rating of 3.4. Participants commented on the helpfulness of newsletter content. Evaluation of the podcast by an expert panel indicated that it was appropriate for the target audience and the content was relevant. Reaching families with children 10 years of age and under and mothers of infants to provide food safety messages can be challenging. Education materials for electronic media can be designed to address knowledge gaps identified by research findings. These newsletters and the podcast that were developed and evaluated provide helpful, appropriate, and relevant food safety information needed by the target audience.

AB  - Objectives. We sought to determine whether field outreach with motivational interviewing, as compared with traditional field outreach, leads to increases in HIV counseling and testing and rates of return for test results among young African American men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods. In a randomized, 2-group, repeated-measures design, 96 young African American MSM completed a motivational interviewing — based field outreach session and 92 young African American MSM completed a traditional field outreach session. The percentages of participants agreeing to traditional HIV counseling and testing (an oral swab of the cheek) and returning for test results were the primary outcome measures. Results. More of the participants in the motivational interviewing condition than the control condition received HIV counseling and testing (49% versus 20%; x[sub 2]1 = 17.94; P=.000) and returned for test results (98% versus 72%; x[sub 2]1 = 10.22; P=.001). Conclusions. The addition of motivational interviewing to field outreach is effective in encouraging high-risk young African American MSM to learn their HIV status. Also, peer outreach workers can be effectively trained to reduce health disparities by providing evidence-based brief counseling approaches targeting high-risk minority populations.

AB  - Reviews the value of descriptive alcohol surveys that have traditionally been used to provide data about student drinking patterns and problems and to assess the need for programming efforts. Other potential contributions of survey research are discussed, such as their use in understanding and addressing the causes and mechanisms by which students develop problems of alcohol abuse. It is suggested that data regarding students' perceptions of peer norms as well as personal attitudes toward alcohol use are important in noting misperceptions of alcohol use in student environments and may be integrated into alcohol education to influence drinking behavior. Also, first-hand participation in this type of survey may be a consciousness-raising catalyst among students by helping them to examine their own consumption behaviors and the influences of peers. Examples from an ongoing project connected with counseling and educational outreach activities in an undergraduate college community are reported, and it is suggested that alcohol abuse programs in various peer intensive environments may find that periodic surveys of constituencies can enhance and contribute to more traditional counseling and education efforts.

AB  - In northern Nigeria, over 80% of the unskilled and uneducated adolescent street boys, or "Almajiris", are from the ethnic Hausa-Fulani tribes. They depend on street begging and menial jobs for daily survival. In dealing with the situation, state vocational centers were established as the Millennium Hope Project (MHP) to provide the boys with trades and skills for self-reliance and socioeconomic transformations. This article presents findings from an educational policy evaluation research study of the MHP implementation and outcomes. The research was based on an ethnographic approach using multimodal data derived from interviews and observations and data analysis-involved transcription, categorization, and coding. Major themes include the cultural identities and statuses of the boys, curriculum implementation and management of the project, socioeconomic transformation of learning outcome, and the challenges and positive impacts of the MHP on the boys. The themes are discussed using the boys' "voices" and pertinent literature. The conclusion includes educational policy remedies for future reforms and modification of the project.

AB  - This dissertation presents an ethnography of youth in Liberia and of how their lives became affected by a civil war which raged in the country between 1990 and 1997. The focus is on the experiences, motivations, and reflections of young combatants who fought for a variety of rebel factions. For these young people, the daily prospect of poverty, joblessness and marginalisation effectively blocked the paths to a normal adulthood; drawing them instead into a subculture of liminality, characterised by abjection, resentment and rootlessness. As opportunity came, their voluntary enlistment into one of the several rebel armies of the civil war therefore became an attractive option for many. Based upon one year of fieldwork during 1998, conducted among groups of ex-combatant youths in both the capital Monrovia and in a provincial town in the rural hinterland, I describe and analyse the young people’s own accounts of their involvement in the civil war; their complicity in atrocities, their coping strategies in the context of armed conflict, their position as ex-combatants in a post-war environment, and their outlook on their past, present and future.In the first chapter I set the scene of the Liberian civil war and discuss the central concepts on which my dissertation is built. Chapter two then takes up the methodological issues relating to the particular fieldwork conditions found. This is done by providing an account of my participant observation within a volatile community of ex-combatants in Monrovia. Chapter three deals with the nature of pre-civil war Liberian political and military organisational structures and their rootedness in pre-state institutions such as local warlordism and secret societies. In chapter four I look at the cultural setting of my fieldwork and track elements found within the legacy of violence, to oral literature and patterns of socialisation. Chapter five focuses specifically on the role and predicament of young women in the civil war. Whilst some became active fighters, most participated as auxiliaries in various capacities. Their accounts convey not only the tremendous hardship and suffering, but also reveal mechanisms which helped at least some to survive. In chapter six I discuss the question of a post-war reintegration of ex-combatants into peacetime society and show that the prospects of different groups depend primarily on their social and geographical situation, rather than on the negligible effectiveness of aid programmes routinely executed by international organisations and NGOs.

AB  - This exploratory study examined family preservation services provided to Asian-American and Euro-American clients of the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. The case data of two subgroups of Asian-Americans (Cambodian-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans) were also examined. The results indicated the following significant findings: Asian American parents were generally older than the comparison group; Asian-American fathers were more likely to be in the home; substance abuse was less likely to be a problem for Asian-American parents; health care services were used more by Euro-American clients; In-Home Outreach Counseling was used more frequently by Asian-Americans. No significant differences existed between the two subgroups examined. An additional finding was that a majority of the 21 services that are part of Family Preservation Programs were not being utilized by clients. Possible explanations for this finding are that the services were not needed or were not actually being offered.

AB  - Deaths attributable to natural heat exposure, although generally considered preventable (1), represent a continuing public health concern in the United States. During 2004-2018, an average of 702 heat-related deaths occurred in the United States annually. To study patterns in heat-related deaths by age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and level of urbanization, and to explore comorbid conditions associated with deaths resulting from heat exposure, CDC analyzed nationally comprehensive mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).* The rate of heat-related mortality tended to be higher among males, persons aged ≥65 years, non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, and persons living in noncore nonmetropolitan and large central metropolitan counties. Natural heat exposure was a contributing cause of deaths attributed to certain chronic medical conditions and other external causes. Preparedness and response initiatives directed toward extreme heat events, currently underway at local, state, and national levels, can contribute to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with natural heat exposure. Successful public health interventions† to mitigate heat-related deaths include conducting outreach to vulnerable communities to increase awareness of heat-related symptoms and provide guidance for staying cool and hydrated, particularly for susceptible groups at risk such as young athletes and persons who are older or socially isolated (2). Improved coordination across various health care sectors could inform local activities to protect health during periods of high heat. For instance, jurisdictions can monitor weather conditions and syndromic surveillance data to guide timing of risk communication and other measures (e.g., developing and implementing heat response plans, facilitating communication and education activities) to prevent heat-related mortality in the United States. CDC also recommends that federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions open cooling centers or provide access to public locations with air conditioning for persons in need of a safe, cool, environment during hot weather conditions. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, CDC updated its guidance on the use of cooling centers to provide best practices (e.g., potential changes to staffing procedures, separate areas for persons with symptoms of COVID-19, and physical distancing) to reduce the risk for introducing and transmitting SARS COV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into cooling centers.§.

AB  - The ethnography examines the different roles of epigenetics in both new scientific thinking and within clinical trials that test nutritional interventions on pregnant women deemed obese. Contrary to commonly held assumptions that underlie genetic determinism, epigenetics represents a paradigmatic shift through the study of how environmental conditions affect gene regulation. Research and prevention efforts around the growing public concern for childhood and adult obesity have recently shifted focus to a new population: pregnant women. Epigenetic science claims that women who are obese during pregnancy have a higher chance of having children who develop obesity and diabetes in adulthood. In the case of obesity during pregnancy, epigenetic researchers worry that a pregnant woman's diet and overall health may affect not only the health of her unborn child, but also the genetic development of future generations. My ethnography follows scientists as they navigate through the new epigenetic paradigm and investigate the effects of dietary interventions on obese pregnant women. This project involved sixteen months of multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork, carried out between 2012 and 2014. I completed participant observation and interviews at two randomized clinical trials: the SmartStart trial in the United States and the StandUp trial in the United Kingdom. Both trials use epigenetic theories to test the efficacy of prenatal interventions. However, each trial uses different diet and exercise interventions on pregnant women. While the US trial implements a behavioral intervention that focuses on weight gain and calorie control, the UK trial emphasizes the need to control sugar consumption during pregnancy. Both trials also follow up with the participants' children to evaluate the effects of the prenatal interventions on the children's early development. I actively participated in the SmartStart trial in the US as a nutritional counselor and volunteer staff member. I was responsible for delivering the dietary intervention, recruitment, and data collection practices. At the StandUp trial in the UK, I observed twenty-four intervention visits and over twenty different data collection visits, as well as monthly staff meetings and weekly conference calls. The ethnography juxtaposes the justification and design of the clinical trials on behalf of the staff and scientists, with the experiences of the pregnant participants. By examining the application of dietary prenatal interventions in contemporary science ethnographically, I aim to interrupt a pattern of thinking in which women's bodies are the inevitable targets of intervention to address future epidemics. Throughout the ethnography I examine themes related to how epigenetic science has influenced notions of the environment, 'good mothering,' 'healthy eating,' and the future risk of disease. In the ethnography I argue that individualizing dietary responsibility solely on the mothers obscures the social, gendered, and environmental factors that also influence their behavior and health. My findings show that epigenetic science is not a homogenous or monolithic paradigm. Rather, different scientists are applying particular aspects of epigenetics, which contribute to what I call the proliferation of epigenetic adaptations.

AB  - HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS across the United States are funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct street outreach to facilitate risk reduction among a variety of hard-to-reach populations who are at risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. The interaction between the client and outreach worker is the fundamental element of any street outreach activity. However, little has been written about the relationships that develop on the street between workers and clients to promote, support, and sustain behavior change. This paper describes two types of interactions that occur in street outreach intervention activities: the contact and the encounter. As part of a comprehensive evaluation of street outreach, interactions between workers and clients were described and analyzed during the formative phase of the AIDS Evaluation of Street Outreach Projects. For purposes of the evaluation, a contact was defined as a face-to-face interaction during which materials and/or information are exchanged between an outreach worker and a client (or small group of clients). An encounter was defined as a face-to-face interaction between a worker and client going beyond the contact to include individual assessment, specific service delivery in response to the client's identified need(s), and a planned follow-up. The contact provides a means to initiate interaction with potential clients in the community. It is the encounter that provides more significant opportunity for helping the client initiate and sustain behavior change. The discussion suggests techniques for enhancing the encounter between outreach workers and clients using the conceptual framework of the social work helping relationship. Five elements of the encounter are defined and developed: screening, engagement, assessment, service delivery, and follow-up. The encounter represents an enhancement of the traditional street outreach interaction and a more systematic approach to promoting the behavioral change goals of the AIDS Evaluation of Street Outreach Projects. Recommendations are suggested for implementing the encounter in street outreach programs serving hard-to-reach populations.

AB  - Summary: Former inmates encounter a variety of challenges when returning to their community, including poor health status and limited access to healthcare services. This qualitative study examined how former male inmates with chronic conditions perceived, understood, managed, and coped with their illnesses. Findings: The participants were Black and Puerto Rican, with a mean age of 47 years, who were interviewed within three years of their release. Participants reported at least one chronic condition, with 21 HIV-negative men using chaos narratives to depict their approach to disease management. Nine HIV-positive men used quest narratives to present their illnesses and were immediately linked to supportive services, enabling them to overcome the barriers to community reintegration. Applications: Health interventions in the area of forensic social work ought to focus on conducting Medicaid outreach and enrollment efforts prior to correctional facility discharge.

AB  - Examined validity of self-reported drug use as a measure of behavior change for the evaluation of drug use prevention and HIV risk reduction programs. Urinalysis results from 154 Ss in 4 cities are compared to responses to questions about drug use in the past 48 hrs from the National Institute on Drug Abuse's Risk Behavior Assessment. Urinalysis and self-reports agreed for 86.3% of those reporting use of cocaine and 84.9% for heroin users. The percentage reporting drug use and testing negative was somewhat higher than the percentage reporting no use and testing positive for both cocaine and heroin. Results suggest that self-reported drug use in not-in-treatment, noninstitutionalized populations is accurate enough for measuring changes in risk behavior practices, suggesting that urinalysis may not be necessary if respondents are asked about their drug use in a nonthreatening manner and are assured of confidentiality.

AB  - Background. Despite the increasing development of early intervention services for psychosis, little is known about their cost-effectiveness. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of Outreach and Support in South London (OASIS), a service for people with an at-risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis. Method. The costs of OASIS compared to care as usual (CAU) were entered in a decision model and examined for 12- and 24-month periods, using the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and rate of transition to psychosis as key parameters. The costs were calculated on the basis of services used following referral and the impact on employment. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of all the assumptions made in the model. Results. Over the initial 12 months from presentation, the costs of the OASIS intervention were £1872 higher than CAU. However, after 24 months they were £961 less than CAU. Conclusions. This model suggests that services that permit early detection of people at high risk of psychosis may be cost saving.

Adjusted polychotomous logistic regression analyses and multivariate models (via SUDAAN) constructed separately, revealed a significant race by gender interaction for each race-gender group. Age of first intercourse (≤13), two or more lifetime sexual intercourse partners, alcohol/drug use before last intercourse, no use of contraception at last intercourse, being forced to have sex, forcing someone to have sex, and having beaten up a date in the last 12 months and having been beaten up by a date (in last 12 months) were associated (p = .05) with reduced life satisfaction. Measures of life satisfaction as a component of comprehensive assessments of adolescent sexual risk-taking behaviors in fieldwork, research, and program-evaluation efforts should be considered.

AB  - Relationships between perceived life satisfaction, poor mental health, suicide ideation and suicide behaviors were examined in a statewide sample of 13 to 18 year old public high school students (n = 4,758) using the self-report CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Adjusted logistic regression analyses and multivariate models constructed separately (via SUDAAN), revealed that poor mental health (past 30 days), poor mental/physical health (past 30 days) serious suicide consideration (past 12 months), planning for suicide (past 12 months), attempted suicide (past 12 months) and suicide attempt requiring medical care (past 12 months) were significantly related to reduced life satisfaction. Also, differences across gender and race were demonstrated. Measures of life satisfaction as a component of comprehensive assessments of adolescent mental health, suicide ideation and suicide behavior in fieldwork, research, and program-evaluation efforts should be considered.

AB  - ABSTRACT: This study explored relationships between perceived life satisfaction and physical activity behaviors in a statewide sample of adolescents in South Carolina (n = 4,758) using the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the Brief Multidimensional Student Life Satisfaction Scale (BMSLSS). Adjusted logistic regression analyses and multivariate models constructed separately revealed significant race by gender results. Not exercising for 20 minutes over the past 7 days (sweating and hard breathing), not performing stretching exercising (past 7 days), not exercising to strengthen or tone muscles (past 7 days), spending < 20 minutes actually exercising or playing sports in PE class, not playing on sport teams run by school, and not playing on sport teams run by outside school organizations were associated (p = .05) with reduced life satisfaction for specific race/gender groups. Results suggest implications for school and community-based physical activity programs. Future research should consider measures of life satisfaction as a component of comprehensive assessments of adolescent physical activity behaviors in fieldwork, research, and program evaluation.

AB  - We explored relationships between violent behaviors and perceived life satisfaction among 2,138 middle school students in a southern state using the CDC Middle School Youth Risk Behavior Survey (MSYRBS) and the Brief Multidimensional Student Life Satisfaction Scale (BMSLSS). Logistic regression analyses and multivariate models constructed separately revealed significant race by gender results. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the variables of interest. Having ever carried a gun, ever carried a knife/club, physical fighting and physical fighting with need for medical treatment were associated (p ≤ .05) with reduced life satisfaction for specific race/gender groups, while controlling for SES and grade. Results suggest implications for school-community based violence prevention programs. Future research should consider measures of life satisfaction as a component of comprehensive assessments of middle school student violence and aggressive behaviors in fieldwork, intervention research and program evaluation.

AB  - ABSTRACT BACKGROUND In this cross-sectional study we explored relationships between aggressive and violent behaviors and emotional self-efficacy (ESE) in a statewide sample of public high school adolescents in South Carolina (N = 3836). METHODS The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Youth Risk Behavior Survey items on aggressive and violent behavior items and an adolescent ESE scale were used. Logistic regression analyses and multivariate models constructed separately, revealed significant race by sex findings. RESULTS Results suggest that carrying a weapon to school (past 30 days) and being threatened or injured with a gun, knife, or club at school (past 12 months) were significantly associated (p < .05) with reduced ESE for specific race/sex groups. CONCLUSIONS Results have implications for school- and community-based mental health services and social and emotional learning and aggression/violence prevention programs for adolescents. Measures of ESE as a component of comprehensive assessments of adolescent mental health, social and emotional learning and aggressive/violent behaviors in fieldwork, research, and program-evaluation efforts should be considered.

AB  - We used four methods (direct count, indirect count, wisdom of the crowd, and unique object multiplier) to map and estimate the population size of street children in six major cities in Iran in 2017. In aggregate for the six cities, the number of street children was estimated at 5296 (interquartile range [IQR] 4122-7071) using the median of the four methods. This corresponds to a rate of 16.3 (IQR 12.5-24.5) per 10,000 children age 5-18 years old, or 3.2 (IQR 2.4-5.3) per 10,000 total population. The total number for street children in the country is estimated at 26,000 (IQR 20,239-34,719) children. Results can help policy-makers advocate for resources, plan programs, and evaluate the reach of programs for street children.

AB  - Dutch politicians claim that disorder and nuisance in the public domain have grown out of hand in deprived areas and that local inhabitants call for more repression. Recently, new administrative measures were introduced to tackle these issues more effectively, some of which were almost exact copies of British measures like the ASBO. Studies on ASB have usually focused on general views among the population. The present qualitative research studies the assumptions that the situation with respect to ASB has got out of hand and that the call for repression is dominant amongst local inhabitants. It is based on intensive fieldwork including observations and over 300 qualitative interviews with social workers, policemen, troublemakers themselves, and residents of 11 so-called problem neighbourhoods in four major Dutch cities. The study shows a more nuanced and mixed local public discourse on this policy landscape than politicians would like us to believe.

AB  - The number of older homeless people with a limited life expectancy is increasing. European studies on their health‐related characteristics are lacking. This study compared self‐reported health, healthcare service use and health‐related needs of older and younger homeless people in the Netherlands. It is part of a cohort study that followed 513 homeless people in the four major Dutch cities for a period of 2.5 years, starting from the moment they registered at the social relief system in 2011. Using cross‐sectional data from 378 participants who completed 2.5‐year follow‐up, we analysed differences in self‐reported health, healthcare service use, and health‐related needs between homeless adults aged ≥50 years (N = 97) and <50 years (N = 281) by means of logistic regression. Results show that statistically significantly more older than younger homeless people reported cardiovascular diseases (23.7% versus 10.3%), visual problems (26.8% versus 14.6%), limited social support from family (33.0% versus 19.6%) and friends or acquaintances (27.8% versus 14.6%), and medical hospital care use in the past year (50.5% versus 34.5%). Older homeless people statistically significantly less often reported cannabis (12.4% versus 45.2%) and excessive alcohol (16.5% versus 27.0%) use in the past month and dental (20.6% versus 46.6%) and mental (16.5% versus 25.6%) healthcare use in the past year. In both age groups, few people reported unmet health‐related needs. In conclusion, compared to younger homeless adults, older homeless adults report fewer substance use problems, but a similar number of dental and mental problems, and more physical and social problems. The multiple health problems experienced by both age groups are not always expressed as needs or addressed by healthcare services. Older homeless people seem to use more medical hospital care and less non‐acute, preventive healthcare than younger homeless people. This vulnerable group might benefit from shelter‐based or community outreach programmes that proactively provide multidisciplinary healthcare services.

AB  - Introduction: Vaccination is an important tool in hepatitis B prevention. However, several vaccine doses are required to induce long-term protection. Several at-risk groups have difficulties in adhering to the standard vaccination schedule. Objectives: This paper aims to review the use of accelerated hepatitis B vaccination schedules, in terms of immunogenicity and compliance. Results: Accelerated schedules (0.1.2.12 months) or super-accelerated schedules (0.7.21.360 days) have been shown to result in higher proportions of healthy vaccinees reaching anti-HBs antibody levels ⩾ 10 IU/I more rapidly. A fourth completing dose is required to lift antibody levels to an equal height, as does a standard (0.1 .6 months) schedule. Accelerated schedules do also increase the uptake of hepatitis B vaccine, that is the proportion of vaccinees who receive three doses. However, completing the schedule with a fourth dose is usually more difficult than completing a standard 0.1.6-month schedule. Several additional tools can help to increase the compliance (eg, reminder systems, outreach services and incentive schemes). Conclusion: For rapid seroconversion and almost immediate protection in the short term, a (super)accelerated schedule could be used in at-risk groups. As long-term protection data with these (super) accelerated schedules have not been documented yet, a fourth dose at month 12 is still required. A shortened schedule (0.1 .4 months) might be an alternative worth considering compared with the standard 0.1 .6, as it convenes to internationally accepted minimum dose intervals and offers earlier protection. There is a clear need to study the long-term protection and effectiveness of the primary part of (super)accelerated schedules.

AB  - Consumerism of image and performance enhancement drugs (IPEDs) is a world-wide public health concern. Given anecdotal reporting of increased normalisation of IPED use and uptake of British South Asian male IPED users at UK needle and syringe exchange services, the study aimed to explore use of IPEDs among this under-researched ethnic group. 20 in depth interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of British South Asian males attending harm reduction outreach in the North East of England. The interviews explored motives for use of IPEDs, sourcing routes, information seeking, injecting behaviours and cultural and community sensitivities around IPED use among this group. The data was collected and analysed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach (IPA). Motives for use centred on the achievement of enhanced definition and density of muscle, and improved recovery from training and injuries. All participants reported initial stimulation of interest and triggers to seek information on IPEDs due to social media, community and peer messages. Diverse forms of IPED use were described, with rational and moderated use common among older participants. In contrast younger participants adopted more excessive use in seeking short cuts to attaining muscle size. Sourcing of androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) and growth hormones from originating countries (Pakistan, India) was reported, along with diversification of entrepreneurial activity into IPED dealing networks. Sellers were generally reported to provide effective and reliable products and mentoring to inexperienced users. Group injecting practices were common. IPED use was observed by some as health promotion medium within religious contexts. Crime deterrence and drug abstinence occurred for some while involved in AAS cycles. The study is intended to contribute to health policy and practice debate around the targeting of dedicated education, outreach and harm reduction for ethnic groups engaged in IPED use.

AB  - Background: Adequate support for homeless populations includes shelter and care to recuperate from illness and/or injury. This is a descriptive analysis of diagnoses and use of shelter-based convalescence in a cohort of homeless adults in Amsterdam. Methods: Demographics of ill homeless adults, diagnoses, referral pattern, length of stay, discharge locations, and mortality, were collected by treating physicians during outreach care provision in a shelter-based convalescence care facility in Amsterdam, from January 2001 through October 2007. Results: 629 individuals accounted for 889 admissions to the convalescence care facility. 83% were male and 53% were born in the Netherlands. The mean age was 45 years (SD 10 years). The primary physical problems were skin disorders (37%), respiratory disorders (33%), digestive disorders (24%) and musculoskeletal disorders (21%). Common chronic conditions included addictions 78%, mental health disorders 20%, HIV/AIDS 11% and liver cirrhosis 5%. Referral sources were self-referred (18%), general hospitals (21%) and drug clinics (27%). The median length of stay was 20 days. After (self) discharge, 63% went back to the previous circumstances, 10% obtained housing, and 23% went to a medical or nursing setting. By March 2008, one in seven users (n = 83; 13%) were known to have died, the Standard Mortality Ratio was 7.5 (95% CI: 4.1-13.5). Over the years, fewer men were admitted, with significantly more self neglect, personality disorders and cocaine use. Lengths of stay increased significantly during the study period. Conclusion: Over the last years, the shelter-based convalescence care facility users were mainly homeless single males, around 45 years of age, with chronic problems due to substance use, mental health disorders and a frail physical condition, many of whom died a premature death. The facility has been flexible and responsive to the needs of the users and services available.

AB  - Background: To improve homelessness prevention practice, we met with recently homeless adults, to explore their pathways into homelessness, problems and service use, before and after becoming homeless. Methods: Recently homeless adults (last housing lost up to two years ago and legally staying in the Netherlands) were sampled in the streets, day centres and overnight shelters in Amsterdam. In April and May 2004, students conducted interviews and collected data on demographics, self reported pathways into homelessness, social and medical problems, and service use, before and after becoming homeless. Results: among 120 recently homeless adults, (male 88%, Dutch 50%, average age 38 years, mean duration of homelessness 23 weeks), the main reported pathways into homelessness were evictions 38%, relationship problems 35%, prison 6% and other reasons 22%. Compared to the relationship group, the eviction group was slightly older (average age 39.6 versus 35.5 years; p = 0.08), belonged more often to a migrant group (p = 0.025), and reported more living single (p < 0,001), more financial debts (p = 0.009), more alcohol problems (p = 0.048) and more contacts with debt control services (p = 0.009). The relationship group reported more domestic conflicts (p < 0.001) and tended to report more drug (cocaine) problems. Before homelessness, in the total group, contacts with any social service were 38% and with any medical service 27%. Despite these contacts they did not keep their house. During homelessness only contacts with social work and benefit agencies increased, contacts with medical services remained low. Conclusion: the recently homeless fit the overall profile of the homeless population in Amsterdam: single (Dutch) men, around 40 years, with a mix of financial debts, addiction, mental and/or physical health problems. Contacts with services were fragmented and did not prevent homelessness. For homelessness prevention, systematic and outreach social medical care before and during homelessness should be provided.

AB  - <bold>Background and Rationale: </bold>The availability of urine based testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) provides a unique opportunity to screen for these pathogens outside traditional clinical settings. The researchers investigated the feasibility of street based CT/GC screening in the context of an outreach programme among street/homeless adolescents in Denver.<bold>Objectives: </bold>To describe the integration of urine based CT/GC screening into an existing outreach programme among street/homeless youths and the yield of CT/GC testing in this setting.<bold>Methods: </bold>The Denver Department of Public Health (DPH) collaborated with outreach staff from Urban Peak (a community based organisation serving street/homeless youths in Denver) to offer urine based CT/GC testing to males and females in street settings. Tests were conducted on the street in areas where street/homeless youths congregate.<bold>Results: </bold>Urban Peak outreach staff were trained by DPH staff to conduct CT testing, process urine specimens, and provide test results to participating youths. DPH remained responsible for treatment of people with CT or GC infection as well as CT/GC case reporting. CT testing started in January 2000; GC testing was added in July 2000. Throughout April 2002 a total of 414 CT and 302 GC tests were conducted, respectively 11.6% and 2.7% of which were positive. Among first testers, 13.0% were positive for CT and 3.7% for GC.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>CT/GC urine testing can be incorporated into existing outreach programmes without considerable extra effort. Overall CT rates were high and suggest the need for ongoing screening in this manner.<bold>Learning Objective: </bold>To understand the role of CT/GC screening in the context of services provided to street/homeless youths in outreach settings.

AB  - Introduction: Many people at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), e.g., men who have sex with men (MSM), are not optimally reached by current sexual health care systems with testing. To facilitate testing by home-based sampling or sampling in outreach setting we evaluated dried blood spots (DBS), a method for self-collected blood sampling for serological screening of HIV, hepatitis B (HBV) and syphilis. The aims of this study were to assess the acceptability and feasibility of self-collected DBS and to compare the test results for screening of HIV, HBV and syphilis from DBS with blood drawn by venous puncture. Methods: DBS were collected from men who have sex with men (MSM), visiting the STI clinic of the public health service South Limburg (n = 183) and HIV positive and HBV positive patients (n = 34), visiting the outpatient clinics of the Maastricht University Medical Centre in the period January 2012–April 2015. The 93 first participating MSM visiting the STI clinic were asked to fill in a questionnaire about the feasibility and acceptability about self-collection of DBS in a setting without going to a health care facility and were asked to collect the DBS themselves. Serological screening tests for HIV (HIV combi PT, Roche), HBV (HBsAg, Roche) and syphilis (Treponema pallidum Ig, Biokit 3.0) were performed on DBS and on blood drawn by venous puncture, which was routinely taken for screening. Results: In total 217 participants were included in the study with a median age of 40 years (range between 17–80). Of MSM 84% agreed that it was clear and easy to do the finger-prick, while 53% agreed that it was clear and easy to apply the blood onto the DBS card. Also, 80% of MSM would use the bloodspot test again. In 91% (198) of DBS, sufficient material was collected to perform the three tests. No difference was observed in DBS quality between self-collected DBS and health care worker collected DBS. For HIV (n = 195 DBS-serum pairs) sensitivity and specificity were 100%. For HBV the sensitivity for HBsAg (n = 202) was 90% and specificity was 99%. For syphilis (n = 191) the sensitivity of the DBS was 93% with a specificity of 99%. Analysis of the DBS of HIV positive participants (n = 38) did show similar test performance for HBV and syphilis as in HIV negatives. Conclusion: DBS is an acceptable self-sampling method for MSM, as there was no difference in DBS quality in self-collected and health care worker collected DBS. Test performance, i.e., its high sensitivity (>90%) and specificity (>99%) measures show that DBS is a valid alternative for venous blood puncture. Especially when DBS is combined with home-collected sampling for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, complete STI screening can be done in outreach setting and/or home-collected sampling in MSM.

AB  - Abstract: This paper adopts a qualitative case study on the generalist service delivery model of I‐Care, a Durban‐based non‐governmental organization that works with male street children. Fifteen face‐to‐face interviews were conducted with 10 I‐Care employees and 5 former street children. A focus group was set up with I‐Care employees. Although existing literature is forthright about a generalist approach for children at risk, it remains unclear how to implement this approach in practice. This paper reviews a continuity of 5 fundamental social work practices for working with street children: (a) outreach work, (b) child–family and child–community mediation, (c) transitory care centres and programmes, (d) brokerage, and (e) mentorship and follow‐ups. The study analyses how these practices contribute to the capability and agency expansion of the street children and outlines challenges that service providers and former street children experience. The main challenges acknowledged are balancing between the agency and protection of street children and the adaptation of children to street life. The study proposes intervention strategies to overcome these challenges.

AB  - Homelessness among veterans has dropped dramatically since the expansion of services for homeless veterans in 2009, and now engaging homeless veterans in existing programs will be important to continuing to make progress. While one promising approach for engaging homeless veterans in care is involving peer mentors in integrated services, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may diminish the effects of peer mentorship. This mixed methods study examined how interpersonal and emotional processes in homeless veterans with and without PTSD impacted their capacity to engage in relationships with peer mentors. Four focus groups of 5–8 homeless male veterans (N = 22) were drawn from a larger multisite randomized trial. Qualitative analysis identified five primary themes: disconnectedness; anger, hostility, or resentment; connecting with others; positive view of self; and feeling like an outsider. Thematic comparisons between participants with and without a self-reported PTSD diagnosis, and between those who did and did not benefit from the peer mentor program, were validated by using quantitative methods. Disconnectedness was associated with self-reported PTSD diagnosis and with lack of program benefit; feeling like an outsider was associated with program benefit. Results suggest that disruption to the capacity to develop and maintain social bonds in PTSD may interfere with the capacity to benefit from peer mentorship. Social rules and basic strategies for navigating interpersonal relationships may differ somewhat within the homeless community and outside of it; for veterans who feel disconnected from the domiciled community, a formerly homeless veteran peer may serve as a critical 'bridge' between the two social worlds.

AB  - Abstract: The 29 September 2009 South Pacific tsunami has had a lasting impact upon local coastal villages and global collaborative research efforts. Locally, the impact of the tsunami is one of the most severe disasters Samoa has experienced in the last several decades. Within one week of the event, 143 people died. Approximately 6000 traumatized men, women and children – terrified of the sea – refused to return to live or work in their rural, coastal villages, which in turn has had broad consequences for humanitarian emergency relief distribution networks and early recovery planning efforts. Researchers came from all over the world to participate in the UNESCO International Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Samoa International Tsunami Survey Team (ITST). Focusing on the need for interdisciplinary research, for the first time, a social impact assessment team (SIT) was expressly invited to participate. Within days of the tsunami, a group of Australian, New Zealand, American, Fijian, and Japanese disaster researchers began to discuss how they might develop a social science reconnaissance research plan using innovative approaches and best practice. This paper presents an overview of challenges faced by the social impact assessment team with a focus on lessons to be learnt from this experience. We discuss the need to clarify project boundaries, develop a core research agenda and project milestones, and develop day-to-day fieldwork work plans and at the same time be sensitive to the emotional needs of the interviewees as well as the researchers. We also make several practical suggestions for future social reconnaissance research with a set of recommendations to support disaster researchers as they plan their own research projects. The inclusion of a social impacts assessment group within a UNESCO-IOC ITST was a valuable response to the increasing need for responsible social research in sensitive topics of post-disaster analysis. Social scientists are aware that disaster social science research should not be a risk to the public, and that misconduct in such work should be avoided as far as possible. We believe that the inclusion of social science experts will revolutionise conceptual, methodological and empirical approaches in future ITSTs. Social scientists will provide unprecedented volumes of high quality information on post-disaster movements, communication and response activities by individuals, communities, private and public sectors — because social scientists are concerned about the integrity of the research process and results. Building upon our experiences, future ITSTs may tap into the potential that social science has to transform ITST''s capacity to gather information about disaster preparedness, what tsunami survivors saw, heard and experienced, and to reconstruct the socio-economic and political dynamics of affected communities. This paper contributes to the limited literature that outlines how to develop responsible plans and processes for post-tsunami disaster work; and, it furthers a line of inquiry applicable to a wide variety of hazards, such as flooding, cyclones, earthquakes, bushfires, pandemics and terrorism.

AB  - Objective: To review the relation between drug use, sexual risk behaviour, and STDs including HIV in two marginalised populations-drug users and street youth. Methods: A review of recent medical and behavioural literature focusing on illustrative examples from industrialised countries. Findings: Injecting and other illicit drug users and street. youth are both sexually active populations with a high rate of partner turnover and frequently exchange sex for money or drugs. Both STDs and HIV are prevalent among injecting and crack using individuals. Drug use may lead drug users to be less aware of or concerned about STD symptoms than others with STDs and thus increase the threshold for attending clinical services. Conclusions: Given that STDs facilitate the transmission of HN and that standard STD control programmes in general do not reach these populations, it is argued that drug users and street youth require targeted special outreach STD control programmes.

AB  - Many high school students living in poverty or who have limited support networks at home and school find the college or workforce preparation and application process to be a daunting, unattainable goal because of the academic and social challenges they face on a daily basis. Despite many federal and state financial aid incentives, specialized college preparation programs, and university sponsored activities for impoverished high school students, less than 50% of American students living on or under the poverty line go to a post secondary institution after high school, compared to 80% of students from the country’s most affluent homes (Baum & Ma, 2007). Academic deficits of first-generation can be one of many predictors why first-generation, economically disadvantaged high school students are not successful in attending college or work force institutions. Lack of motivation, performance vulnerability, negative selfimage, cultural isolation, and lack of support from peers, family members, and teachers can be the primary reasons why many first-generation students choose not to pursue a post-secondary education or workforce program (Baum & Ma, 2007). Although there are many factors which hinder college and workforce training for first-generation students, educational outreach, pre-collegiate advising, and mentoring by career professionals have the potential to increase first-generation, economically disadvantaged high school students’ career and college readiness. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the effectiveness of a high school college and career preparation program and how it influenced economically disadvantaged first-generation, college bound high school students in a Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The qualitative study examined whether or not high school 12th - grade students in the subgroup were more inclined or motivated in applying to colleges and workforce development programs, and being accepted to higher education institutions after they participated in a college/career readiness program. The study determined that social, human, and cultural capital in the form of support networks such as family, friends, school faculty, and community members influenced participants’ decisions to pursue a college or workforce program. Furthermore, the qualitative research study concluded that targeted college or workforce readiness programs and college preparation activities increased the number of students in the research sample who applied and intended on enrolling in post-secondary educational programs after high school. Local policy makers may use the results of the study as an evaluative measure to determine if the college and career readiness program is effectively meeting the goals and expectations of the school district when serving first-generation, low socioeconomic high school students. Secondly, school administration and the school board of the participating school district may use the results of the study to determine if the school system should continue to financially support the college and career readiness program in the future. Furthermore, the findings of the research from the participating school district may encourage other school districts, community agencies, and policy makers to improve college and workforce readiness practices as well as instructional programming procedures which address specific academic and sociological needs of first-generation, college bound students. Finally, other school districts in the area may use the findings of the study as a guide in the decision making and the execution of future K-16 educational initiatives, college preparation programs, or when following secondary policy guidelines established by the reauthorization of the federal Higher Education Act of 2003 (Department of Education, 2013).

AB  - The four victimagogic ideologies within the victims movement are the care ideology, which holds that the community should carry the burden of severe hardship on individual citizens; the rehabilitation ideology, which reasons that the state should, in so far as possible, restore crime victims to their states before crimes; the retributive ideology, which holds that victims deserve justice; and the abolitionist ideology, which supports civil proceedings for the resolution of offender-victim conflicts. The first wave of global trends in the victims movement since 1960 consisted of state victim compensation and initiatives by probation officers (1965-75). The second wave involved the establishment of rape crisis centers, shelter homes, and victim support schemes (VSS) (1975-80). The third wave has involved the institutionalization of victims support and the call for justice (1980-87). In the third wave, guided by the care ideology and the retributive ideology, the victims movement has been successful in expanding victim assistance across North American and Europe and improving the victim's position in the framework of criminal law. The author views the ideal victims program as a combination of a humanized criminal justice system and a network of outreaching VSS with a strong input from the local community.

AB  - The 1983 publication of A Nation at Risk has prompted many policymakers and educators to reform public schools to ensure that all students have equal access to higher education. As a result of these changes, many school districts across the country have chosen to implement a variety of college outreach programs not only to increase the number of students eligible to attend four year institutions but also to change the academic culture of the school. The context of this issue will be examined under a college preparatory program known as Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) which seeks to increase opportunities for minority or low socioeconomic students to enroll in four year universities by providing both social and academic support in rigorous courses. The qualitative case study seeks to address how the AVID program has impacted the culture of a low performing and low socioeconomic high school. A large urban, low performing high school in Southern California was selected for the case study. The school was selected because they have been designated as an AVID National Demonstration Site, which is the highest distinction within the program. The distinction indicates that the high school has achieved the highest standards for AVID implementation and expansion. The program has influenced policy and structural changes school wide. In addition, the success of the AVID program is highly contingent on a strong district and site leadership team to support staff members and students. Although the AVID program seeks to change the perceptions of teachers who have lower expectations of minority students, the data reveals that teacher's beliefs about minority student achievement and their access to college has not been altered. The overarching result is that the academic culture of the high school has changed drastically after the implementation of the AVID program. Both teachers and students strongly agree that the school has improved academically. This can by verified by improvements in standardized test scores for the past seven years, number of students taking both A-G required courses, and the increase in number of students attending a four year institution. One suggestion for future research is to conduct multiple case studies comparing and contrasting the successes and failures of high school AVID programs related to changing the academic culture. Findings from this case study indicate policy and practice implications such as, to provide extensive, specific, ongoing professional development for teachers on the AVID program methodologies and purpose, to provide all students access to A-G courses, and to ensure parents are involved and educated about the college going process.

AB  - As part of the Unified Health System (SUS) in Brazil, a Street Outreach Program was created with the goals of delivering primary health care (PHC) and guaranteeing access to health initiatives for homeless populations on the actual street environment, connecting these populations to other services beyond urgency and emergency facilities. The Program's scope of action involves, in addition to health care, protection against the risks to which this population is exposed combined with an effort to guarantee their rights. In this sense, the Street Outreach Clinics strive to ensure equity and access for a population without an address within a system that essentially relies on geographical catchment areas to provide health care. Thus, the establishment of Street Outreach Clinics has introduced new modes of providing health care, and consequently new modes of managing work processes. Based on this articulation between care and management, the present article discusses three levels of intervention at which the work of Street Outreach Clinics and teams takes place - the street itself, the health care unit, and institutional networks -, as well as the relationship between this Program and other PHC services and its contribution to reconcile PHC with its essential attributes, beyond catchment areas.

Su alcance involucra, además de la atención, la protección contra los riesgos a que está expuesta esa población, combinada con la búsqueda de la garantía de sus derechos. En ese sentido, los Consultorios en la Calle buscan hacer efectiva la equidad y el acceso a las acciones y servicios de salud para una población sin domicilio fijo dentro de un sistema basado esencialmente en la adscripción territorial de la población. Así, la creación del Consultorio en la Calle inaugura nuevos modos de cuidados de la salud y, en consecuencia, nuevos modos de gestionar el proceso de trabajo. A partir de esa articulación entre cuidado y gestión, el presente artículo discute tres planos de intervención donde se da la práctica de los equipos de Consultorio en la Calle (la propia calle, la sede o unidad de referencia y las redes institucionales), su relación con los demás servicios de atención primaria de salud y su contribución para reconciliar la atención primaria de la salud con sus atributos fundamentales, además de la adscripción del territorio geográfico.

AB  - Cambodia is recovering from three decades of violence. The Tonle Sap region is the poorest part of this deprived country. Its economy now suffers from substantial informal and destructive activities. A socio-economic analysis of the region -- a part of the Mekong River Commission's Water Utilization Programme, which serves the lower Mekong's Basin Development Plan (BDP) -- is documented. Besides the multifaceted collection and analysis of data and information from participatory fieldwork, various databases, mathematical models, expert interviews and so forth, a crucial part of the work is to build up and reinforce links between the Mekong River Commission, ministries, provincial authorities, non-governmental organizations, universities and ultimately local communities, and thereby root the BDP into the emerging civil society. Otherwise, the BDP is at high risk of sharing the fate of its predecessors on the Mekong as well as in many other parts of the world. This fate has too often been a failure of the plan, however integrated it has attempted to be.

AB  - My doctoral thesis, 'Belaboured Lives,' examines the relationship between Sunni Muslim women's reproductive and maternal health practices, Islamic conservatism, federal and non-governmental health programming, intense Shia-Sunni conflict, interpersonal enmity and 'occult' forces in Gilgit Town, the economic and administrative capital of Pakistan's semi-autonomous, federally-neglected and multi-sectarian Northern Areas. Over 14 months between 2004 and 2005, my doctoral ethnographic fieldwork involved research interviews and participant-observation among Sunni women and Gilgit Town's biomedical, traditional and Islamic therapeutic service providers, as well as in household, community, mosque and clinical-settings. With Gilgit District's maternal morbidity and mortality rate (MMR) being among the highest in Pakistan, my thesis argues that Gilgiti Sunni women's reproductive and maternal health outcomes were the product of restrictive, inter-linked or mutually interacting structural and ideological forces, which were socio-economic, political, familial and religious in nature. By providing an ethnography not only of women's home-centered health practices but also their experiences in clinical settings, I address the wide array of physical, symbolic and cosmological threats women perceived as being interwoven with their fertility, pregnancy and childbirth- related health. To different degrees and in different ways, women, their families and health providers described how the socio-spatial constraints associated with Islamic pardah (veiling, gender seclusion) and izzat (honor) paradigms, conflict-related service exclusions, iatrogenic risk and hospital funding insufficiencies, 'black magic' and spirit 'attacks' were contributory factors to women's poor health outcomes. But my participants' reproductive health was not only the arena for wellness-seeking and crisis resolution, but also for the enactment and expression of cultural values and sectarian identity; the tension between doctrinal Islam and local interpretations, modern/traditional divides; Sunni militarism; and symbolic and structural violence. Moreover, Gilgiti Sunni women's reproductive and maternal health narratives demonstrated subjectivity, inter-subjectivity and reflexivity, resistance and negotiation, and gendered and reproductive agency. Within this context, any one pregnancy could evidence and communicate multiple domains of experience, as well as patient-provider interaction, access to care, its quality and relation to socio-economic factors, ideological stance or community-bound interpersonal relations. Ultimately, by using pregnancy and childbirth as a central point of inquiry, my thesis examines different aspects of Gilgiti Sunni women's health experiences: biomedical and traditional; urban and rural childbirth and postpartum practices; Family Planning, fertility and infertility, unwanted pregnancies and abortions; conflict-related constraints; medical malpractice and cosmological harm.

AB  - Vascular mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical disease. Its prognosis includes not only onset of vascular dementia, but also death by cardiovascular disease. The vascular risk factors for vascular MCI are treatable, and appropriate treatment can prevent or delay the progression to dementia. Therefore, this group is an excellent candidate for secondary prevention. However, community-dwelling older adults with vascular MCI are often undetected and are not clinically identified until they develop frank dementia. Furthermore, older adults with undetected vascular MCI often have decreased ability to follow their medication regimens and this poor medication adherence worsens their vascular comorbidities. This vicious cycle needs to be prevented through community-based interventions. There is evidence that treatment of hypertension or diabetes mellitus could lead to a reduced incidence of vascular MCI and dementia. In this review article, we first explain the background and etiology of vascular MCI. We then summarize phenotype of subcortical vascular dementia which is often unrecognized or "hidden" in the community. Then we introduce the Osaki-Tajiri and Kurihara Projects which have been conducted in Northern Japan, as an example of prevention projects aimed to identify early-stage vascular MCI in the community, reduce the risk factors and facilitate their treatment. Early identification of vascular MCI in the community could lead to a large reduction in the dementia burden worldwide. The outreach efforts presented here could be useful in developing secondary prevention strategies targeted to vascular MCI.

AB  - Urban youth work in Asia faces tremendous challenges in trying to meet the needs of youths and enable them to cope more effectively with issues related to modernization. Some of the more common issues such as rural to urban migration, youth unemployment and underemployment, drug abuse and juvenile delinquency, sexual exploitation and erosion of moral values have to be addressed quickly and realistic long-term solutions found. Youth workers and youth organizations have to examine their organizational mission and discover more effective and efficient ways to deliver youth services. More importantly, youth organizations in urban settings have to move away from mainly a centre-based approach in service delivery to a more outreach emphasis. In doing so, urban youth work will be more dynamic and responsive to meet the needs of youths.

AB  - Nine Street Projects designed for the Spanish speaking and funded by Region V of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) are examined here. They were: the El Hogar del Nino Day Care Center, Spanish-American Day Care Center, United Migrant Opportunity Services' Bilingual/Bicultural Early Childhood Center, Youth Services at El Centro de la Causa, El Centro de la Causa Library Project, Talent Search - Latino, Project Venceremos, Latino Mental Health Outreach and Benito Juarez Health Clinic. The evaluation activities were intended to provide measures of operational effectiveness and to evaluate the relative impact of project services on service recipients. The evaluators gathered the information on which this evaluation was based through interviews with administrative staff and clients of the special projects, review of existing project records, interviews with project board members and staff members from referral agencies, and site visits. It was found that, as a general rule, the nine street projects were meeting needs and providing services to the Spanish speaking which otherwise were not available, or were perceived by the clients to be unavailable or at least inconvenient, to the program participants. For the most part, the street projects were ineffective in developing non-HEW support for program continuation expansions. (Author/JM)

AB  - The PARC model attempts to integrate existing services, when possible, by shifting the focus from the offender to the victim of crime. To prevent crime, the model would create a special unit that would be part of local police and sheriff departments, would deal specifically with victims and prevent revictimization, and would work with other agencies or organizations to adopt innovative techniques. The model would also provide assistance to victims through the office of the district attorney which would provide direct or referral services. Probation departments would administer restitution, and compensation would be provided by the State in cases where an offender is not apprehended or convicted or where a victim's financial loss is too large for the restitution contract. Implementation of the model would require both an attitudinal change and the development of cooperative, functional linkages between PARC agencies. Specific actions would include institutionalizing training sessions for police, probationers, and prosecutors; developing community awareness of victim-oriented services; coordinating regional or county-level meetings of PARC representatives; and introducing public outreach campaigns to publicize PARC.

AB  - This paper examines and compares the physical health of homeless people in samples from Madrid and Washington, D.C. The study used two random samples of people who met a definition of literal homelessness (i.e., no place to live or living in an emergency shelter) or who were considered at high risk of becoming homeless because they were using soup kitchens. The sample includes 289 people drawn during 1997 from shelters and soup kitchens in Madrid, and 908 people drawn during 1991 from shelters, soup kitchens, outdoor encampments, and the streets of the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Homeless individuals in Madrid were more likely to be male, older, and to have more extensive histories of homelessness. Though high in both, the Spanish and Americans samples had different rates of past year problems related to their respiratory system (40 percent vs. 53 percent), heart and circulatory system problems (22 percent vs. 23 percent), bone and muscle problems (25 percent vs. 18 percent), nervous system (11 percent vs. 13 percent), stomach and digestive system (18 percent vs. 12 percent), skin ulcers or rashes (15 percent vs. 11 percent), hepatitis and yellow jaundice (9 percent vs. 1 percent), AIDS, ARC or HIV (10 percent vs. 2 percent) sexually transmitted diseases (8 percent vs. 3 percent), and tuberculosis (3 percent vs. 1 percent). Although conducted in two very different countries, these studies demonstrate a high correlation between homelessness and health problems. In both samples, over 70 percent of the homeless people reported one or more significant health problems in the past year, and the rates of individual problems were several times higher than those in their respective household populations. The higher rates of HIV in the Spanish sample were attributed to the Spanish sanitary/health system's failure to provide HIV outreach, prevention and treatment. The paper concludes with a discussion of the importance of health services in programs for homeless people and other implications for local health care systems.

AB  - The objective of this article is to analyze the relationship between suffering from stressful life events (SLE) and subsequent suicidal behavior among women in a homeless situation, examining the differences in the number and characteristics of SLE experienced by attempters and nonattempters. The study was carried out based on the data obtained from a sample of women living homeless in Madrid (Spain; n = 138). The information was gathered using a structured interview. The results show that 46% of these women living homeless in Madrid had attempted suicide, and 32% of them had done so for the first time when they were homeless. We observed a high level of SLE among the women in a homeless situation, with a substantial increase in the number and severity of the stressors suffered by the interviewees who had attempted suicide, both during their childhood and adolescence and in their later lives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Public Policy Relevance Statement—Public Policy Relevance Statement This study reveals that suicide attempts among women living homeless in Madrid reaches alarming dimensions. Data obtained can be useful for policymakers’ design programs for the prevention of suicide in this group. It would be important for designing protocols for the early assessment of suicidal behavior for their implementation in both assistance services and by street outreach teams.

AB  - Migrant farmworkers are the most disadvantaged of minority groups, but their needs and problems go unnoticed and unmet in most communities. Mobility, language and cultural differences, and health and nutrition problems combine to produce negative effects on school achievement. An estimated 70 percent of adult migrants have not completed high school. Although migrant farmworkers include many ethnic groups, they share a certain life style and many behavioral patterns. Migrancy as a culture tends to produce similarities in sex role expectations, roles of adults and children, dealings with social institutions, feelings of powerlessness, and attitudes toward authority. These cultural traits have implications for the success of adult education programs. Following the failure of a residential program for migrant school dropouts, the University of Tennessee established high school equivalency (UT-HEP) programs at four sites with high concentrations of migrant farmworkers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. This outreach program has surpassed its enrollment target each year and attracted both recent dropouts and adults. Program success is attributed to student empowerment, accessibility, flexibility of class schedules, culturally and ethnically congruent recruiters and staff, availability of bilingual counseling, individualized plans, and ongoing assessment. Several UT-HEP graduates in western North Carolina helped found a migrant community center that provides legal assistance, housing assistance, literacy education, and cultural activities as well as improving relations between migrants and the larger community.

AB  - Notes that there is convincing evidence that homeless people have higher rates of both mental health and substance misuse problems than the general population, in addition to lowered access to services and other helping resources. It is proposed that a model of care which includes designated, well-trained, and well-supervised workers who can work effectively across the various domains of mental health, substance misuse, and housing will be the main future direction. The author argues that it is important to adopt a holistic (and pragmatic) view as to what the targets of treatment should be, and that therapists need very high levels of skill in engagement. In addition, the assessment of co-existing mental health and alcohol/other drug use problems in people who are also homeless should follow a similar process as for other clients. However, there are important individual barriers and organizational issues that need to be addressed. The author concludes by suggesting that there are four areas from which treatment ideas can be drawn: substance misuse, mental health generally, assertive outreach in particular, and housing.

AB  - The vast majority of high school students aspire to some kind of postsecondary education, yet far too many of them enter college without the basic content knowledge, skills, or habits of mind they need to succeed. Andrea Venezia and Laura Jaeger look at the state of college readiness among high school students, the effectiveness of programs in place to help them transition to college, and efforts to improve those transitions. Students are unprepared for postsecondary coursework for many reasons, the authors write, including differences between what high schools teach and what colleges expect, as well as large disparities between the instruction offered by high schools with high concentrations of students in poverty and that offered by high schools with more advantaged students. The authors also note the importance of noncurricular variables, such as peer influences, parental expectations, and conditions that encourage academic study. Interventions to improve college readiness offer a variety of services, from academic preparation and information about college and financial aid, to psychosocial and behavioral supports, to the development of habits of mind including organizational skills, anticipation, persistence, and resiliency. The authors also discuss more systemic programs, such as Middle College High Schools, and review efforts to allow high school students to take college classes (known as dual enrollment). Evaluations of the effectiveness of these efforts are limited, but the authors report that studies of precollege support programs generally show small impacts, while the more systemic programs show mixed results. Dual-enrollment programs show promise, but the evaluation designs may overstate the results. The Common Core State Standards, a voluntary set of goals and expectations in English and math adopted by most states, offer the potential to improve college and career readiness, the authors write. But that potential will be realized, they add, only if the standards are supplemented with the necessary professional development to enable educators to help all students meet academic college readiness standards, a focus on developing strong noncognitive knowledge and skills for all students, and the information and supports to help students prepare and select the most appropriate postsecondary institution.

AB  - Federal funding for INOP programs were intended to support the development of community policing programs, with the goal of reducing the demand for drugs through drug enforcement, interagency cooperation, referral to treatment, and community- based prevention initiatives. Each of the eight jurisdictions developed its own approach to the problem, and although the programs have a number of characteristics in common, the programs have varied widely in the context in which they operate; the nature and scope of their neighborhood focus; the approach to demand reduction; the nature of the interagency consortium; approach to community outreach; and the variety of other services provided. The eight INOP sites are Tempe, Ariz.; Norfolk, Va.; New York, N.Y.; Hayward, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Prince George's County, Md.; Houston, Tex.; and Louisville, Ky. The program descriptions presented in this volume are based on data collected by the Vera Institute of Justice between June 1991 and August 1992. The program descriptions address project background and target area, drug demand reduction activities, other program components, and expected impacts.

AB  - Introduction: Residents of Zambézia Province, Mozambique live from rural subsistence farming and fishing. The 2009 provincial HIV prevalence for adults 15–49 years was 12.6%, higher among women (15.3%) than men (8.9%). We reviewed clinical data to assess outcomes for HIV-infected children on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in a highly resource-limited setting. Methods: We studied rates of 2-year mortality and loss to follow-up (LTFU) for children <15 years of age initiating cART between June 2006–July 2011 in 10 rural districts. National guidelines define LTFU as >60 days following last-scheduled medication pickup. Kaplan-Meier estimates to compute mortality assumed non-informative censoring. Cumulative LTFU incidence calculations treated death as a competing risk. Results: Of 753 children, 29.0% (95% CI: 24.5, 33.2) were confirmed dead by 2 years and 39.0% (95% CI: 34.8, 42.9) were LTFU with unknown clinical outcomes. The cohort mortality rate was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.3, 10.4) after 90 days on cART and 19.2% (95% CI: 16.0, 22.3) after 365 days. Higher hemoglobin at cART initiation was associated with being alive and on cART at 2 years (alive: 9.3 g/dL vs. dead or LTFU: 8.3–8.4 g/dL, p<0.01). Cotrimoxazole use within 90 days of ART initiation was associated with improved 2-year outcomes Treatment was initiated late (WHO stage III/IV) among 48% of the children with WHO stage recorded in their records. Marked heterogeneity in outcomes by district was noted (p<0.001). Conclusions: We found poor clinical and programmatic outcomes among children taking cART in rural Mozambique. Expanded testing, early infant diagnosis, counseling/support services, case finding, and outreach are insufficiently implemented. Our quality improvement efforts seek to better link pregnancy and HIV services, expand coverage and timeliness of infant diagnosis and treatment, and increase follow-up and adherence.

AB  - Background: The rate of elective surgeries varies dramatically by geography in the United States. For many of these surgeries, there is not clear evidence of their relative merits over alternate treatment choices and there are significant tradeoffs in short- and long-term risks and benefits of selecting one treatment option over another. Conditions and symptoms for which there is this lack of a single clear evidence-based treatment choice present great opportunities for patient and provider collaboration on decision making; back pain and joint osteoarthritis are two such ailments. A number of decision aids are in active use to encourage this shared decision-making process. Decision aids have been assessed in formal studies that demonstrate increases in patient knowledge, increases in patient-provider engagement, and reduction in surgery rates. These studies have not widely demonstrated the added benefit of health coaching in support of shared decision making nor have they commonly provided strong evidence of cost reductions. In order to add to this evidence base, we undertook a comparative study testing the relative impact on health utilization and costs of active outreach through interactive voice response technology to encourage health coaching in support of shared decision making in comparison to mailed outreach or no outreach. This study focused on individuals with back pain or joint pain. Methods: We conducted four waves of stratified randomized comparisons for individuals with risk for back, hip, or knee surgery who did not have claims-based evidence of one or more of five chronic conditions and were eligible for population care management services within three large regional health plans in the United States. An interactive voice response (IVR) form of outreach that included the capability for individuals to directly connect with health coaches telephonically, known as AutoDialogW, was compared to a control (mailed outreach or natural levels of inbound calling depending on the study wave). In total, the study include 24,167 adults with commercial and Medicare Advantage private coverage at three health plans and at risk for lumbar back surgery, hip repair/ replacement, or knee repair/replacement. Results: Interactive voice response outreach led to 10.7 (P-value < .0001) times as many inbound calls within 30 days as the control. Over 180 days, the IVR group ("intervention") had 67 percent (P-value < .0001) more health coach communications and agreed to be sent 3.2 (P-value < .0001) time as many DVD- and/or booklet-based decision aids. Targeted surgeries were reduced by 6.7 percent (P-value = .6039). Overall costs were lower by 4.9 percent (P-value = .055). Costs that were not related to maternity, cancer, trauma and substance abuse ("actionable costs") were reduced by 6.5 percent (P-value = .0286). Conclusions: IVR with a transfer-to-health coach-option significantly increased levels of health coaching compared to mailed or no outreach and lead to significantly reduced actionable medical costs. Providing high levels of health coaching to individuals with these types of risks appears to have produced important levels of actionable medical cost reductions. We believe this impact resulted from more informed and engaged health care decision making.

AB  - Background: Confidentiality lies at the core of medical ethics and is the cornerstone for developing and keeping a trusting relationship between nurses and patients. In the wake of the HIV epidemic, there has been a heightened focus on confidentiality in healthcare contexts. Nurses’ follow-up of HIV-positive women and their susceptible HIV-exposed children has proved to be challenging in this regard, but the ethical dilemmas concerning confidentiality that emerge in the process of ensuring HIV-free survival of the third party – the child – have attracted limited attention. Objective: The study explores challenges of confidentiality linked to a third party in nurse–patient relationships in a rural Tanzanian HIV/AIDS context. Study context: The study was carried out in rural and semi-urban settings of Tanzania where the population is largely agro-pastoral, the formal educational level is low and poverty is rife. The HIV prevalence of 1.5% is low compared to the national prevalence of 5.1%. Methods: Data were collected during 9 months of ethnographic fieldwork and consisted of participant observation in clinical settings and during home visits combined with in-depth interviews. The main categories of informants were nurses employed in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV programmes and HIV-positive women enrolled in these programmes. Ethical considerations: Based on information about the study aims, all informants consented to participate. Ethical approval was granted by ethics review boards in Tanzania and Norway. Findings and discussion: The material indicates a delicate balance between the nurses’ attempt to secure the HIV-free survival of the babies and the mothers’ desire to preserve confidentiality. Profound confidentiality-related dilemmas emerged in actual practice, and indications of a lack of thorough consideration of the implication of a patient’s restricted disclosure came to light during follow-up of the HIV-positive women and the third party – the child who is at risk of HIV infection through mother’s milk. World Health Organization’s substantial focus on infant survival (Millennium Development Goal-4) and the strong calls for disclosure among the HIV-positive are reflected on in the discussion.

AB  - Theories on the etiology of child maltreatment generally focus on the interaction between multiple risk and protective factors. Moreover, the quadratic model of cumulative risk describes a threshold at which the risk of child maltreatment increases exponentially, suggesting a synergistic effect between risk factors. This study explored the interrelatedness of risk factors for child maltreatment. The sample consisted of risk assessments performed for both high-risk families (n = 2,399; child protection services) and lower risk families (n = 1,904; community outreach services). Network analyses were performed on parental risk factors. Three networks were constructed: a cross-sample network, a high-risk network, and a lower risk network. The relations between risk factors were examined, as well as the centrality of each risk factor in these networks. Additionally, the networks of the two samples were compared. The networks revealed that risk factors for child maltreatment were highly interrelated, which is consistent with Belsky's multi-dimensional perspective on child maltreatment. As expected, risk factors were generally stronger related to each other in the high-risk sample than in the lower risk sample. Centrality analyses showed that the following risk factors play an important role in the development of child maltreatment: "Caregiver was maltreated as a child", "History of domestic violence", and "Caregiver is emotionally absent". We conclude that studying the interrelatedness of risk factors contributes to knowledge on the etiology of child maltreatment and the improvement of both risk assessment procedures and interventions for child maltreatment.

AB  - Despite the growing HIV threat among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Malaysia, there is a dearth of information on their HIV risk behaviour. This study focused on identifying specific risk behaviours that distinguished HIV positive IDUs from those who were not. For the first time, data on IDUs not in treatment were obtained through a cross-sectional survey of 526 subjects recruited from five selected cities across peninsular Malaysia. A structured questionnaire and face-to-face interviews were utilised to collect detailed information on their drug use practices and sexual behaviours. On-site serological testing determined their HIV and hepatitis C status. The findings indicated that ethnic Malays, who are also Muslims, form the majority of IDUs not in treatment. Bivariate analysis identified six risk factors associated with HIV seropositivity: being 44 years or younger; not holding a regular job; initiating drug use at age 23 or younger; being a morphine user; sharing injecting equipment and having multiple-sex partners. However, only the last two remained significant in multivariate analysis. That sharing contaminated injecting equipment is a significant risk factor strongly justifies the widening of the pilot needle and syringe exchange programme initiated hesitantly in late 2005 as a reaction to the worsening HIV/AIDS situation. Condom use, though not independently significant, remains important because consistent and wider use could neutralise the second risk factor - having multiple-sex partners. The finding that injecting drug use is increasingly occurring in groups underscores the need for outreach programmes that emphasise safe injecting practices in group settings. In addition, counsellors should endeavour to convince drug users to enter treatment since being in treatment appears to reduce risk behaviours. Finally, conservative Muslim unease about harm reduction must be assuaged quickly since Malay Muslims form the majority of IDUs not in treatment.

AB  - The theme is designed to convey the power and essence of the common dream of the victims' rights movement over the last three decades, i.e., that crime victims have access to the legal rights and services to which they are entitled. This theme is reflected in all the components of this Resource Guide, which is intended to be used throughout the year in public education and community outreach efforts. Components of the Guide include public education and community awareness materials; information about electronic resources available from the National Criminal Justice Reference Service; a comprehensive Web site listing; resources for the news media to help promote Crime Victims Rights Week; statistical overviews that address 17 topics relevant to crime and victimization; a listing of toll-free information and referral numbers for victim assistance; and camera-ready artwork for posters, bookmarks, buttons, cover/title page for Victims' Rights Week material, and a letterhead. The 'Twenty Tips for Community Outreach' are designed to highlight the theme. Many of the concepts presented have been successfully sponsored in past years by State and local victim service organizations and coalitions. The introduction to the 'Twenty Tips' advises that the ultimate key to success is to involve as many individuals and organizations as possible in planning and implementing Crime Victims' Rights Week activities.

AB  - Objective: To gain an understanding of the experiences of women of Mexican descent, born in Mexico or the United States who live with intimate partner abuse. The study was part of a larger study of the process of disclosure by women of Mexican descent who are subjected to intimate partner abuse. Design: Descriptive qualitative approach. Setting: Two sites in a South Texas-Mexico border community: a woman’s shelter and an outreach agency. Participants: Twenty-six women of Mexican descent were interviewed. Methods: A semistructured interview guide was used to elicit participants’ views of their experiences with intimate partner abuse. Results: These narratives illuminate how the process of victimization and revictimization creates an environment that blinds people to abuse, promotes denial of abuse, and leads women to remain in a harmful situation. Conclusion: Nurses and other health care and service providers working with women must take the initiative to assess for abuse; a few simple questions might change the woman’s life and her children(s).

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop an exploratory approach to characterizing the pattern of recreational abuse of alcohol and other drugs abuse at Christmas work dinners. An adaptation of the rapid assessment methodology RARE was carried out through the combination of quantitative (rapid assessment surveys, n=444) and qualitative (observations and semistructured interviews, n=8) techniques. The fieldwork was carried out at 13 restaurants in Valencia and Alicante (Spain) in December 2007. In general we observed a marked increase in the use of alcohol and other substances compared to the rest of the year, though restaurant staff perceived a decrease in alcohol abuse attributable to new road traffic legislation. Cocaine is perceived as the illicit substance most widely used at such events. Younger coworkers initiate older ones in the use of illicit drugs, and the the latter may use this behaviour as a means of feeling younger and more uninhibited. Christmas work dinners propitiate a recreational substance-use pattern that requires adapted preventive and restrictive interventions, such as the introduction of suitable transport initiatives and the restriction of alcohol serving hours.

AB  - Prior to release from the Rhode Island state prison, women at the highest risk for reincarceration and HIV infection are assigned to the Women's HIV/Prison Prevention Program (WHPPP), a discharge program designed to reduce the likelihood of reincarceration and HIV infection. Candidates for the WHPPP must meet at least 1 of 3 criteria: iv drug or crack use, commercial sex work, or a history of prison recidivism with poor educational history and poor employment prospects. While incarcerated, the program S develops a relationship with a physician and a social worker and establishes an individualized discharge plan. After release, the same physician and social worker work with the client and assist an outreach worker in implementing the discharge plan. Data were collected from questionnaires administered to 78 women enrolled in the WHPPP from 1992–1995. The WHPPP recidivism rates were compared with a historical control group of all women incarcerated in 1992. The intervention group demonstrated lower recidivism rates than the control group at 3 mo and at 12 mo. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The AACC/SBC Excelerator project enabled community colleges and their partners in six states to expand special outreach and technology workforce training programs to people who are often ignored in the new economy: low-income adults, members of racial and ethnic minorities, welfare-to-work clients, at-risk youth, people with disabilities, and women. The effort has paid off: 75% of the participants successfully completed their training programs, earning technology and job search skills as well as college credits, certificates, and degrees. This report focuses on lessons drawn from the experiences of the community colleges that participated in this one-year project. It also offers recommendations to help guide other institutions in developing similar programs. A list of selected resources is included. (Contains 1 figure and 4 tables.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify the experience and development of academically underprepared emerging adult Latino community college students. The retention and completion of Latino college students in higher education is a serious concern for college officials and has led to the enactment of legislation by many state lawmakers across the United States. Not only has the context in which students persist evolved into a funded system based on outcomes, a new psychosocial level of development called emerging adulthood has been proposed with relatively unknown ramifications for Latino students. Using grounded theory methodology, this study has identified critical areas that can support Latino emerging adults as they persist at a California community college and who anticipate transferring to a baccalaureate degree institution. The three theoretical categories that materialized from this research, which supports Latino students in emerging adulthood in persisting at a community college, are: (a) evolving as a student, (b) self-awareness through reflection, and (c) giving back to help others. This interpretive framework suggests that Latino emerging adult students trace their identity through their concept of Community Cultural Wealth and critical consciousness to overcome oppression and succeed at a community college. This study offers three recommendations for further study and implementation. First, a socially responsive career theory can be developed from the framework suggested in this study and through critical consciousness. Second, a peer advising program should be developed at the site to provide Latino emerging adult students with the opportunity to give back and validate themselves and other students at the college. Finally, a strategic outreach initiative aimed at the parents of prospective Latino students who work in the housekeeping or caregiving industries could help and encourage their children and others in the community to pursue a degree and break the cycle of poverty present in many communities.

AB  - Unrealized maternal and child health goals continue to challenge Kenya where adverse outcomes remain high and diagnostic services are limited. The acute shortage of doctors and radiographers requires alternate human resources for health (HRH) with the ability to identify risk factors in pregnancy through Point-Of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS). A specialist radiologist and ultrasonography team partnered with midwives to adopt interprofessional task sharing and capacity building. Faculty from the Radiology Department of our hospital designed and implemented the project which was carried out at three outreach health service centres. Designing and implementing a training model to skill midwife sonographers with the capacity to accurately identify risk factors in pregnancy is an effective model to increase POCUS access. A collaborative task sharing model focused on training quality, validation of results, tracking of errors and specialist level clinical supervision yielded a safe and scalable model of HRH capacity building. Programme evaluation, verification of outcomes and dissemination of results were all monitored. The project was a successful HRH task sharing and interprofessional learning initiative involving task sharing a clearly defined suite of sonographer competencies with participating midwives. The programme increased POCUS accessibility at the three outreach clinics with proven outcomes in the early detection and referral of risk factors in pregnancy.

AB  - Public information and outreach have emerged as one of the fundamental activities of transitional justice mechanisms. Their objective is to raise public awareness, knowledge and participation among affected communities. Despite this increased focus, understanding of the role, impact and effectiveness of various outreach strategies remains limited, as is understanding of communities' knowledge, perceptions and attitudes about transitional justice mechanisms, including their expectations. The study discussed in this article was designed to evaluate International Criminal Court (ICC) outreach programs in the Central African Republic. Specifically, the article examines how the public gathers information about the ICC and what factors influence knowledge levels and perceptions in relation to the Court. The findings show that mass media and informational meetings are effective at raising awareness and knowledge, but that the lack of access to formal media and reliance on informal channels of communication create a group of `information poor' individuals. The authors suggest that outreach must be local in order to respond to individuals' needs and expectations and to ensure their access to information. Evaluation research must be implemented systematically and on a continuing basis to assess how best to reach various target groups and develop innovative, responsive and flexible communication strategies.

AB  - Training needs, attitudes, and career patterns of 1979-1980 recipients of Section 426 child welfare training grants were investigated in a national followup study. Of 872 mail questionnaires, 413 usable responses were received. The respondents are predominantly white females in their 20's, the majority unmarried and childless. The great majority (81 percent) are employed. Of employed trainees, 59 percent work in a child welfare or related agency, 25 percent are doing social work not in child welfare, and 16 percent are employed outside of social work. Nearly half the trainees are employed in child welfare work in public agencies. Those graduates who have entered social work generally are satisfied with their work, particularly its professional aspects. Training areas viewed as most helpful in practice include services to adolescents; racial, ethnic, and cultural differences; protective services; legal knowledge; and field placement. Areas in which respondents perceived a need for inservice training included working with troubled adolescents, identifying and lessening worker stress, preventive outreach to at-risk families, and treating troubled families. Overall, the career patterns of these graduates demonstrate a definite commitment to child welfare and social work in general. Tables and the followup questionnaire are included.

AB  - Ceasefire is a violence prevention initiative in Chicago that employs the use of street interventionists who provide outreach to those most at risk for shooting someone or getting shot themselves. Violence Interrupters are ex-gang leaders who now forge peace agreements between gangs, or quell brewing problems. Outreach workers see clients in a case management capacity to offer them positive alternatives to street life and violence. The ten violence interrupters on staff were members of street organizations, in various leadership positions a have served prison time. Twenty-four (60%) of the 40 outreach staff surveyed reported that they were former gang members. 67.5% of outreach workers surveyed served time in prison, 60% of these serving time for violent offenses. None have served time for or been convicted of sexual crimes. Initial data shows that outreach workers and violence interrupters, who have felony convictions have larger case loads: of the workers who served time, 63.0% had more than 20 clients compared to 46.2% of the non-felons. Having had felony convictions allows these workers to access sensitive information more expeditiously, as they are better able to 1.) identify reliable contacts, 2.) develop a rapport, 3.) effectively influence high risk individuals from using violence.

AB  - Statistics on juvenile arrests and crime; offenses of children in secure custody; and the use of secure detention, jails, and less secure detention reveal that only 16.2 percent of the juveniles detained in Virginia's jails in 1982 were held for alleged or adjudicated offenses against persons. Moreover, in 1980, Virginia ranked sixth in the Nation in the number of juveniles jailed. The Virginia Department of Corrections has no centralized systematic reporting or records of suicides and assaults in jails, although studies have found a high suicide rate for jailed juveniles and considerable sexual, physical, and psychological victimization. The legal rights of juveniles in jail are examined, using cases heard by the Federal courts and the Supreme Court. Also discussed are criteria for decisionmaking in the juvenile justice system proposed by national organizations; alternative program models to secure custody for juveniles; and specific programs available in Virginia, such as crisis intervention centers, less secure facilities, outreach detention, and emergency foster care. The report includes recommendations for eliminating the inappropriate use of adult jails for juveniles; references; tables; an assessment of the National Advisory Committee for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention's detention criteria; and the questionnaire sent to juvenile court judges, intake officers, and sheriffs in Virginia.

AB  - The article presents a study that compares the visual ideology of the street homeless, as represented in editorial cartoons, with observations of street homeless in a San Francisco public park. The purpose of this study was to identify societal perceptions of the homeless, as presented by cartoonists, in order to determine the extent to which certain aspects of homelessness are represented or mis-represented by the cartoon media, compared to field observations, identify concepts of identity and choice of street homeless, which emerged based on ethnographic research, and generate hypotheses and research questions for further study of depictions of the homeless by the mass media. Because of the communication constraints of cartoons, these visual depictions of the homeless are generally limited to commonly held stereotypes. This highly heterogeneous population is over represented as consisting of middle-aged male alcoholics, and only some of their problems are depicted. As to reasons for their plight, cartoonists focus on social policies and rarely depict individuals as making choices to end homelessness, such as seeking alcohol/drug treatment, employment, etc.

AB  - Escape games are useful in the informal teaching of physics or outreach programs, and in the last few years we studied its efficiency as a tool in physics teaching [1]. We designed an inquiry-based learning project on fluid mechanics, a topic missing both from the Hungarian and Romanian physics curricula. The goal of our study was to compare previous knowledge on fluid mechanics of student's coming from different educational background. Activities were conducted with three similar groups of students in two high schools from each country. More specifically, we worked out a classroom escape game on fluid dynamics, where participants had to use several informational sources. We combined history of science topics, the use of the internet (both for getting information from and gaining motivation), and "in-situ" experiments. The tasks covered basic concepts, application of hydrodynamic pressure, and the study of von Kármán vortex street. We have tested this learning project with students of different interest, different educational background and of different age (year 9 and 11). We made a research on differences in the intrinsic physics knowledge of students from the two countries using the tools of methodological research: semi-structured interviews and surveys (also postponed tests by a quiz to see the long-term results). We found some similarities and some differences in student's knowledge from the two countries. Our inquiry-based learning project helped students to gain phenomenological scientific literacy in a cooperative way.

AB  - The phenomenon of 'street children' where young people, for various reasons, live on the streets of towns and cities is found all over the world in varying degrees and forms. In South Africa, one approach to take care about the plight of these children has been to set up and run what are referred to as 'street shelters'. One such street shelter, the only one exclusively for girls in the city of Durban, is Tennyson House. In this paper I describe an innovative outreach programme integrated with a university curriculum in which a group of pre-service teachers taking mathematics education as a major were involved in teaching mathematics to girls at Tennyson House. From the vantage point of a mathematics teacher educator in the programme, I describe and reflect on what was experienced and learned from the intervention in terms of three aspects: learning about learners; learning about teaching (mathematics) and learning about relationships.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes the process of design, development, and implementation of a complex, multi-component, tertiary prevention intervention aimed at stabilizing pathways out of homelessness, the Housing Outreach Project-Collaborative (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multi-organizational, cross-sector, inter-professional collaboration. This process-oriented paper aims to elucidate the rationale for and experience of implementing the three main components of HOP-C: case management, mental health treatment and peer support, as well as the processes that support this wrap-around intervention as a whole. This paper draws on qualitative process-oriented data (i.e. field notes and interviews with staff) collected over the course of the intervention, and integrates perspectives from multiple practitioners involved in this endeavour. Practitioners reported the diversity in the type and intensity of services offered to clients, the building of a close and communicative interprofessional and inter-agency team, as well as the development of broader connectivity between organizations and practitioners as significant strengths of this approach. Challenges and successes in implementation are explored with the intention of providing insight into ways in which other collaborative complex interventions might be approached in the youth homelessness sector. Highlights • Youth homelessness is a complex social problem • HOP-C is a tertiary prevention complex intervention for youth transitioning from homelessness • HOP-C represents a cross-sector, cross-agency, interprofessional collaboration • Intervention provided wrap-around case management, peer, and mental health supports • Individualized supports and close interprofessional teams linked to positive youth outcomes [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Children & Youth Services Review is the property of Pergamon Press - An Imprint of Elsevier Science and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Young people appropriate and redefine built environments through their everyday playful practices. Among a widening spectrum of young city dwellers, skateboarders transform urban spaces by exploring terrains and performing unforeseen uses. These urban explorations ascribe new meanings and pleasures to otherwise mundane built forms. Waxing ledges is a ubiquitous practice among skateboarders that signals creative appropriation through the application of wax on rough surfaces. The smoothening of ledges enables speed and exhilaration, while the traces engraved on the urban landscape communicate to other skateboarders a pleasurable space. This article chronicles the emergence of an alternative ethic of care for built environments through the urban practice of skateboarding. It focuses on the Chicago skateboarding scene and draws from data gathered through ethnographic fieldwork during 2009–2010. Skateboarders' ethic of care for built environments is further developed in this article through the coupling of skateboarding with a host of sustainability-themed projects such as recycled installation art at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and grassroots activism from the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization. These examples highlight the intersections of skateboarding and the sustainability agenda in the city of Chicago. Furthermore, this article pushes the limits of this agenda by exposing linkages with processes of youth cooptation and criminalisation as the Chicago skateboarding scene takes shape throughout both sanctioned skate parks and illicit skate spots. Skateboarders forward an alternative sustainability through bottom-up playful tactics that promote an ethic of care for built environments. This article argues for young people as agents of change through the everyday practice of skateboarding.

AB  - Background Diversion of methadone outside treatment programs occurs, yet reasons for use of ‘street methadone’ are characterized poorly. Self-medication for withdrawal symptoms is one plausible hypothesis. Among HIV-infected drug users, some antiretroviral medications can reduce potency of methadone, yet any association between such effects and the use of supplemental methadone sources remains undetermined. Objective To estimate the frequency and risk factors for use of street methadone. Methods Injection drug users (IDUs) recruited through extensive community outreach in 1988–89 and 1994 were followed semi-annually with questionnaires about health history, use of licit and illicit drugs including methadone and HIV-related assays. Analyses were performed using generalized estimating equation logistic regression. Results Of 2811 IDUs enrolled and eligible for analysis, 493 people reported use of street methadone over 12 316 person-years of follow-up (4.0/100 person-years). In multivariate analyses, street methadone use was more common among women, whites, those 40–59 years old, those who reported withdrawal symptoms, past methadone program attendance (6–12 months before visit), recent heroin injection with or without cocaine (but not cocaine alone), smoking or sniffing heroin and reported trading sex. Street methadone was not associated with HIV infection or treatment. Conclusion The results suggest that older IDUs still using heroin may be using street methadone to treat signs of withdrawal. The absence of a higher rate of street methadone use in HIV seropositive IDUs reveals that antiretroviral/methadone interactions are not a primary determinant of use outside of treatment settings.

AB  - Background. Online social networking services such as Facebook provide a novel medium for the dissemination of public health information by poison control centers in the United States. We performed a cross-sectional study of poison control center Facebook pages to describe and assess the use of this medium. Methods. Facebook pages associated with poison control centers were identified during a continuous two-week period from December 24, 2012 to January 7, 2013. Data were extracted from each page, including affiliated poison control center; page duration, measured in years since registration; number of subscribers; number of postings by general toxicological category; and measures of user-generated activity including “likes”, “shares”, and comments per posting. Results. Among the 56 US poison control centers, 39 Facebook pages were identified, of which 29 were currently active. The total number of active pages has increased by 140% from 2009 to 2013 (average of 25% per year). The total number of all subscribers to active pages was 11,211, ranging from 40 to 2,456 (mean 387, SD 523), equal to 0.006% of all Facebook users in the United States. The number of subscribers per page was associated with page duration, number of postings, and type of postings. The types of toxicological postings were public education (45%), self-promotion (28%), childhood safety (12%), drugs of abuse (8%), environmental poisonings (6%), and general overdoses (1%). Conclusion. Slightly over half of all poison control centers in the United States are supplementing their outreach and education efforts through Facebook. In general, the more active the poison control center on Facebook, the more page followers and follower engagement gained.

AB  - Discusses attitudinal data derived from a discussion group of 5 clients in a substance-abuse treatment program who tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Ss' reactions to test results included depression, anxiety, feelings of being experimented on, and a sense of unfinished business with family and friends. There was an increased concern for personal health and for that of significant others. Ss were well aware of possible prejudice, hostility, and rejection. Ss showed increased commitment to treatment and also supported the distribution of clean needles to addicts and community outreach programs that teach abusers to sterilize their equipment to prevent the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

AB  - Abstract: Aim: To explore socio-demographic factors, health risks and harms associated with early initiation of injecting (before age 16) among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Tallinn, Estonia. Methods: IDUs were recruited using respondent driven sampling methods for two cross-sectional interviewer-administered surveys (in 2007 and 2009). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with early initiation versus later initiation. Results: A total of 672 current IDUs reported the age when they started to inject drugs; the mean was 18 years, and about a quarter of the sample (n =156) reported early initiation into injecting drugs. Factors significantly associated in multivariate analysis with early initiation were being female, having a lower educational level, being unemployed, shorter time between first drug use and injecting, high-risk injecting (sharing syringes and paraphernalia, injecting more than once a day), involvement in syringe exchange attendance and getting syringes from outreach workers, and two-fold higher risk of HIV seropositivity. Conclusions: Our results document significant adverse health consequences (including higher risk behaviour and HIV seropositivity) associated with early initiation into drug injecting and emphasize the need for comprehensive prevention programs and early intervention efforts targeting youth at risk. Our findings suggest that interventions designed to delay the age of starting drug use, including injecting drug use, can contribute to reducing risk behaviour and HIV prevalence among IDUs.

AB  - Those experiencing homelessness (IEHs) are more likely to have more health issues, more unmet health needs, higher occurrences of excess morbidity and mortality, have less control over manageable chronic health conditions, and are three to four times more likely to die prematurely than their housed counterparts. The causes of these health disparities are deeply rooted in the social context surrounding everyday life, where the interplay of various identity factors determines one's vulnerability. Vulnerability thus represents the multiplicity and convergence of risk factors inherently tied to individuals marginalized identities and lived experiences. Therefore, in order to comprehensively understand the pathways leading to health disparities, a deeper understanding of the social context of vulnerability as a determinant of health is needed. The injustices experienced by IEHs happen in their everyday lives where interactions with the domiciled populations further influence the occurrence and impact of marginalization. Research well supports how these occur from the homeless populations perspectives, but insight from service providers (SPs) is lacking in regards to understanding how vulnerability among IEHs manifests in the lived context, specifically the service provision setting. The goal of this study was to understand how vulnerability manifests in the lived context by allowing study participants the opportunity to tell their story. Through interviews and digital storytelling, this study proposes to understand service providers' perception of vulnerability as experienced by IEHs. Guided by an intersectionality framework, knowledge production was informed by eliciting SPs descriptions and viewpoints regarding IEHs experience with their primary identity of 'being homeless' while allowing for other influential categories to be determined that lead to more occurrences of marginalization. The data collected included 8 ethnographic fieldwork participant observations, 7 semi- structured SP interviews and 5 digital stories and reflection interviews. This data was analyzed using standard content analysis and constant comparison to construct themes pertaining interactions between SPs and IEHs, and how vulnerability manifests in the service provision context. Three themes emerged from the data, focused on the 'navigating' IEHs and SPs have to do in the service and lived context. These include navigating the meaning of time, navigating the system and navigating change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Suicide is the second leading cause of death among college students. One effective strategy for suicide prevention is gatekeeper training. Gatekeeper training has been described as a prevention strategy that improves detection and referral of at-risk individuals. Purdue recognized that only some of the resident assistants (RAs) were receiving this important training, leaving a significant hole in the campus safety net. The capacity of the outreach arm of the campus counseling center needed to be expanded. In partnership with the campus counseling center, they opted to use a "train the trainer" (TTT) model that allowed faculty and clinical experts to train counseling graduate students to provide standardized suicide prevention and outreach on campus. In addition to providing a needed service to the campus in training RAs, counseling students could benefit from learning specific content about crisis and suicide prevention. The ALIVE @ Purdue team trained a total of 12 graduate students to serve as ALIVE @ Purdue Educators. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this innovative method of training counseling students in suicide prevention and outreach programming.

AB  - This report brings together existing evidence from the literature and media reports, as well as evidence collected from case studies in two London boroughs. Interviews were conducted with staff in government agencies, including the police, housing departments, schools, the Youth Service, and the Probation Service; interviews were also conducted with local people, including victims and perpetrators. The study found that the perpetrators of racial harassment and violence are of all ages and of both sexes, who often act together as friends or as families. Some perpetrators may also be involved in other antisocial acts, violence toward other groups or individuals, or crime in general. The views held by all kinds of perpetrators toward ethnic minorities are shared by the wider communities to which they belong. For the communities in which the perpetrators live, racism and its expression often divert attention from underlying problems in their lives with which they feel powerless to cope. Two main sets of factors apparently contribute to racial harassment and violence: factors that stimulate stress, delinquency, or criminality; and factors that spawn racial prejudice. Policies that address these factors are likely to impact racial harassment and violence. The prevention of racial harassment over the long term should involve the identification of and effective action against perpetrators; the identification of potential perpetrators and the development of strategies to divert them from becoming perpetrators; and the development of a range of strategies for addressing the perpetrator community's general attitudes toward ethnic minorities. Appended description of fieldwork conducted in the case-study areas and 42 references

AB  - In this conference review, the author reviews the first The New Ethnographer (TNE) pre‐fieldwork training workshop for doctoral students that took place over two days at the London School of Economics and Political Science in February 2020. TNE's approach to pre‐fieldwork training runs counter to institutionalized approaches of risk management: it acknowledges fieldwork's inherent messiness and ethnographers' emotional and embodied entanglements, while inviting participants to rethink the language of 'risk' and 'danger'. TNE's contribution lies in facilitating frank and experimental conversations between early career researchers, first via its digital platform, and now through scenario‐based learning in the classroom.

There are effective early interventions to promote mental health in vulnerable groups, but it is necessary to both initiate and facilitate a cross-sectoral approach, and to form partnerships between different government departments, civic society organisations and other stakeholders. This approach is referred to as Mental Health in All Policies and it can be applied to all public policy levels from local policies to supranational.

AB  - This article presents an introductory yet critical overview of autoethnographic research in criminological contexts. Drawing on experiences of participant observation with heroin and crack cocaine users and dealers, as a former user and dealer of these drugs myself, the article demonstrates how the domains of fieldwork, biography and the emotions intersect to render clear a progressive account of heroin addiction. However, this is offset against some negative occurrences directly reducible to doing ethnography where biographical congruence exists between the researcher and the researched. Ultimately, it is argued here that an increased consideration of the self—biographically and emotionally—both permits and facilitates the presentation of analytic yet stylized data in the form of what is termed below, ‘lyrical criminology’.

AB  - It seems that no self-respecting orchestra can do without one. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra said on Monday that it had appointed Yo-Yo Ma, above right, to the new position of creative consultant. Mr. Ma will work with the conductor Riccardo Muti, above left, who takes over as music director next season. In a similar vein, the New York Philharmonic added the singer Thomas Hampson as artist in residence, joining its new music director, Alan Gilbert, this season, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic appointed the composer John Adams as its creative chair, in tandem with Gustavo Dudamel, its new music director. In the case of Mr. Ma, the emphasis will be more on using the orchestra to serve as an engine for social good. He will have a role, undefined so far, in a concert series for 3-to-5-year-olds; workshops for high school and college students; and programming for incarcerated and at-risk youth. He will also give advice for the orchestra's outreach programs for young people. ''We love doing concerts,'' Mr. Ma said, ''but there is something more important than doing concerts.''

AB  - The role of (entrepreneurial) universities as change agents in regional economic development has been highlighted previously, but how they can drive regional sustainable development in developing countries has been largely neglected to date. Using qualitative methods and building upon institutional perspectives of sustainable change, we show how being confronted with adverse poverty and pollution in local contexts can drive an entrepreneurial university to develop a sustainability vision that accordingly becomes the driver of institutional change. We demonstrate how local campus leadership, a holistic teaching and research programme, and student involvement can have significant local effects over the short term. However, we also show how liabilities of smallness hinder the creation of significant sustainable local impact. Instead, the campus becomes an incubation space for novel institutional practices for regional development. Indeed, the most promising initiatives return to the original campus for scaling up. This study helps to characterize the entrepreneurial university by first presenting universities as drivers for sustainable change through education and outreach, rather than via traditional commercialization activities and notably in developing countries. Second, the study illustrates the risks and value of creating a separate space for novel concepts for sustainable development to be tested prior to returning these concepts to the principal location.

AB  - The program offers at-risk or troubled students long- term counseling and advocacy during the academic year. School outreach counselors depend on principals, assistant principals, deans, and teachers to identify students at risk of developing problems related to alcohol or drugs, or who are experiencing conflicts with peers, teachers, or family members. The School Outreach Program offers students and their families individual counseling, information and referral, client advocacy, group counseling, crisis intervention, and family counseling. Because of the program, many students overcome their problems before they become critical. It has a positive impact on schools by reducing the incidence of substance abuse, truancy, poor classroom performance, and dropping out of school. After providing an overview of the program, this manual explains how to get started by contracting with schools. This is followed by chapters with details on program structure, networking, program evaluation, staffing and staff development, and funding. 77-item bibliography and appended supplementary information

AB  - The solution to the problem of violence in the schools lies not only in the protection of students, but the prevention of aggressive, antisocial behavior. This monograph is designed to help schools build a violence-prevention program from the ground up. Following the introduction, chapter 1 discusses how the causes and consequences of violence in the schools are inseparable from the roots of violence in American society. Chapter 2 examines the processes of assessing and establishing policies, programs, and facilities that research indicates are useful in preventing violence. Chapter 3 describes responsibilities at the district, school, and classroom levels. The fourth chapter provides an overview of violence-prevention programs under way in Oregon, including counseling programs, intensive primary prevention, a violence-prevention curriculum, conflict resolution and peer mediation, domestic-violence prevention, multicultural issues, anger management, substance abuse, and gangs. Outreach programs to involve students and the community are described in the final chapter. Information is based on a review of research and a total of 21 interviews conducted with juvenile counselors, school administrators, educators, a police officer, and program coordinators in Oregon. One table and a four-page condensation of the document ("Bulletin in Brief") are included. (LMI)

AB  - The objectives of this study were to explore the relationships of baseline dietary intakes and frequency of attendance at point-of-testing nutrition counseling sessions to selected risk factors for chronic diseases during a 3-year intervention. This study was part of a large multidisciplinary, community-based health outreach project conducted in a rural community of northern Louisiana. Screenings, point-of-testing counseling, weekly group exercise sessions, and group nutrition education sessions were provided over a period of 3 years. Outcome variables assessed at 6-month intervals over 3 years were body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and total and LDL cholesterol and dietary intake. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to investigate the impact of the frequency of counseling sessions on outcome variables. Paired t-tests were used to identify points at which significant changes occurred. A total of 159 subjects ages 65 years and older participated in this study. The majority of the participants were female (62%) and White (82%). Attending the point of testing counseling for more than two sessions was important for a significant improvement in BMI (p ≤ 0.001), LDL cholesterol (p ≤ 0.03), blood glucose (p ≤ 0.03), and diastolic blood pressure (p ≤ 0.045). Participants who attended at least three sessions had significant reductions in risk factors for obesity and related chronic diseases, underscoring the importance of follow-up sessions after health screening.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to examine caregiver management strategies for child sexual abuse (CSA) when presented with hypothetical scenarios that vary in physical invasiveness. Methods: One hundred fifty three caregivers were given 3 scenarios of CSA with 7 management strategies presented in the 21-item Taking Action Strategies (TAS) scale. Caregivers were asked to rate strategies according to their willingness to carry out each action with rating of 5=greater likelihood of carrying out the action specified while a rating of 1=a lower likelihood of carrying out that action. CSA scenarios included exposure to pornography/masturbation, fondling, and penetration while management strategies including fighting the accused, blaming the child, and outreaching to the authorities. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare mean TAS scores for the management strategies across CSA scenarios. Results: The difference between TAS scores across the abuse scenarios was statistically significant (p <.001). Mean TAS scores reflected greater preference for taking action if the abusive act was perceived as more physically intrusive (exposure to pornography/masturbation-TAS 3.5, fondling-TAS 3.7, penetration-TAS 3.8). Caregivers reported being less willing to handle a disclosure of CSA without outreach (TAS 2.5 and 2.0 for fighting and blaming the child, respectively) and more willing to manage a disclosure with outreach to authorities (TAS 3.8, 4.5, and 4.7 for outreaching to Child Protective Services [CPS], to the child's healthcare provider and police, respectively). A predictor of caregiver outreach to authorities identified was the caregiver having past interactions with CPS. Conclusion: Perception of the physical invasiveness of CSA and demographic factors can impact caregiver management strategies after a disclosure. Practice implications: Results suggest that several factors influence caregiver management of sexual abuse. These factors warrant further study, as they are potential contributors to declining trends in CSA cases observed. Other implications include the need for educational efforts targeting caregivers. These interventions should focus on dispelling myths about the perceived physical invasiveness of CSA. These perceptions should not mitigate a caregiver's decision to involve the authorities in their management after a disclosure. Lastly, despite criticisms of the child protective systems, caregivers with past encounters with CPS view these related agencies as valuable resources.

AB  - Police, usually the first professionals on the crime scene, can provide practical assistance to victims, including helping them complete insurance forms and begin steps to repair property damage. They can advise victims how to prevent future victimization and also protect them from reprisal by the offender if they cooperate with the police and prosecutor. Police should remain in contact with crime victims to inform them about the progress of their cases and help them contact appropriate service agencies and compensation programs. Police should be trained to help crime victims cope with the emotional trauma victims experience in the hours and days immediately after the crime. One of the most impressive models of police services for crime victims is that of the Edmonton Police Department (Canada). Its program involves each patrol officer and uses a central victim assistance unit to serve victims identified on the police computerized information system. The police contacts vary from correspondence and telephone calls to 'outreach' visits by volunteers. One indicator of the program's effectiveness is that it doubled the number of claims to the Alberta Victims Compensation Board in the first year of operation. 24 references

AB  - Within the United States, African Americans account for 13% of the entire population, making them the second largest minority group. A notable concern is the rate at which African Americans fail to utilize both medical and mental health services. Researchers have long examined possible factors, such as stigmas, barriers, and accessibility, as reasons why African Americans underutilize psychological help. Overlooked is the potential influence of adverse childhood experiences (ACE). The term ACE encompasses ten major domains, ranging from emotional abuse to parental divorce/separation, all of which have been found to negatively influence individuals’ well-being. As such, this study examined the association between African American women’s adverse childhood experiences and help seeking attitudes. Data for this study were gathered from 64 African American female college students. Adverse childhood experiences were measured with the Traumatic Experiences Checklist (TEC) and help seeking attitudes were assessed with the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help-Short Form (ATSPPH-SF). Results demonstrated scores reflecting childhood traumatic events for violence, death, and legal involvement were negatively related to attitudes toward help seeking. The results of this study highlight the need for continued research regarding ACE for African American women in college settings. Specific implications for this study include outreach development in university counseling centers focused on the association between childhood trauma, violence/legal involvement, and intersectionality. Programming of this nature may provide a critical link to increase this population’s utilization of mental health services. Keywords: African American women, ACE, help seeking

AB  - Fear of controversy, cultural taboos, and fear of homosexuality have prevented many educators from dealing effectively with gay and lesbian young people. The climate in most schools is such that gay teens rarely are willing to expose themselves to the ridicule, harassment, and abuse that comes when they openly acknowledge their sexual orientation. Instead, they hide their sexuality in order to pass for "normal." Such concealment takes a terrible psychological and emotional toll. The result can be behavioral choices that place adolescents at risk of school failure, disease, and even death. To counteract these conditions, educators will need to acknowledge that homosexuality is a variation in sexual orientation and that they have a professional responsibility to provide information, counseling, and other services. They will need to take deliberate steps to eliminate the negative attitudes and actions of students and staff in their schools that place gay teens at risk. (KM)

AB  - Community building is an approach to urban poverty that rejects a programmatic approach in favor of efforts that catalyze personal relationships and social networks to improve community life. Community building analyzes urban poverty as a web of interwoven problems that can lock families out of opportunity permanently. Community building initiatives try to address the economic, social, and political marginalization of urban communities. The best community initiatives make progress on most fronts, but none has had equal success on all fronts. In examining initiatives with something to share, this report focuses on initiatives that have the most to teach in specific areas. Engaging government systems is illustrated by a case study of the Chatham-Savannah Youth Futures Authority (Georgia). The Comprehensive Community Revitalization Project in the South Bronx (New York) illustrates the importance of building local institutions that can provide needed services. Investing in outreach and organizing is illustrated by Community Building in Partnership, Baltimore (Maryland). Involving the corporate sector in social, political, and economic agenda is illustrated by the Atlanta Project (Georgia). Oakland's Urban Strategies Council (California) shows the importance of developing new structures to facilitate activities on many fronts. Part One closes with four personal accounts that show community-building strategies in use. Part Two examines issues from the field in the five areas explored through case studies, and the conclusion discusses the unfinished business of community building. (SLD)

AB  - Living at high altitude carries risks, so settlement there can be thought marginal. Its success or failure ought to be dependent on the environment and the climate. But recent fieldwork in the French Alps shows that exploitation was not coincident with climatic conditions: Mesolithic people found the hunting good; in the climatic optimum of the Roman period the high altitudes were said to be uninhabitable and apparently were; while in the Little Ice Age of the fourteenth century and Liter, the high Alps were at their busiest. The author hypothesises that social control arid perception, rather than climate, were the determinant factors.

AB  - Teaching is a difficult profession in ideal circumstances. The job requires immense talent and training when students have the overwhelming challenges associated with poverty. Teachers will succeed only if they are given excellent preparation and valuable fieldwork experience with effective teachers. School boards and leaders can and must insist that teacher prep programs step up to this challenge. If their teachers do not receive the training and support they need, students will continue to be denied the education that will ensure they meet and exceed high expectations. This article discusses ideas on how to attract the best teachers.

AB  - Since the latter part of the twentieth century there has been increasing recognition of the need for more effective approaches to engaging adolescent boys. Much of the focus in youth work practice and research has previously been dominated by attempts to better understand young male bio-social and cognitive development through examining high risk issues such as offending, violence, substance use, anti-social behaviour and mental health. The recent interest in critical studies of masculinities have further highlighted complex and contradictory ways in which traditional notions of becoming a man impact, often negatively, upon male behaviour and development. Despite increased awareness and concern about adolescent male development, practitioners across various professions frequently report finding it difficult to engage positively with certain young men and admit to lacking the confidence and skills to develop meaningful practice. This paper draws upon thirty years’ experience of youth work practice and social research carried out by the authors with adolescent boys within a divided and contested political context. However, while the article draws upon local research findings and practice experiences from Northern Ireland, we believe the learning will be of value to educators and practitioners working with adolescent boys in other societies and contexts.

AB  - Purpose of Review The MaxART Consortium-led by the Eswatini Ministry of Health-implemented multiple interventions between 2012 and 2017 to achieve UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. We summarize key findings from community outreach strategies in support of the first 90 goal, and from the Early Access to ART for All (EAAA) trial on the implementation of a ``Treat All{''} strategy to achieve the second and third 90 goals within a government-managed public health system. Recent Findings The MaxART Consortium demonstrated that ``Fast Track,{''} a problem-solving approach, was effective at increasing testing coverage in the community. Compared with baseline data at 3 months prior to the start of the Fast Track, there was a 273% proportional increase in HIV tests conducted among adolescent males, adolescent females, and adult men, and 722% over baseline for adolescent males. The MaxART EAAA trial further showed that implementation of the Treat All policy was associated with significant two-fold shorter time from enrollment into care to ART initiation than under the standard CD4+ cell threshold-based treatment guidelines. Finally, through the MaxART trial, Eswatini was able to identify areas for further investment, including addressing the system-side barriers to routine viral load monitoring, and designing and implementing innovative community-based approaches to reach individuals who were not more routinely accessing HIV testing and counseling services. As low- and middle-income countries adopt the Treat All approach in their national HIV care and treatment guidelines, further implementation science research is needed to understand and address the system-level barriers to achieving the benefits of Treat All for HIV-infected individuals and those at risk.

AB  - It is well known that recruitment into general practice (GP) is low, particularly in deprived areas. Undergraduate medical students are encouraged to learn about health inequalities. However, teaching on this area has been perceived by some as uninspiring. Innovative teaching opportunities can engage students but more research is needed regarding exposure to deprived inner-city settings. Street Medics is an extra-curricular, educational initiative which enables students to join GPs doing street-outreach work. The aim of the study was to understand what motivates undergraduate medical students to engage with Street Medics and the impact of the experience. Focus group data were collected and thematically analysed. Motivating factor themes: appetite to explore; previous exposure including observation of perceived sub-optimal care to marginalised patients; perceived lack of exposure personally and in undergraduate teaching. Experience and impact themes: increased understanding of social determinants of health; change in perception; influence on career intentions; desire to incorporate into curriculum. Opportunities like Street Medics can supplement the undergraduate curriculum and not only challenge students' perceptions of marginalised patients but also ignite their enthusiasm for pursuing GP. By understanding the factors driving students' engagement in innovative educational opportunities, effective methods can be shared across undergraduate courses.

AB  - Preventing risky sexual behavior among adolescents is a vital public health issue. This chapter describes why this issue is so important, due to high rates of adolescent pregnancy, STIs, and HIV in the USA, as well as the economic costs to society that these issues present. Using behavioral theory to develop programs that prevent risky sexual behavior is critical in creating effective programs that contribute to the reduction of risk behaviors. Examples of these types of programs and their venues are presented and described in detail. Lastly, additional resources are provided to aid in planning and developing programs to reduce risky sexual health behavior among adolescents.

AB  - Last weekend, the Oakland rapper Philthy Rich, who is on probation for firearms possession, was arrested on charges of driving an allegedly stolen Bentley. He posted $30,000 bail. Then he made plans to speak at an elementary school in support of nonviolence. In a past era, youth mentors were expected to have squeaky-clean records. But Philthy Rich, whose birth name is Philip Beasley, is among a new generation of role models who are being welcomed into community outreach organizations. Their credibility with young people, these groups say, is bolstered by their experience growing up in Oakland's high-crime neighborhoods, including run-ins with the law.

AB  - Objective To determine risk factors and estimate their population-level contribution to hepatitis C virus (HCV) burden. Methods Established and potentially modifiable risk factors were estimated using partial population attributable risk ( PARp) in a cohort of new injecting drug users (IDUs) in Sydney, Australia. Results A total of 204 hepatitis C seronegative IDUs were recruited through street-based outreach, methadone clinics and needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) and followed-up at 3–6-monthly intervals. A total of 61 HCV seroconversions were observed during the follow-up [overall incidence rate of 45.8 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval: 35.6–58.8)]. Overall, five potentially modifiable risk factors (sharing needles/syringes, sharing other injecting equipment, assisted injecting, frequency of injection and not being in drug treatment) accounted for approximately 50% of HCV cases observed. Conclusion While sharing needles/syringes or other injecting equipment were associated most strongly with increased risk of HCV infection, the PARp associated with these behaviours was relatively modest (12%) because they are relatively low-prevalence behaviours. Our analyses suggest that more HCV infection could be avoided by changing more common, but less strongly associated behaviours such as assisted injecting or daily injecting. Results suggest that to have a very substantial effect on HCV, a range of risk factors need modifying. The most efficient use of scarce resources in reducing HCV infections will require complex balancing between the PAR for a given risk factor(s), the efficacy of interventions to actually modify the risk factor, and the cost of these interventions.

AB  - This thesis aims at describing how the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is reflected in the overall operation of the Non-Governmental Organizations and government agencies working with children in street situations in Bangkok, Thailand. It describes children in different street situations in Bangkok; intervention approaches and working methods of the agencies that provide the services for them as well as similarities and differences in each group of the children. As the CRC sets a framework for interventions concerning children, it was interesting to explore whether the practitioners in Bangkok apply the convention in their interventions. This is a descriptive research applying the qualitative data collection methods by which literature review was conducted and semi-structure interviews were carried out according to a written interview guide with professionals represented NGOs and government agencies who directly work with children in street situations, followed by a deductive content analysis of the transcribed interview texts. The field observations were conducted in different areas of Bangkok in order to understand the working environments of the organizations and the conditions of the children. The findings revealfour groups of children in street situations in Bangkok with one being migrants. Their dwelling areas are determined by its socio-economic activities while the livelihoods of each group of children are different. In order to respond to their situations and promote as well as protect their rights, the NGOs and government agencies coordinate in a Network for Street Children in responding to their situations through a Street Teacher Approach. They conduct street/community outreach and responsive actions aiming at protecting, advocating for rights to education, eliminating child labor exploitation, being their significant other,facilitating durable repatriation for migrant children in street situations etc. The rights concept is universal but the childhood concept is culturally relative. The actors in Bangkok bridge the two concepts by taking the situation and the best interest of the child into consideration: they prioritize the child’s well-being which entails rights protection and promotion.

AB  - Background. Our street outreach project investigated the relationship between use of noninjecting drugs (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk-related sex behaviors of black adults. The study focused on three HIV-related risks: multiple sex partners, unprotected sex, and drugs during sex. Methods. Data for this study were collected in a street outreach community survey for a drug abuse and HIV intervention study in Birmingham, Ala. A total of 780 black men and women completed the survey. Results. High-risk sex behaviors were far more prevalent among cocaine users than marijuana or alcohol users. A greater number of cocaine users reported having multiple sex partners, not using condoms, and using drugs during sex. Female cocaine users showed the same risk level for HIV infection as male cocaine users. Conclusions. Increased risk of HIV infection through sexual transmission is associated with use of noninjecting cocaine for both men and women. Condom use should be considered as a major component of HIV prevention programs.

AB  - We evaluated an intervention to train physicians in rural China on knowledge of HIV/STI prevention, diagnosis, treatment options, and HIV/STI behavioral risk reduction counseling. This paper reports preliminary findings related to feasibility and acceptability of the program. Using a pre-post design, 69 physicians were recruited from rural county hospitals and participated in a 10-day group training program, followed by two months of clinical fieldwork and two additional weeks of training. Physicians completed baseline and six-month assessments. Patients' cohorts, recruited from clinic waiting areas of participating physicians, completed baseline and six-month HIV/STI risk assessments. Physicians reported increased knowledge of HIV biology and pathology, epidemiology, host immune response, opportunisitic infection and syndromic management, antiretroviral therapy, risk reduction counseling, and stigma reduction following the training. Patients reported improved knowledge of HIV, reduced HIV stigma, higher rates of HIV testing, and improved condom use at follow-up. The findings suggest that training physicians on HIV/STI-related knowledge and risk reduction counseling is a promising strategy for reducing HIV/STI epidemics in rural China.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Treatment for drug addiction in China can take place in mandatory detoxification centers (MDC), voluntary detoxification centers (VDC), or at outreach programs located in the community. To date little is known about HIV prevalence or associated risk factors among the current and past drug users (DU) in each setting. Methods: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at three different settings in Beijing, China; 795 subjects were enrolled at MDC, 824 at VDC, and 520 within the community. Subjects who provided informed consent took part in face-to-face interviews and provided blood samples for HIV and syphilis testing. Results: Significant differences were found across enrollment sites in terms of demographic, drug use and sexual behavior characteristics. Overall HIV sero-prevalence was 2.9%, and was particularly high in MDC (5.2% versus 1.0% in VDC and 2.3% among community drug users). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for HIV infection were 50.5 (95% CI: 19.07–133.85) for being of Yi ethnicity, 29.4 (95% CI: 15.10–57.24) for Uyghur ethnicity, 3.4 (95% CI: 1.57–7.52) for injection drug users who did not share equipment, and 18.8 (95% CI: 8.31–42.75) among injection drug users who shared injection equipment. Conclusions: The vast differences among DU in various enrollment sites in terms of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and HIV related risk profiles underscore the importance of familiarity with population characteristics and drug user environment to better inform targeted prevention programs. Prevention programs targeting DU in Chinese settings must also consider differences in ethnicities, culture, and residential status.

AB  - Purpose: Sickle cell disease is estimated to occur in 1:300-400 African-American births, with higher rates among immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean, and is less common among Hispanic births. This study determined sickle cell disease incidence among New York State newborns stratified by maternal race/ethnicity and nativity. Methods: Newborns with confirmed sickle cell disease born to New York State residents were identified by the New York State newborn screening program for the years 2000-2008 and matched to birth records to obtain birth and maternal information. Annual incidence rates were computed and bivariate analyses were conducted to examine associations with maternal race/ethnicity and nativity. Results: From 2000 to 2008, 1,911 New York State newborns were diagnosed with sickle cell disease and matched to the birth certificate files. One in every 1,146 live births was diagnosed with sickle cell disease. Newborns of non-Hispanic black mothers accounted for 86% of sickle cell disease cases whereas newborns of Hispanic mothers accounted for 12% of cases. The estimated incidence was 1:230 live births for non-Hispanic black mothers, 1:2,320 births for Hispanic mothers, and 1:41,647 births for non-Hispanic white mothers. Newborns of foreign-born non-Hispanic black mothers had a twofold higher incidence of sickle cell disease than those born to US-born non-Hispanic black mothers (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This study provides the first US estimates of sickle cell disease incidence by maternal nativity. Women born outside the United States account for the majority of children with sickle cell disease born in New York State. Such findings identify at-risk populations and inform outreach activities that promote ongoing, high-quality medical management to affected children. Genet Med 2013:15(3):222-228

AB  - Objective: Homeless patients are a vulnerable population with a higher incidence of using the emergency department (ED) for noncrisis care. Multiple charity programs target their outreach toward improving the health of homeless patients, but few data are available on the effectiveness of reducing ED recidivism. The aim of this study is to determine whether inappropriate ED use for nonemergency care may be reduced by providing charity insurance and assigning homeless patients to a primary care physician (PCP) in an outpatient clinic setting. Methods: A retrospective medical records review of homeless patients presenting to the ED and receiving treatment between July 2013 and June 2014 was completed. Appropriate vs inappropriate use of the ED was determined using the New York University ED Algorithm. The association between patients with charity care coverage, PCP assignment status, and appropriate vs inappropriate ED use was analyzed and compared. Results: Following New York University ED Algorithm standards, 76% of all ED visits were deemed inappropriate with approximately 77% of homeless patients receiving charity care and 74% of patients with no insurance seeking noncrisis health care in the ED (P=.112). About 50% of inappropriate ED visits and 43.84% of appropriate ED visits occurred in patients with a PCP assignment (P=.019). Conclusions: Both charity care homeless patients and those without insurance coverage tend to use the ED for noncrisis care resulting in high rates of inappropriate ED use. Simply providing charity care and/or PCP assignment does not seem to sufficiently reduce inappropriate ED use in homeless patients. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Cesarean section rates have risen dramatically in China within the past 25 years, particularly driven by non-medical factors and maternal requests. One major reason women request cesareans is the fear of labor pain, in a country where a minority of women are given any form of pain relief during labor. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with 26 postpartum women and 8 providers at a Shanghai district hospital in June and July of 2015, this article elucidates how perceptions of labor pain and the environment of pain relief constructs the cesarean on maternal request. In particular, many women feared labor pain and, in a context without effective pharmacological pain relief or social support during labor, they came to view cesarean sections as a way to negotiate their labor pain. In some cases, women would request cesarean sections during labor as an expression of their pain and a call for a response to their suffering. However, physicians, under recent state policy, deny such requests, particularly as they do not view pain as a reasonable indication for a cesarean birth. This disconnect leads to a mismatch in goals for the experience of birth. To reduce unnecessary C-sections, policy makers should instead address the lack of pain relief during childbirth and develop other means of improving the childbirth experience that may relieve maternal anxiety, such as allowing family members to support the laboring woman and integrating a midwifery model for low-risk births within China's maternal-services system.

AB  - This research was previously published in the International Journal of Knowledge and Systems Science (IJKSS), 8(2); edited by W.B. Lee, pages 1-16, copyright year 2017 by IGI Publishing (an imprint of IGI Global). Cyber youth work is a pioneering and proactive approach used by non-government organizations to address the changing needs of the youth groups, particularly those at-risk and 'hidden' young people. This paper describes the development process of a social media mining and analysis method, which is built to facilitate services for cyber youth work. The method incorporates an iterative method for collecting, selecting and extracting domain keywords in selected social media. A hybrid approach which combines heuristic rules and n-gram analysis for bilingual word segmentation has been developed. Then, social network analysis is used to analyze the extracted results. A pilot study has been done by using drug abuse as the study topic. It demonstrated high potential of the method to enhance cyber youth work. The weights deduced by the method have found to have a positive correlation with the benchmarked scores. It helps to understand the characteristic of the network, identify target clients, and provide data support for marking decisions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - China is now facing an unprecedented demographic transition given its fast growingaging population. On the one hand, the family as the main resource of elderly care hasdramatically weakened by its miniaturization and changes in living arrangements. Onthe other, the underdevelopment of social services and social security system cannotmeet the enormous and ever-increasing long-term care (LTC) needs for Chinese elders,both of which highlights the challenges in LTC for the elderly.Considering the aforementioned phenomena and my personal work experiences,a reasonable implication was that a substantial proportion of older Chinesepeople with LTC needs are deprived of a minimum standard of living because theyhave to rely on others for daily living, and many of them have limited financial andsocial resources. Thus, this study endeavors to answer the following questions: (A)What are the social expectations on living standard for older adults with LTC needs inurban China? (B) How do these expectations vary among population with differentdemographic and socioeconomic background? (C) How deprived are older Chinesepeople with LTC needs from a social consensus standard of living? (D) What are thecharacteristics of older people with LTC needs who suffer deprivation? Furthermore,what are the determinants of deprivation? What are its risk factors and protective factors?These are important questions for the elderly population in Chinese, their families, and policy makers. Until recently, however, few studies can provide evidence addressingsuch questions. This doctoral research aims to fill that gap.The fieldwork of this study was conducted in Guangzhou (GZ) from July of2017 to September of 2018. Firstly, taking reference from the “deprivation approach”in poverty research (Townsend, 2006), a social consensus of standard of living forolder people with LTC needs was established by identifying social consensus items ofnecessities, which was initially proposed by older people, their caregivers, and the expertsin LTC through focus groups. Secondly, the proposed list of 55 social consensusitems of necessities was identified later through a survey based on an effective samplewith more than 1,400 individuals aged 50 or above in GZ. Thirdly, a questionnairewas administered to 256 older community dwellers with LTC needs to measure theprevalence of deprivation of living standard through a face-to-face interview. Dataanalysis was firstly applied to test the correlation between the incidence of deprivationand predisposing characteristics of the respondents, their resource available and needfactors based on the Anderson’s Behavior Model (BM) (Anderson, 1995). Subsequently,a binary logistic regression model was conducted to predict the incidence ofthe deprivation of standard of living.The findings showed that all the 55 necessities items gained an 80% and abovesupportive rate among the 50+ population in GZ. However, male respondents, older people, those with lower socioeconomic status or urban residency, and having personalin long-term care, either as care receiver or caregiver, showed much lower expectationon later life living standard than their counterparts.As to the deprivation rate, the means of deprivation index score (MDIS) of thesample is 6.10, which means that on average, those with long-term care needs are deprivedin 6.1 items out of 50 social consensus necessities. Respondents with malegender, younger in age, never married or divorced, with lower socioeconomic statusin education, household income and pension income, live alone, suffered from morenumber of diseases bear a higher likelihood to be deprived. In the final simplifiedmodel of binary logistic regression, six independent variables (education, occupation,Lubben index of social networks, the willingness of caregiver to provider care, subjectivepoverty, and number of diseases) predicted 80.7% of the incidence of deprivation.The logistic regression model was significant (χ2 (10) = 81.541, p < .0005) with 2log likelihood value of 210.441 after 7 iterations, and with Nagelkerke R2 equaled to0.404.The scale and quality of social network and the willingness of caregiver toprovide care were the key protective factors; while the number of illnesses sufferedwere the key risk factor of deprivation for those with LTC needs in China. Implicationsfocus on these protective and risk factors were discussed for social policy andLTC practice in China.This is the unprecedented study to address the living standard of older people with LTC in mainland China. Also, the novel utilization of the “deprivation approach”contributes to the methodologies of measuring the standard of living for older people.In addition, this research contributes to the Anderson’s behavior model in LTC utilizationto predict the deprivation of elders with LTC needs, which expands and revisesthe Anderson’s Behavior Model (BM). Empirically, this research provide a better pictureof the living standard of older people with LTC needs in China. Furthermore, riskfactors and protective factors were analyzed to enhance our understanding of the deprivationregarding their deprivation. . Practically, empirical data from this researchhelp caregiver, service provider and policy maker to understand and improve thestandard of living of older people with LTC needs.Alternate abstract:中国目前正面临着显著的人口老龄化。一方面，由于家庭规模小型化和居住安排的转变，家庭作为老年护理资源主要渠道的能力在急剧削弱;另一方面，社会服务和社会保障不发达，不能满足中国老年人长期照护服务日益增长的巨大需求，造成老年人长期照护这一社会问题日益突出。基于上述事实和笔者个人从事养老工作的经验,可以作出一个合理的假设：相当大部分有长期照护需要的中国老年人，由于他们在日常活动能力的下降和经济和社会资源的不足，造成他们生活水平无法达到社会认可的最低生活水平。因此，本研究试图回答以下问题: (一)社会大众对于中国城市中有长期照护需求的老年人的生活水平的期望是怎样的? (二)不同的人口和社会经济背景的人们，对上述期望有何不同? (三)有长期照护需求的中国老年人匮乏程度如何?(四)经历匮乏的有长期照护需求老年人的特征是什么？匮乏的决定因素是什么?其危险因素和保护因素又有哪些？这些问题对中国的老年人、他们的家庭和老年政策制定者都至关重要。然而，直到最近，很少有研究能提供证据来解决这些问题。这项博士研究旨在填补这一空白。本研究于2017 年7 月至2018 年9 月在广州省广州市开展。首先，参照贫困研究中的“匮乏研究”(Townsend, 2006)的定义，通过确定社会大众对生活必需品的共识，建立了有长期照护需求老年人生活水平公认标准。该标准最初是由老年人、他们的照护者和长期照护专家通过焦点小组提出，后经一项针对1400 名50 岁以上的广州居民开展的社会调查问卷得到证实。最后，笔者向256 名有长期照护需求的60 岁以上社区居家养老的老年人发放了一份调查问卷，以测量他们的生活水平的匮乏程度。数据分析首先参照Anderson 的行为模型(Anderson, 1995)检验匮乏发生率与被调查者在诱发因素、资源因素、需求因素等方面的特征之间的相关性，然后采用二元逻辑回归模型预测了匮乏的发生率。研究结果表明，所有的55 必需生活条件获得80%以上的支持率。其中，男性受访者、高龄、社会经济地位较低、城区居民和有更多的长期照护经验的受访者，对于晚年生活水平的期望低于其他群体。在匮乏率方面，样本人群的平均匮乏指数得分(MDIS)为6.10，即平均而言，有长期护理需求的样本人群在50 项社会公认的必需品中有6.1 项是匮乏的。调查对象性别为男性、年龄较小、从未结过婚或离婚、受教育程度较低、家庭收入和养老金收入较低、独居、患有较多疾病，生活在匮乏中的可能性较高。在最终的二元逻辑回归简化模型中，六个自变量（受教育程度、职业、陆斌社会网络指数、照顾者对提供者照顾的意愿、主观贫困、疾病数量）预测了80.7%的匮乏发生率。逻辑回归模型显著(χ2 (10)= 81.541, p < .0005)，2 对数似然值为210.441, Nagelkerke R2 = 0.404。社会网络的规模、质量和照顾者对提供者照顾的意愿是主要的保护因素;而老年人患病数量是我国有长期照护需求老年人生活匮乏的主要危险因素。论文进一步探讨了这些保护性和风险性因素对我国社会政策和长期照护实践的启示。理论方面，本研究是首次针对中国有长期照护需求老年人进，基于“匮乏理论”的研究方法开展的生活水平研究；此外，本研究运用Anderson 的行为模型预测有长期照护需求老年人的生活匮乏情况，扩展和修正了该行为模型的内容，扩大了其使用范围。经验上，该实证研究为我国有长期照护需求的老年人的生活水平提供了客观全面的测量依据。此外，还对生活匮乏的风险因素和保护因素进行了分析，以加深我们对我国长期照护现状的认识。实务上，本研究的实证数据有助于护理人员、服务提供者和决策者提高有长期照护需求老年人的生活水平。关键词：生活水平，长期护理，贫困，老年人

AB  - Burnout is a worldwide phenomenon among social welfare workers. This study examined how burnout affects student social workers and professional social workers. It first examined the construct validity of the Maslach Burnout Inventory‐General Survey (MBI‐GS) scale, using data from two Chinese samples (848 student social workers and 748 professional social workers). The original three‐factor model was regarded as superior to other competing models. Investigation of the second‐order factor model indicated that exhaustion and cynicism are core components but that personal efficacy is not. The research also revealed the differential predictability of the three subscales of the MBI‐GS. Our expectation that differential patterns of effects could be predicted was largely supported. Professional efficacy plays a key mediating role in the relationship between student social workers' professional identity and their satisfaction with fieldwork, while social workers' cynicism is the main mediator in the relationship between their professional identity and turnover intention. Therefore, identifying at‐risk students and professional social workers to undertake appropriate intervention strategies that focus on both their professional identity and different dimensions of burnout may be an effective way to prevent students' dissatisfaction and reduce social worker turnover.

AB  - Background: To successfully develop and implement school-based sexual health interventions for adolescent girls, such as screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, it is important to understand parents' and teachers' attitudes towards sexual health education and acceptability of sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening interventions. Methods: In this qualitative study, we approached parents and teachers from three high schools to participate in in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus-group discussions (FGDs). Parents and teachers were asked about their general knowledge of STIs and sexual health education. In addition, they were asked whether they would support utilizing outreach to schools to facilitate provision of sexual health education and screening for STIs in adolescent girls. Data were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. An initial coding matrix was developed and refined throughout the coding process. Transcripts were coded by two researchers and analyzed using the content analysis approach. Results: We conducted 10 IDIs (5 parents and 5 teachers) and 4 FGDs (2 with parents, 2 with teachers, total of 26 participants). Most parents reported few or no discussions regarding STIs with their adolescent girls. Parents were more comfortable discussing consequences of sexual activity including loss of virginity and the potential for pregnancy. Parents tended to place responsibility for sexual health education with teachers. The teachers, in turn, provided basic sexual and reproductive health education including puberty, abstinence, and overview of STIs. Both parents and teachers found the idea of screening for STIs in adolescent girls to be acceptable, and were comfortable with research staff contacting girls through informational meetings at schools. Parents felt that adolescents' STI screening results should be shared with their parents. Conclusion: In this African setting, parents and teachers provide limited sexual health education, with a focus on negative consequences including loss of virginity, pregnancy, and risk for STIs. Nonetheless, both parents and teachers were supportive of STI screening for adolescent girls, beginning with school-based informational meetings for the girls. Research and programs that aim to provide STI screening in this setting must offer treatment and address the issue of whether results will be disclosed to parents.

AB  - An urban university music education department and an outreach organization partnered to provide after-school music classes for at-risk children. Fourteen music education majors were recruited to teach 125 first through fifth graders (6-12 years of age), whose ethnicity was 55 percent Hispanic and 45 percent African-American. Classes included general music, recorder, and choir. Musical preference measures indicated significant differences among grades, except for two pieces that reflected the ethnicity of the students. Pre-service teachers were most successful at teaching moving, performing, and listening to a variety of music, and least successful at teaching composing and improvising; and they were able to achieve all of the stated goals for a successful urban youth program, especially being a positive force and musical mentor, and making the experience enjoyable, challenging, and extraordinary for the children.

AB  - The historical development of the Education Welfare Service (EWS) in GB is examined, along with Victorian discourse on schooling. This discourse, in assuming that universal school attendance was natural & necessary, provided the rationale for the introduction of compulsory schooling, & contributed to the pathologization of truancy, which has involved the categorization of truants as fearful (school phobic & abused) & endangered (delinquent & morally endangered), & the regulation of truants & their families. It is argued that the dichotomy between "care" & "control" measures, based on notions of respectability & the nature & extent of individual deviance, is central to an understanding of these processes of categorization & regulation; this is illustrated via analysis of 1988-1990 fieldwork with the EWS in North Midlands. The potential impact of the Children Act of 1989 on the EWS is also considered. 2 Tables, 73 References. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Examines homelessness in England via three research projects. The largest, an urban-based study sponsored by the Economic & Social Research Council, involved fieldwork in Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, & Birmingham, 1992-1995. It included 100 in-depth interviews with homeless young people as well as interviews with representatives from statutory & voluntary agencies. Two smaller, rural-based projects consisted of 50 focused interviews in Shropshire in 1992 & 10 in-depth interviews in northern Wales in 1998. To start, 6 homeless young adults relate their personal stories. The homelessness research literature is reviewed, & the practice of social ethnography is described both in general & in relation to the current project. An overview of legislative responses to vagrancy & homelessness since medieval times is presented. Detailed description & analysis of the case studies are followed by the development of substantive arguments stemming from the tension between theory & method. Other topics include gendered meanings of home & homelessness; the importance of home to identity construction; ways of becoming homeless; the invisibility of homeless crime victims; & the regulation of homeless spaces. The book contains a Chronology of the criminalization of homelessness, Prologue, Epilogue, Glossary, & 6 Chpts. 12 Figures, Bibliog. J. Lindroth

AB  - This report of the achievements of an experimental multiservice center in London for older street people begins with reviews of the types of long-term accommodation available for resettlement and the work of its outreach team, 24-hour open access rooms, and residential, assessment, and resettlement services. Two outcomes are examined: whether users returned to the streets and whether they were resettled in long-term housing. Those with alcohol dependency were most difficult to resettle. Logistic regression analyses of the factors influencing the two outcomes indicate that the duration of residence in the center was the predominant influence.

AB  - Since its founding, the United Nations has included among its goals poverty eradication, food security, ``health for all,{''} universal literacy and education, protection of the environment, and the end of social discrimination. Special international mobilizations for one particular goal (or a particular set of goals) have taken place several times during the past 50 years. The UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) movement is that latest and perhaps the most politically committed of these initiatives. UN summit declarations and subsequent international activism are beneficial at all levels: as a result of their momentum, policies are enhanced, funds raised, and programs implemented. However, there are sometimes unintended effects at the field level, where great pressure is put on project managers and staff to change approaches, invest money, scale up activities, and get ``visible{''} results in a short time. The present case study illustrates such side effects in the context of the FAO Special Program for Food Security (SPFS) in Guatemala. The study argues that poverty and hunger reduction require long-term fieldwork and steady impact monitoring, and that the MDG-related ``scaling up{''} of development projects and programs should be adjusted to the local pace.

AB  - This thesis explores adult-child relationships and the use of touch in residential child care. The discourses surrounding touch in residential child care are distinctly polarised: touch is identified as being both fundamental to child development and also feared as a result of increasing risk aversion resulting from the legacy of abuse scandals in the sector (Cooke, 2003; Steckley, 2012). There is currently a dearth of empirical research regarding how touch is used in residential child care, particularly with regards to observations of touch in practice. This research therefore contributes to filling this gap in research by utilising ethnographic methods of participant observation, semi-structured and ethnographic interviews to explore how staff members and children conceptualise, use and/or avoid physical touch in day-to-day practice. This research is examined through a lifespace framework and draws upon theories of intimacy in order to link the findings to wider sociological theories of relationships (Smith, 2005; Jamieson, 1998, 2011). By carrying out sustained observations of practice, this research examines how touch, as a facet of adult-child relationships in residential child care, is negotiated within the lifespace. It shows how intimacy is both cultivated and inhibited, thus contributing theoretically to wider sociological debates concerning adult-child relationships and touching practices, particularly in relation to professional relationships and intimacy (Morgan, 2009; Ferguson, 2011a). The fieldwork for this project took place over 6 months at Sunnydale House, a local authority children’s home in England. The findings suggest that touch is used much more regularly than has been previously suggested in literature (Ward, 1999; Cooke, 2003), that the majority of touch is instigated by children not workers and that recent organisational culture shifts have shaped the way that workers conceptualise touch. The findings also illustrate the complex range of factors which influence how touch is inhibited, including: risk aversion, emotional burn out, bureaucracy and the construction of children in care as ‘moral dirt’ (Ferguson, 2007). The thesis concludes by producing a typology of touching practices which synthesises the range of meanings behind the uses - and avoidance - of touch in residential child care practice. This typology is also used to re-conceptualise intimacy in professional relationships in a way that accounts for the messy ambiguity of adult-child relationships in the lifespace.

AB  - HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender (TG) women remains low in Thailand. The HIV prevention program (PREV) to increase HIV testing and link those who tested HIV-positive to care provided trainings to peer educators to conduct target mapping, identify high risk MSM and TG women through outreach education and offer them rapid HIV testing. Trained hospital staff provided HIV testing and counseling with same-day results at hospitals and mobile clinics and referred HIV-positive participants for care and treatment. We used a standardized HIV pre-test counseling form to collect participant characteristics and analyzed HIV test results using Poisson regression and Wilcoxon rank sum trend tests to determine trends over time. We calculated HIV incidence using data from participants who initially tested HIV-negative and tested at least one more time during the program. Confidence intervals for HIV incidence rates were calculated using the Exact Poisson method. From September 2011 through August 2016, 5,629 participants had an HIV test; their median age was 24 years, 1,923 (34%) tested at mobile clinics, 5,609 (99.6%) received their test result, and 1,193 (21%) tested HIV positive. The number of people testing increased from 458 in 2012 to 1,832 in 2016 (p < 0.001). Participants testing at mobile clinics were younger (p < 0.001) and more likely to be testing for the first time (p < 0.001) than those tested at hospitals. Of 1,193 HIV-positive participants, 756 (63%) had CD4 testing. Among 925 participants who returned for HIV testing, HIV incidence was 6.2 per 100 person-years. Incidence was highest among people 20-24 years old (10.9 per 100 person-years). HIV testing among MSM and TG women increased during the PREV program. HIV incidence remains alarmingly high especially among young participants. There is an urgent need to expand HIV prevention services to MSM and TG women in Thailand.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in women veterans (WVs), and associated with significant co-morbidity. Effective treatment is available; however, PTSD is often unrecognized. OBJECTIVES: Identify PTSD prevalence and mental healthcare (MHC) use in a representative national WV sample. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional, population-based 2008-2009 national survey of 3,611 WVs, weighted to the population. MAIN MEASURES: We screened for PTSD using a validated instrument, and also assessed demographic characteristics, health characteristics, and MHC use in the prior 12 months. Among those screening positive, we conducted multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors of MHC use. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 13.0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 9.8-16.2) of WVs screened PTSD-positive. Veterans Health Administration (VA) healthcare was used by 31.1 % of PTSD-positives and 11.4 % of PTSD-negatives ( p < 0.001). Among those screening positive, 48.7 % (95 % CI 35.9-61.6) used MHC services (66.3 % of VA-users, 40.8 % of VA-nonusers; p < 0.001). Having a diagnosis of depression (OR = 8.6; 95 % CI 1.5-48.9) and VA healthcare use (OR = 2.7; 95 % CI 1.1-7.0) predicted MHC use, whereas lacking a regular provider for health care (OR = 0.2; 95 % CI 0.1-0.4) and household income below the federal poverty level (OR = 0.2; 95 % CI 0.1-0.5) predicted nonuse. CONCLUSIONS: More than one in eight WVs screened positive for PTSD. Though a majority of VA-users received MHC, low income predicted nonuse. Only a minority of VA-nonusers received MHC. The majority of WVs use non-VA healthcare providers, who may be unaware of their veteran status and PTSD risk. VA outreach to educate VA-nonusers and their healthcare providers about WVs' PTSD risk and available evidence-based VA treatment options is one approach to extend the reach of VA MHC. Research to characterize barriers to VA MHC use for VA-nonusers and low income VA-users is warranted to better understand low service utilization, and to inform program development to engage more WVs in needed MHC.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation is to explore the phenomenon of street homelessness and the variety of social responses to it. As an understudied subpopulation, the street homeless are viewed as exceptionally problematic, because they call into question not only social structures which predicate homelessness itself, but also the way in which we provide homeless services. Our data come from more than three years of ethnographic fieldwork, during which we spent time with the street homeless in their camps and work corners and also in the shelters. Additionally, we interviewed and observed service users, service providers, politicians, police officers, and others to map the positions of various groups. Using grounded theory, our data was coded and emergent themes developed. We innovate on grounded theory by employing fractal concept analysis to build these emergent themes into conceptual models so that thematic content in our data is systematically linked with broader cultural themes. By using fractal analysis we can retain a systematic vision of conceptual architecture, rather than being relegated to conceptual pieces and forced linear relationships between them. From the merging of these two analytic techniques, we conclude our work first by presenting our thematic findings and then by building fractal conceptual models from them. The latter highlight the conceptual disconnects between society and the street homeless and contain also our suggestions about how to restructure homeless service provision.

AB  - Measured the impact of an assertive case management program for psychiatrically disabled homeless persons in metropolitan Toronto. It was hypothesized that the program would improve residential stability, reduce psychiatric symptoms, improve social functioning, improve social networks, and increase use of appropriate services. 59 clients were assessed during the 9 mo before and 9 mo after program entry. At follow-up, significant improvements in residential stability and reductions in psychopathology were demonstrated. Improvements in social functioning and increases in social network size were significant. Although no baseline data about service use were collected, Ss used basic support services during their 1st 9 mo in the program. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Shelters for abused women have expanded from “safe havens” to providing a range of residential and outreach services, and face increasing pressure to demonstrate “value for money” by providing evaluation metrics that may or may not reflect what they actually do. We conducted interviews and surveys with 68 shelter directors in Ontario, Canada, and found that differences in service philosophy and how abuse is defined influence decisions about who receives services and the shelter’s role in the broader community; these in turn affect how the work of shelters is positioned. Implications for shelter service evaluation are discussed.

AB  - Introduction. Limited information is available on the effect of income level on whether people visit a dentist for preventive care, whereas more has been written regarding the effect of income on ``any{''} dental visits-which may include emergencies. Also, little is known of the effects of ``near-poor{''} income (101 to 200 percent of the U.S. federal poverty level) on dental visits and preventive dental visits.-The authors examined the impact of income at the ``poor{''} and ``near-poor{''} poverty levels on preventive dental visits made by children and adolescents. Methods. The authors used data from the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for children and adolescents younger than 19 years of age to estimate the percentage of this group who had had preventive dental visits. They performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to adjust poverty levels by race and ethnicity age and sex. Results. The distribution of preventive dental visits for those who were poor was similar to that for those who were near-poor, but the percentage distribution of ventive visits for children and adolescents with higher income was significanly different from that for those in the lower income groups. This was true across-all variables considered. Conclusions. It is important to evaluate and monitor preventive care utilization trends for U.S. children and adolescents in the poor and near-poor categories separately, particularly in states that do not provide similar levels of access under the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP. Enrollment of eligible children in Medicaid and SCHIP via oral health promotion outreach efforts, access to care and utilization of dental prime and a secondary care services must be increased.

AB  - Background: The impact that poverty can have on children and young people (CYP) is pervasive and can affect their emotional wellbeing, educational attainment, future life chances and can put pressure on family relationships. It is known that the impact of poverty can also create a number of barriers to CYP and families accessing services that aim to promote their well-being. Furthermore, structural factors such as current welfare cuts and austerity measures on public services mean that professionals working with people affected by poverty will have to ‘do more with less’. Practitioners could fail to acknowledge this if they have little experience of poverty through their professional discourses and training. This could reinforce barriers, create a social distance between service-users and practitioners and a misalignment of assessment of priorities which could lead to inappropriate interventions being offered. Aims: This study gathered the views of 10 Art Therapists working in areas of multiple deprivation with the aim of examining their perspectives and experiences of poverty and how it is explored – if at all - within their professional practice. Also examined is the impact that working in a context of multiple deprivation has – if any – upon (i) what constitutes ‘therapy’ and (ii) the practices of the art therapist. Methodology: The inclusion criteria for participants was that they were qualified art therapists working with CYP in West Central Scotland (WCS) in an area of Multiple Deprivation (MD) as determined by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD). The principle data collection method consisted of semi-structured interviews, and supplementary contextualising data was gathered via fieldwork in order to make observations of the context, settings and localities where participants worked. Reflexivity was also used to process personal and professional feelings regarding the data gleaned from interviews and fieldwork. The data was analysed using thematic analysis that took a general inductive approach to generating themes. This was then triangulated with the other data gathered to enhance the validity of emergent themes.

AB  - Examined behavior change associated with a street-based acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) education project targeted to iv drug users. Two cross-sections (438 Ss in 1986 and 623 Ss in 1987) were sampled from drug detoxification clinics and street locations. Significant increases were reported in (1) the percentage of Ss who used bleach to decontaminate syringes and did not share needles in the past year and (2) condom use. A significant reduction in an index of the number of needle-sharing partners was reported. Ss ranked treatment programs as the most important source of AIDS information before implementation of the education program, and outreach workers as most important after implementation. Findings suggest that the community-based outreach program had at least some impact on knowledge about AIDS and led to prevention of and reductions in behaviors known to transmit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

AB  - This booklet is designed to give Peace Corps country directors, staff, and volunteers ideas and examples of how they can assist youth-at-risk through government agencies and private organizations working with youth in their host countries. It begins with an overview of the problems of youth-at-risk, followed by six scenarios. Each scenario is designed to stimulate thought about greater Peace Corps involvement in youth programs already in place, as well as to encourage the development of new program initiatives. The scenarios illustrate a range of possible program areas and volunteer roles based on a composite of what other organizations around the world have done. Each scenario includes: (1) a profile of a youth-at-risk affected by a specific problem addressed in that scenario; (2) a problems statement; (3) a discussion of the problem; and (4) possible Peace Corps involvement in addressing the problems based on a hypothetical situation developed from the experiences of other organizations serving youth-at-risk in one or more countries. The final section addresses the possibility of volunteers working with youth-at-risk as a secondary assignment. (JB)

AB  - Guidance strategies play an important role in reintegrating young people who have dropped out of the formal education, training, and employment system and must include support for nonformal guidance agents in the community. A European program has explored three strategies for linking formal and nonformal guidance structures to provide social support for and reintegrate the target group into the formal system: help nonformal guidance agents act as referral points for linking the target group to the formal guidance system; help them be initial deliverers of guidance; and help the formal guidance providers develop new methods for working with the nonformal guidance providers and target group. Issues raised by national projects designed to provide training for nonformal guidance agents include the following: levels of formality; voluntary versus paraprofessional roles; progression and certification; gender issues; links with formal guidance providers; other agendas; sustainability; evaluation; and replication and dissemination. Within a proposed model, the European Commission and national government departments responsible for the formal system have a concern about the young people who have fallen out of this system or are at risk. They look to the formal guidance services to help the target group remain in or be reintegrated into the formal system. The services look to nonformal guidance agents, intermediaries, or methods to develop effective ways of working with the young people. (YLB)

AB  - The British Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility (BOSCORF) provides long-term curation and archiving of sediment cores collected by the UK's geoscience community. The collection consists of 8,900 m of core composed of 2,400 individual marine sediment cores and is stored at a dedicated facility at the National Oceanography Centre (NOC). BOSCORF has taken an increasingly active role in geoscience outreach at a multitude of scales. The repository forms an essential component of formal visitor tours to the NOC. Annually hosting educational sessions for high-school students, engages with regionally active geological interest groups and recently, participating in large scale public science events. BOSCORF has utilised the recent NERC funded project: the Arctic Landslide Tsunami Project, and developed an activity that can be adapted to the needs of specific audiences. The activity focusses on the Storegga Slides, and the history of tsunamis and volcanic eruptions to have affected the UK. To appeal to a wide range of audiences, this outreach activity places emphasis on constructivist learning, relating complex scientific concepts such as sedimentation rates, tephrochronology and turbidites to recent examples of volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. Using a sediment core as a visual guide, participants are guided through a history of geohazards, and given a range of statistics and facts relating to the visible event in the sediment core (e.g. Holocene tephra). This information is then compared with a similar event occurring today (e.g. 48 x the size of the Eyjafjallajökull eruption). The focus is on risk to UK populations which leads a targeted discussion on hazard mitigation, policy and future research, and the role that BOSCORF has in achieving these goals. In addition, a range of unique and varied peripheral activities have been included to interest stakeholders from varied backgrounds. These have included 3D printed foraminifera, peat cores containing tsunami deposits and a "tsunami" generator in a paddling pool. The use of a currently research-active scientific resource does present some challenges for BOSCORF, but through collaboration with the NOC Communications department, these issues have been managed, and this resource should be available for several years.The "storytelling" approach, using a deep marine sediment core as a timeline to frame a complex problem, captures the imagination of those who engage with the activity. A focus on training staff to encourage the participant to reflect on their new knowledge (tsunamis in the UK) and develop this interest through guided questioning (where could this happen, why could this happen, how can you tell this happened), is essential to avoiding the feeling of being "lectured at" by a scientist. This approach helps to make participants feel involved, and to understand why facilities such as BOSCORF exist, why they are tax-payer funded and the relevance of the science. It is also essential to ensure an understanding of the limitations of the science is effectively communicated, and that they will encounter research similar to this in the press, and to think critically about how it is reported.

AB  - A field study of Cherokee Indians in Eastern Oklahoma revealed the following information: (1) educators were ignorant of and indifferent to the language, values, and cultural traditions of the Tribal (rural) Cherokee; (2) the Tribal Cherokees were an impoverished people; (3) both adults and children were educationally disadvantaged; and (4) Tribal Cherokee parents desired that their children obtain an education, but were critical of the schools for abusing their children. Recommendations included: (1) both English and Cherokee be officially recognized; (2) curricula be developed to teach English as a second language; (3) teachers of Cherokee children learn the language and culture of the Cherokee; and (4) special funds be allocated to study the problems of Cherokee children. An extensive history of the Cherokee Nation is included. (RH)

AB  - Proposes 4 key factors in the successful indentification and treatment of juvenile firesetters and their families, as determined in an interdisciplinary pilot program. The program is characterized by aggressive outreach to ensure that children who have been involved in firesetting receive mental health evaluations and treatment. The factors are (1) assessment of the degree of risk of recurrence, (2) the challenge of engaging families in mental health treatment, (3) close liaison and aggressive outreach by collaborating agencies, and (4) implementation of appropriate preventive intervention. Case examples of a 5-yr-old girl and a 14-yr-old boy are presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Homeless research has focused on the service-directed approach, but few qualitative studies have focused on the critical and sensitive nature of the intake process. Staff in rural and remote communities struggle to refer services and mainstream resources to homeless veterans. The purpose of this case study was to explore case managers' perspectives on intake procedures in rural Pennsylvania communities. Lewin's force field analysis was used as a theoretical basis to examine the rationale for behaviors and forces that impact an individual's state. Six case managers and 1 supervisor were selected for face-to-face interviews based on their experience, job duties, and length of time involved in homeless services. The themes that emerged from coding analysis included coordinated entry, paperwork length and redundancy, geographical barriers including transportation and employment services, identification and outreach, and case management staff. Findings may be used to improve assessment techniques and critical time intervention strategies to reduce the length of homelessness for rural veterans.

AB  - The book outlines techniques involved in intervention in a court setting, and explains why some courts are more open to successful outreach work than others. It shows how a range of services and individuals can be supported by the presence of a drug outreach worker at court. These include court staff, prosecutors, advocates and the probation service, as well as other agencies that could benefit from better access to a difficult to reach, and often marginalized, client group. Outreach work can support three principal objectives: increasing the safety of communities from drug-related crime; reducing the availability and acceptability of drugs to young people; and reducing the health risks and other damage related to drug misuse. The book examines the strengths and weaknesses of court-based outreach work; assessing suitability; pointers for successful outreach; getting started; case studies; and funds, evaluation and quality.

AB  - Objectives: This study sought to describe the recruitment of women living with HIV (WLWH) into the community-based Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS), because women are underrepresented in HIV research. Methods: There were 1,424 WLWH were enrolled from British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, who completed detailed questionnaires administered by peer research associates (PRAs; WLWH with research training). During screening, participants were asked: ``How did you hear about the study?{''} We describe recruitment strategies by subpopulation and offer reflections on challenges and successes. Results: Of 1,131 participants with complete data, 40% identified as White, 33% African/Caribbean/Black, and 19% Indigenous. The median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 37-51) and 4% identified as trans women. Overall, 35% were recruited through PRAs/peers, 34% clinics, and 19% AIDS service organizations (ASOs). PRAs/peers were the predominant recruitment method in Ontario (49%), compared with clinics in British Columbia (40%), and Quebec (43%). Nationally, PRAs/peers were more successful in recruiting WLWH commonly considered to be ``harder to reach{''} (e.g., women identifying as trans, using drugs, not receiving HIV care). Clinics were more effective in recruiting younger women (16-29 years) and women not using ASOs. Recruitment challenges centered on engaging these harder to reach women. Successes included hiring PRAs who built participant trust, linking with clinics to reach women isolated from HIV communities, involving outreach workers to engage street-involved women, and disseminating study information to diverse stakeholders. Conclusions: Having multiple approaches, engaging a diverse team of PRAs, ensuring flexibility, and cultivating reciprocal relationships with community stakeholders were key to recruiting a diverse and representative sample of WLWH.

AB  - The authors examine the common assumption that AIDS/HIV outreach prevention programs and similar programs in methadone treatment compete for the same population by comparing injecting drug users (IDUs) reached by each intervention in four communities. Similar results across sites reinforced the conclusions that, compared to IDUs entering methadone treatment, the IDUs contacted in outreach were more likely to be male, black, and young; to start injecting drugs when they were older, have shorter histories of injecting risk, and currently inject drugs less often than daily; to inject infrequently only opiates and frequently inject only cocaine; and to have not been in formal treatment ever or in the past six months.

AB  - Abstract. In 1999, the Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study surveyed 734 US college administrators to learn what colleges were doing to prevent binge drinking. Respondents rated the severity of student alcohol-abuse problems and described prevention efforts and institutional investments in prevention infrastructure. Prevention practices were widespread in the areas of general education about alcohol, use of policy controls to limit access to alcohol, restricting advertising at home-game sporting events, and allocation of living space to alcohol-free dormitories. Programming was less prevalent for more targeted alcohol education, outreach, and restrictions on alcohol advertising in campus media. Nationally, most of the surveyed colleges reported having a campus alcohol specialist, many had task forces, and about half were performing in-house data collection. Less common were program evaluations, community agreements, or neighborhood ex changes. Prevention practices varied with institutional characteristics and the surveyed administrators' perceptions of the severity of alcohol problems.

AB  - This thesis is based on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in Agincourt, South Africa, between 2009 and 2010. It examines social relations of care involving young people in the context of the country's AIDS epidemic and increasing economic inequality. The thesis focuses on three sets of care relations, which constitute gift exchanges involving young (orphaned and non-orphaned) people: 1) children's labour for guardian care; 2) girls' labour and sex for support from boys and men; and 3) the local manufacturing of 'orphans' for charitable gifts from tourist-philanthropists. The thesis further examines how the contested constructions of orphanhood, childhood and care are expressed through these three sets of relations. It theorises how Western and local constructions of care, childhood and orphanhood meet on the ground through orphan-targeted assistance. Evidence derives from ethnographic fieldwork carried out with two non-profit organisations serving 'Orphans and Vulnerable Children' (OVCs) in two separate villages, as well as with 14 households connected to the OVC organisations. Ongoing, semi-structured interviews were carried out with young people and significant adult caregivers from participant households. Participatory exercises, including a photography project and a 'Girls Club,' were also carried out with young participants. Interviews with key stakeholders involved in the OVC care scene were conducted. Stakeholders included local government workers and officials, faith-based leaders and staff from private tourist game lodges conducting community development projects involving young people in Agincourt. This thesis develops the concept of the 'materiality of care' to address the dearth of ethnographically informed theorisations of care involving young peopled affected by AIDS and poverty. It argues that understandings of care for and by young (orphaned) people must be placed within local, emic perspectives and practices of care, as well as within the broader, historical and political economic context shaping relations of care. Findings have implications for policies and interventions for young people people affected by AIDS and poverty. The thesis contributes to the growing body of evidence that is critical of orphan-targeted interventions in sub-Saharan Africa; interventions which fail to recognise the familial context of parentless children and the broader context of poverty and hardships caused by AIDS that cut across the lives of orphaned and non-orphaned young people.

AB  - The numerically large and growing Indochinese refugee population has been little studied with respect to infant health. It is a population that is young, is experiencing high fertility, late onset of prenatal care, and is characterized by low socioeconomic status. Thus, it presents a high risk profile with respect to infant mortality. Using linked birth and infant death records for the San Diego metropolitan area for the period 1978-85 infant mortality rates (IMRs) were calculated for Indochinese refugee groups from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in comparison with other ethnic groups. We found, surprisingly, that Indochinese refugees as a group had an IMR below that for non-Hispanic Whites and substantially below that for Blacks. In general, IMRs for Indochinese refugees were similar to those for other Asian groups. These findings held even after controlling for birth weight and onset of prenatal care. The timing and causes of death suggest areas in which the IMR could drop to even lower levels with improved community outreach programs, especially among refugee groups from Laos (Hmong and Lao) who exhibited the unusual pattern of higher post-early neonatal than early neonatal mortality.

AB  - Gender relations and roles, ethnic identity, poverty, and local circumstances, including drug-related epidemics such as HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), constitute powerful social forces that create a unique set of risky conditions for women drug users. This paper presents findings from a community-based AIDS prevention research project for 1,022 out-of-treatment drug users recruited through street outreach and targeted sampling. Participants were 791 men (mean age 38.4 yrs) and 231 women(mean age 36.5 yrs). Data from a baseline risk behavior assessment and in-depth interviews on contexts of women's drug use show different patterns of use when comparing women to men, and among women comparing African Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Whites. Related differences in prevalence of HIV, STDs, and other consequences of drug use and addiction also are presented. Implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the development of drug treatment and harm reduction programs that are appropriate for women of different ethnic backgrounds.

AB  - The purpose of this project is to explore the services needed by elders who first became homeless in later life. The U.S. Census Bureau projects the elderly homeless population will increase by 33 percent by 2020. Compared with younger counterparts, older homeless people are more isolated and refuse to use traditional services. Findings from surveys, observations and interviews suggest mobile outreach is an efficient strategy to reach out to homeless people. For my design, I focused on creating a mobile service system to help later life older homeless persons to connect to the housing and services and then assisting them back to life. A public bus service system I designed called "Sunshine” provides service connections to later life older homeless people. Even if some of them refuse to use regular services, "Sunshine" will help them to live better lives on the street.

AB  - Although the shipping industry has received considerable attention as a dispersal mechanism for aquatic nuisance species, many invasions have been linked to other mechanisms of transfer. The threat posed to coastal ecosystems by these alternative mechanisms, however, remains largely unquantified. We assessed the potential risks of introducing marine and estuarine species associated with seven mechanisms of transfer: seafood companies, aquaculture operations, bait shops, stores that sell marine ornamental species, research and educational organizations, public aquariums, and coastal restoration projects. For each, we compiled a comprehensive database of organizations in coastal Massachusetts. We then designed and administered a survey to a subset of organizations that inquired about (1) their proximity to saltwater and methods of handling live imports; (2) the type and quantity of marine species being imported; and (3) the organization's familiarity with marine invasions. Respondents in five of the seven categories acknowledged importing nonlocal live marine species to the area. Seafood companies handled the majority of individuals but relatively few taxa. This mechanism of transfer also had the most complex trade patterns and the greatest number of operations located near saltwater. In contrast, the other transfer mechanisms each had simpler trade pathways and fewer operations but varied in the quantity and taxonomic diversity of their imports. Significantly, no single mechanism of transfer stood out as presenting a primary risk. Rather, each had characteristics or used handling practices at different points in the importation process that could facilitate introductions. To prevent future marine invasions, better reporting requirements for live species imports are needed, and best-management practices and outreach strategies specific to the transfer mechanism should be developed and implemented. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Resumen: Aunque la industria de transportación marítima ha recibido considerable atención como un mecanismo de dispersión de especies acuáticas molestas, muchas invasiones han sido relacionadas con otros mecanismos de transferencia. Sin embargo, la amenaza de estos mecanismos alternativos a los ecosistemas costeros permanece en gran parte sin cuantificar. Evaluamos los potenciales riesgos para especies marinas y estuarinas asociados con siete mecanismos de transferencia: compañías de mariscos, operaciones acuaculturales, tiendas de especies marinas ornamentales, organizaciones de investigación y educativas, acuarios públicos y proyectos de restauración costera. Para cada uno, compilamos una amplia base de datos de organizaciones en la costa de Massachusetts. Luego diseñamos y aplicamos una encuesta a un subconjunto de organizaciones para obtener información sobre (1) su proximidad al agua marina y sus métodos para el manejo de importaciones vivas, (2) el tipo y cantidad de especies marinas importadas y (3) la familiaridad de la organización con invasiones marinas. Evaluamos los potenciales riesgos de introducciones de especies marinas y estuarinas. Los encuestados en cinco de siete categorías reconocieron importar especies marinas vivas no locales al área. Las compañías de mariscos manejaron a la mayoría de los individuos pero relativamente pocos taxa. Este mecanismo de transferencia también tuvo los patrones comerciales más complejos y el mayor número de operaciones localizadas cerca de agua marina. En contraste, cada uno de los demás mecanismos de transferencia tuvo canales de comercialización más simples y menos operaciones, pero variaron en la cantidad y diversidad taxonómica de sus importaciones. Significativamente, ningún mecanismo individual resaltó como un riesgo primario. Más bien, cada uno tenía características o utilizaba prácticas de manejo en diferentes etapas del proceso de importación que podían facilitar las introducciones. Para prevenir futuras invasiones marinas, se necesitan mejores requerimientos para reportar la importación de especies vivas, y se deben desarrollar e implementar prácticas de manejo óptimo y estrategias de extensión específicas para el mecanismo de transferencia.

AB  - In my dissertation I examine how particular procedures for realizing insanities and addictions have been insinuated into the routines of organizational practice through which homeless Americans are publicly managed and accounted for. Variously preserving and denying the membership of homeless Americans within our national, state, and local communities (and thereby, preserving or denying their entitlement to the community's collective forbearance and provision for them) is shown to be central to this work. My research draws upon two sources of data. Primary data were collected during four years of ethnographic fieldwork in, and on the periphery of, two publicly funded therapeutic communities established to provide clinical care to homeless adults diagnosed with both severe mental illnesses and concurrent drug or alcohol addictions. I have also thoroughly examined secondary materials bearing on the historical emergence and evolution of the notions that homeless and otherwise dispossessed Americans suffer from insanities, and/or addictions. These secondary materials are used to expand the scope of my analysis and to provide a richer and more sociologically sophisticated account of the political, economic, and cultural reasons my ethnographic research settings were established; the particular manner in which they were established; my own presence as a federally funded social scientist in them; the social forces that induced homeless Americans to participate in these programs; and the ways in which insanities, addictions, and recoveries from these putative disorders were realized in and through the practical activities that were undertaken in and around these settings. In recent years, there has been a rekindling of theoretical interest in the relationships that obtain between personal identity, community membership, and the 'other.' Likewise, the ways in which the social and natural worlds relate to, and mutually influence, one another have become subject to renewed scrutiny by sociologists of science, technology, and clinical work. By examining how the invocation of putative disease agents like insanities and addictions figure in the preservation and denial of community membership, my dissertation illuminates the interface between these two domains at a variety of analytic levels.

AB  - THE RECOMMENDATION FOR A MULTIDISCIPLINARY COMMISSION TO EXPLORE POSSIBILITIES FOR ELIMINATING CRIMINOGENIC INFLUENCES HAS BEEN REITERATED FROM 1965 TO THE PRESENT. NEW PREVENTIVE MEASURES INSTITUTED SINCE THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL INCLUDE A TELEVISION PROGRAM WITH ADVICE ON AVOIDING CRIME-INDUCING SITUATIONS, THE EXPANSION OF WEST GERMAN INTERNAL SECURITY PROJECTS, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A CENTRAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT. THE 104 CRIMINAL POLICE COUNSELING OFFICE PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PREVENTIVE WORK BY PROVIDING UNIFORM COUNSELING POLICIES AND MOBILE ASSISTANCE; A FEDERAL OFFICE FOR TECHNICAL SAFETY DEVICES AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING FOR COUNSELORS ARE NEEDED. PRIVATE INITATIVES SUCH AS THE WHITE RING IN FRANKFURT ASSIST THE POLICE IN PUBLIC RELATIONS WORK AND VICTIM SUPPORT. DESPITE THE NUMEROUS PREVENTITIVE MEASURES, A STRATEGIC GENERAL PREVENTION PLAN IS STILL A NECESSITY TO INITIATE PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND TO COORDINATE THE VARIOUS EFFORTS. THE GERMAN CRIME PREVENTION BOARD WOULD SERVE THIS PURPOSE. THE BOARD WOULD HAVE THE BROADEST POSSIBLE RANGE OF MEMBERS AND WOULD DIRECT RESEARCH INTO CONDITION CONDUCIVE TO CRIME AND EVALUATE PREVENTION EFFORTS. A FULL-TIME EXECUTIVE WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS AND TO MANAGE FINANCES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE BOARD WOULD BE THE INTENSIFICATION OF RESEARCH ON THE ETIOLOGY OF CRIME AND ON EFFECTS OF PREVENTIVE MEASURES AND THE INITIATION OF YOUTH WORK TO PROVIDE LEISURE ACTIVITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND SOCIAL WORK TO FURTHER REINTEGRATION AND REHABILITATION INMATES AND RELEASED PRISONERS. THE BOARD SHOULD ALSO SERVE TO AWAKEN COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND ACTIVE SUPPORT OF THESE GOALS. INTERNATIONAL MODELS CAN BE FOUND IN THE DANISH CRIME PREVENTION COUNCIL, THE SWEDISH PREVENTION COMMITTEE, AND THE BRITISH LOCAL COMMITTEES FOR CRIME PREVENTION. NOTES ARE SUPPLIED. --IN GERMAN.

AB  - Two librarians at Western Oregon State College, a small liberal arts institution serving 4,000 students, rebuilt the library's test collection in 1990 and, in the process, broadened it beyond its traditional education and psychology emphasis into an interdisciplinary collection. At the outset, the project received generous funding and an annual line item slot for test materials was assured. With input from key education faculty members, the librarians reviewed the existing collection, which was largely the result of random donations from faculty. Faculty from the Departments of Education, Psychology, Physical Education, Criminal Justice, Sociology, Business, English as a Second Language, Special Education, Clinical Child and Youth Work, Teaching Research, and Student Development were surveyed and met together to provide input into new test selection. The librarians developed a collection database to facilitate cataloging, test processing procedures, and new test collection and circulation policies and procedures. The timeframe was less than six months. This report provides background information on the college, detailed descriptions of the rebuilding process, and recommendations for maintaining the collection. Appendices include the faculty survey form; the database format used in cataloging tests; and test collection circulation policies, procedures and forms. (Contains 52 references.) (KRN)

AB  - The social dynamics of prostitution render prostitutes unable at times to meet basic human needs, vulnerable to violence, and at risk for sexually transmitted disease. Since April 1989 a mobile van from a private foundation has been contacting prostitutes throughout the five boroughs of New York City to provide HIV testing and counseling and to distribute condoms, bleach kits for cleaning needles, and HIV prevention information. Data collected from 1,963 female prostitutes are discussed in this article. Information is provided on demographics, family and living arrangements, sex and drug practices, HIV status and risk reduction practices, and health history. Methods are discussed for social workers to develop creative ways to provide outreach and develop relationships with a vulnerable population that invests much effort in remaining concealed.

AB  - 1,963 female prostitutes (mean age 29.52 yrs) completed questionnaires covering sex and drug practices, family and living arrangements, and HIV status and risk reduction. 68.3% of Ss smoked crack, but other illicit drugs used by Ss include marijuana, cocaine, iv and nasal heroin. More than half of the Ss used alcohol and more than three-quarters smoked cigarettes. Ss had an extensive history of sexually transmitted diseases (35.2% tested positive for HIV). Condom use was inconsistent. More than half (58.7%) of the Ss lived in their own apartment or house, but many lived in an unstable arrangement and 17.3% indicated they were homeless. Data highlight the vulnerability of the children of prostitutes. Methods are discussed for social workers to develop creative ways to provide outreach and develop relationships with a vulnerable population that invests much effort in remaining concealed.

AB  - Describes one of the first program efforts specifically designed to respond to the special needs of homeless pregnant women, a 3-site service demonstration program established by the Better Homes Fund in collaboration with Ronald McDonald Children's Charities. Homeless pregnant women are at high risk for inadequate prenatal care, pregnancy complications, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. All 3 sites of this program had in common a core set of service components that included emergency shelter, aggressive outreach and case finding, prenatal services, long-term case management, parenting support, and services for special needs (e.g., substance abuse). The problems encountered at these sites are described (e.g., trauma histories, rehousing). Components of a successful program for homeless pregnant women are outlined.

AB  - The guidelines are based on the assumptions that youth are increasingly at risk of a broad range of social and economic problems and that with training, administrative support, and the effective support of the community, public librarians can expand their role in serving this increasingly vulnerable population. An introduction outlines how libraries in the San Francisco Bay Area improved services to at-risk youth during the Bay Area Youth at Risk Project, which operated from 1990-92 with State funding. The project served Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco counties. It involved six types of activities: (1) providing information about services, (2) young adult collection and facility development, (3) special programs for youth, (4) tutoring programs, (5) community outreach, and (6) involving youth in the library through advisory boards and employment. Step-by-step instructions are giving for planning and implementing programs involving some or all of these activities.

AB  - Objective. This article examines the distribution of heavy drug users across health and social service agencies in a community, and ways in which organizational and social policy factors influence pathways to services. Data Sources/Study Setting. Data are from the Community Epidemiology Laboratory, a project that includes comparable surveys of a wide variety of client, service provider, and general population groups in a single northern California county. Study Design. The design is a cross-sectional analysis of patterns of service use and referral by heavy drug users distributed across a variety of service settings and in the general population. Data Collection. In-person, structured interviews by trained interviewers were conducted using comparable instruments, measures, sampling strategies, and fieldwork procedures. Principal Findings. The specialty drug treatment system serves only a small proportion of heavy drug users in the community. Large proportions of drug users are found in criminal justice, primary health, and welfare agencies. Patterns of service encounter and referral suggest that drug treatment clients typically have been in jail or on welfare prior to attending treatment, and are far less likely to have been referred to or from treatment by health providers. Conclusions. Health services research on drug abuse should expand its frame of reference to include services outside the specialty treatment sector. Drug treatment facilities are somewhat remote from other agencies in community service networks and are organizationally dependent on criminal justice and welfare systems. Further research should investigate both the costs and benefits of screening and providing services at earlier points of institutional involvement with drug abusers and the implications of interorganizational dependencies among criminal justice, welfare, and drug agencies for providers and clients.

AB  - In an effort to assist community college development of information technology (IT) training programs and to introduce these programs to disadvantaged students (focusing on young people at risk), the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) and Microsoft Corporation made grant money available through Working Connections, a community computer-training program. In an effort to provide community outreach and improve the quality of life in the areas they serve, police departments were encouraged to join in the partnership efforts. The article describes three police departments and their partnerships with their local community colleges in participating in the Working Connections/IT training program: (1) Monroe Community College and Monroe Police Department in New York; (2) St. Petersburg Junior College and Clearwater Police Department in Florida; and (3) St. Petersburg Junior College and Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. The article concludes with an outline of the process for obtaining IT Readiness Program grant funds.

AB  - This study employed a pretest-posttest design to evaluate the impact of an innovative fieldwork program in Israel that placed BSW students in social change organizations. It examined the program's impact upon students' willingness and sense of self-competence to engage in social action, their willingness to work in social change organizations, their perceptions regarding state responsibility for welfare, and the link between politics and social work. The sample consisted of 141 first-year BSW students from a research and comparison group. The findings show that the intended objectives of the program were not met. Several explanations are offered, as are implications for social work education. Adapted from the source document.

Important similarities between IDU Fs & non-IDU Fs who had an IDU partner emerged, especially high levels of noninjected drug use, crack use, & the trading of sex for crack. Despite considerable knowledge about acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), risky sex & IDU behaviors are the rule. Important principles for outreach & intervention are reported, & the need for simultaneously aggressive & sensitive outreach strategies, & for interventions that take into account the full context of these women's lives, is stressed. 1 Table, 19 References.

AB  - This drug education policy statement for North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University establishes two educational objectives: to develop an educational program that increases the university community's knowledge and competency regarding controlled substances and to increase the skills required to take corrective action for potential drug abusers. In order to achieve those goals, the policy states three program components. The first component is educational and includes plans for an annual drug and alcohol education week, a drug awareness fair, media presentations, campus exhibits, 60-second radio spots on university radio, publication of a drug prevention brochure, and continuous monthly outreach programs in each residence hall. The second section describes the rehabilitation component of the program including the University Counseling Center, the Student Health Center, and connections to community health services. The section on the third program component, sanctions, covers the individual's responsibility to know the law regarding drug use, the university's procedural guidelines in the event of a violation and the sanctions for those who violate drug use policy. Listed first are sanctions for trafficking in illegal drugs, and second illegal possession of drugs. A section following discusses suspension pending final disposition procedures. The conclusion reiterates the university's commitment to education as a primary tool for combating drug abuse. (JB)

AB  - The link between women in poverty and higher education is important because it reflects inequities in access and resources that exist in the Mid-Atlantic Appalachian region. Two main questions guided the research of women in poverty in regard to postsecondary access and attainment. First, what are the experiences of Mid-Atlantic Appalachian-born women as students in postsecondary institutions? Second, how do the experiences of Mid-Atlantic Appalachian women help provide a better understanding pertaining to college/university practices that would enable these women to engage in institutions of higher learning and become successful? In order to understand the experiences of economically poor women's higher education opportunities, a qualitative approach was implemented. After performing semi-structured interviews, themes captured the landscape of oppression, human capital levels, and identity formation for Mid-Atlantic Appalachian women in order to examine how they were able to be successful with degree attainment. Main themes were found regarding the Appalachian culture for women, identity development of the participants, and elements of access and success during their college experience. Implications that were found as a result of this study included (a) the student culture impact on services at colleges/universities, (b) the importance of colleges to provide an ethic of care, (c) the need for better post-secondary outreach and resources for Appalachian communities and (d) exposure of the oppressive social structures that still exist for this population of women. Recommendations were made regarding higher education practices and future research in the areas of poverty and the generational cycles of women in Appalachia.

AB  - Objective: To map sexual health promotion activity and resources across North West England. Study design: Survey. Methods: A survey of all sexual health promotion activity commissioned by primary care trusts (PCTs) was carried out using a self-completion questionnaire for PCT sexual health commissioners in North West England. Results: Sixteen out of 24 PCTs responded. Some PCTs had difficulty in identifying the relevant commissioner. Most activity was focused on young people, especially around the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) and teenage pregnancy, and on particular high-risk groups such as lesbian, gay and bisexual people, those living with human immunodeficiency virus and commercial sex workers. All PCTs commissioned education/training and a condom distribution service. Other common activities included outreach work, and producing and disseminating materials. Most services were confined to one PCT. Most PCTs were unable to identify the resources committed to sexual health promotion. The emergent themes in the analysis of service development ideas and comments were all linked to commissioning: commissioning and strategy; funding; needs assessment; service development and provision; contracting and monitoring; evaluation and evidence; and regional perspective. Conclusions: A simple tool to map sexual health promotion activities commissioned by PCTs was developed. Many PCTs could not identify a commissioner for sexual health or the resources committed to sexual health promotion. Sexual health promotion activity focused on young people (linked to the NCSP and teenage pregnancy) and particular high-risk groups, with resultant gaps and a mismatch with the epidemiology. The most frequently commissioned activities were education/training and condom provision (despite the limited evidence base). A series of recommendations to PCTs, sexual health networks and providers are made. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic escalates, the need for primary prevention programs to disseminate information has become more important than ever. This research is an analysis of all calls received by an AIDS hotline in central Massachusetts over an 8-month period. Of the 387 calls received, 55% were from males. The majority of callers were in their 20s (42%) or 30s (22%), with 5% of calls coming from adolescents. Among risk behaviors, 9% of callers identified themselves as homosexual men, 3% identified themselves as bisexual men, and 7% identified themselves as intravenous drug users. Forty-five percent called to ask questions about what constituted high-risk behavior. Only 2% of callers were already diagnosed as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected. Forty-three percent of callers wanted information about HIV testing, while only 17% were interested in safer sex information. Adolescents tended to be more interested in obtaining safer sex information. A highly significant gender difference in presenting problems was noted. Men called primarily because they were concerned about their own health and possibility of infection, while women called primarily because they were concerned about family members, partners, or friends. These hotline data point out the need for further education and community outreach. (NB)

AB  - The so-called 'Youth Problem' is interpreted as an adult creation reflecting the instability and inadequacy of present-day society. Citing the prevalence of juvenile delinquency, the need for a broad, preventive program of strengthened community services to provide for the needs of youth is recognized. Many agencies, federal, state, and private provide youth services. Typical instances of community organizations dedicated to meeting the basic needs of youth are presented. Special emphasis is placed upon the contributions of organized women's groups to youth work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Previous studies have found that even limited prevention-related interventions can affect health behaviors such as substance use and risky sex. Substance abuse treatment providers are ideal candidates to provide these services, but typically have little or no financial incentive to do so. The purpose of this study was therefore to explore why some substance abuse treatment units have added new prevention and outreach services. Based on an ecological framework of organizational strategy, three categories of predictors were tested: (1) environmental, (2) unit-level, and (3) unit leadership. Results: A lagged cross-sectional logistic model of 450 outpatient substance abuse treatment units revealed that local per capita income, mental health center affiliation, and clinical supervisors' graduate degrees were positively associated with likelihood of adding prevention-related education and outreach services. Managed care contracts and methadone treatment were negatively associated with addition of these services. No hospital-affiliated agencies added prevention and outreach services during the study period. Conclusion: Findings supported the study's ecological perspective on organizational strategy, with factors at environmental, unit, and unit leadership levels associated with additions of prevention and outreach services. Among the significant predictors, ties to managed care payers and unit leadership graduate education emerge as potential leverage points for public policy. In the current sample, units with managed care contracts were less likely to add prevention and outreach services. This is not surprising, given managed care's emphasis on cost control. However, the association with this payment source suggests that public managed care programs might affects prevention and outreach differently through revised incentives. Specifically, government payers could explicitly compensate substance abuse treatment units in managed care contracts for prevention and outreach. The effects of supervisor graduate education on likelihood of adding new prevention and outreach programs suggests that leaders' education can affect organizational strategy. Foundation and government officials may encourage prevention and outreach by funding curricular enhancements to graduate degree programs demonstrating the importance of public goods. Overall, these findings suggest that both money and professional education affect substance abuse treatment unit additions of prevention and outreach services, as well as other factors less amenable to policy intervention.

AB  - Purpose: Psychiatric conditions require aggressive management that is challenging to provide in free clinics. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of certain mental illnesses and comorbid conditions among the patients of a student-managed free clinic for the homeless. Method: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis of the records of patients who visited the student-run Houston Outreach Medicine, Education, and Social Services (HOMES) Clinic from May 2007 through May 2008. They assessed the prevalence of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia among patients. They compared demographics, health insurance status, comorbid medical conditions, and social habit data of patients with these mental illnesses with those of other clinic patients. Results: Of 286 patients (74.5% male, mean age 45.8 years), 25 (8.7%) had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 45 (15.7%) had bipolar disorder. Compared with other clinic patients, patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia were less likely to be male (P < .0001) and were more likely to have publicly funded insurance (P = .024). They were also more likely to have certain comorbid conditions, including asthma (P = .0004), seizures (P = .0007), kidney disease (P = .01), and heart disease (P = .02). Conclusions: The high prevalence of these mental illnesses combined with the increased burden of medical comorbidity among HOMES Clinic patients has implications for student-managed free clinics, which often operate on limited budgets. Strategies for providing care for these patients in this setting include integrated care, street medicine, and case management. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Street outreach is considered a key HIV prevention strategy in the United States. To determine whether street outreach to prevent HIV infection as practised by state-funded community-based organizations (CBOs) is effective in promoting condom use, we conducted an evaluation using a quasi-experimental design. Twenty-one CBOs involved in street outreach conducted cross-sectional surveys assessing risk behaviour and exposure to outreach activities in 66 intervention and 13 comparison areas in Louisiana over a 2-year period. Surveys were collected from 4950 persons at intervention sites and 1597 persons at comparison sites. After controlling for demographic characteristics and sexual risk factors, persons in intervention sites were more likely to use condoms than persons in comparison sites [odds ratio 1.37 (95% confidence interval 1.20, 1.56; P<0.001)]. Contact with an outreach worker mediated condom use. The mechanism of effect may be related to direct contact with an outreach worker and condom distribution rather than to broader community mobilization.

AB  - Use of methamphetamine, a potent central nervous system stimulant, increased in the early to mid-1990s in the US, concentrated in the West, Midwest, & South. The use & trade of methamphetamine was facilitated by a fairly simple production process & the involvement of numerous small entrepreneurs as well as drug-trafficking syndicates. National data from the 1994 Drug Abuse Warning network revealed that for the period from 1991 to 1994 methamphetamine use among short-stay hospital patients more than tripled, & methamphetamine-related deaths reported by medical examiner offices nearly tripled. In addition, the Treatment Episode Data Set revealed a 43% increase in treatment program admissions in which clients identified methamphetamine as the primary drug of abuse. Nonetheless, methamphetamine use did not become widespread in the US population. Low-income & unemployed young white men continue to be the group most likely to use methamphetamine, but by the mid-1990s the drug had increased in popularity in more diverse populations & regions. Economic & social pressures experienced by a broad array of Americans may partially explain expanded methamphetamine use; eg, depressed economic conditions in rural & semirural areas have contributed to methamphetamine's appeal as a source of income. A "war against drugs" approach as characterized the policy response, with increased criminal justice penalties. A public health approach is recommended, including prevention campaigns, harm-reduction outreach & treatment approaches, & pharmacologic & abstinence-based drug treatment approaches. 23 References.

AB  - This ethnography is an account of six Latina youth participating in an all-girls after-school program in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City. The program, Girls Now, was designed to "help adolescent girls overcome the barriers of urban life and poverty" by providing them with a safe space and educational workshops. One component of the program integrated online digital badge software, Play Now, to implement curriculum and enhance learning. I conducted fieldwork from September 2011 – June 2013 in varying capacities linked directly to the after-school program and the digital badge game. In this ethnography I address the behavior change goals of the game (and broader nonprofit program) and compare them with the real-world realities of the game functionality. Through interactional analysis (IA) of how the girls used the software, including conversations, actions, produced artifacts, and improvised playful practices, I create a clearer understanding of how they shared information, navigated their social worlds, maintained friendships, and educated themselves and each other, in creative and unexpected ways.

AB  - Project ARRIVE (AIDS Risk Reduction for IV Drug Users on Parole) was funded between September 1987 and December 1990. The ARRIVE model incorporated principles and techniques useful with substance-abusing populations in other settings. A social-learning approach to prevention training emphasized learning skills to help parolees resist relapse to drug use. A self-help orientation encouraged participants to accept responsibility for their own behavior and recognize their potential to change their behavior and environment. The ARRIVE model also applied principles that have been successfully used in therapeutic community programs. ARRIVE offered participants job preparation and placement assistance for entry-level employment in the AIDS education/outreach field. Program elements were combined into a structured eight-week, 24-session AIDS prevention program. A total of 394 persons were recruited from New York State prisons, community agencies, and self-referral. To assess program outcomes, the evaluation conducted follow-up interviews with program graduates and all eligible parolees who did not participate in ARRIVE. The interviews, which were conducted 1 year after program completion, focused on changes in AIDS knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about risk reduction, AIDS risk behaviors, and social adjustment. A total of 394 eligible parolees (81 percent male, 19 percent female) were recruited, of whom 241 attended the program; 164 completed the program. The evaluation showed that ARRIVE participation significantly decreased certain sexual and drug-related risk behaviors and improved parolees' community adjustment. 10 tables and 39 references

AB  - This invited article is one of several comprising part of a special issue of Child Abuse and Neglect focused on child trafficking and health. The purpose of each invited article is to describe a specific program serving children who are survivors of trafficking (a subset of commercial sexual exploitation-CSE). These programs are featured to raise awareness of innovative counter-trafficking strategies emerging worldwide and facilitate collaboration on program development and outcomes research. This article describes Resiliency Interventions for Sexual Exploitation (RISE), a US-based multidisciplinary program dedicated to assisting female, LGBT and gender non-conforming (GNC) youth victims and survivors of commercial sexual exploitation (CSE) and child trafficking to develop the skills and resources for successful community reintegration. This is accomplished through daily collaborations with community partners (MDT-Multidisciplinary Treatment Teams), gender-specific trauma-focused services, comprehensive outreach and engagement efforts and intensive case management.

AB  - The "Wyman Teen Outreach Program" (TOP) is a life skills curriculum for 12- to 17-year-olds that aims to prevent negative youth behaviors, such as school failure and early pregnancy. Trained facilitators deliver the curriculum in weekly classes throughout the school year. Participants discuss topics such as goal-setting, peer pressure, relationship dynamics, values, and communication skills. The program can be integrated with a school's existing curriculum, offered as an in-school elective, or an after-school program. The What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) identified 9 studies of TOP that were published or released between 1988 and 2008. Seven studies are within the scope of the review and have an eligible design, but do not meet WWC evidence standards, and two studies are out of the scope of the review, as defined by the Dropout Prevention protocol, because they do not present primary research. The lack of studies meeting WWC evidence standards means that, at this time, the WWC is unable to draw any conclusions based on research about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of TOP.

AB  - Background: Despite decades of HIV responses in pockets of West and Central Africa (WCA), the HIV response with key populations remains an understudied area. Recently, there has been a proliferation of studies highlighting epidemiologic and behavioral data that challenge attitudes of complacency among donors and country governments uncomfortable in addressing key populations. Methods: The articles in this series highlight new studies that provide a better understanding of the epidemiologic and structural burden facing key populations in the WCA region and how to improve responses through more effective targeting. Results: Key populations face pervasive structural barriers including institutional and sexual violence and an intersection of stigma, criminalization, and marginalization as sexual minorities. Despite decades of smaller interventions that have shown the importance of integrated services for key populations, there remains incongruent provision of outreach or testing or family planning pointing to sustained risk. There remains an incongruent resource provision for key populations where they shoulder the burden of HIV and their access to services alone could turn around HIV epidemics within the region. Conclusions: These proximal and distal determinants must be addressed in regional efforts, led by the community, and resourced for scale, targeting those most at risk for the acquisition and transmission of HIV. This special issue builds the knowledge base for the region focusing on interventions that remove barriers to service access including treatment uptake for those living with HIV. Better analysis and use of data for strategic planning are shown to lead to more effective targeting of prevention, care, and HIV treatment programs with key populations. These articles further demonstrate the immediate need for comprehensive action to address HIV among key populations throughout the WCA region.

AB  - This article reports findings from the initial phase of an ongoing study of runaway and homeless adolescents in four Midwestern states. One hundred eight homeless and runaway adolescents were interviewed directly on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth services agencies. Levels of physical and sexual abuse within family of origin, participation in deviant subsistence strategies, and levels of victimization while on the streets are reported. Path analysis indicated that abusive family backgrounds had a positive direct effect on victimization of adolescents on the streets, and indirectly increased the likelihood of victimization by increasing the amount of time at risk, deviant peer associations, and risky behaviors.

AB  - Both of these Exemplary Projects are located in hospitals; both provide medical care, crisis intervention, and counseling for victims and their families; both have found ways to make the legal system less threatening to the child victim; and both are committed to improving the community's response to child victims through specialized training and public-awareness activities. In Washington, D.C., the number of victims referred to the project increased nearly 30 percent in the project's 3 years of operation. The project developed a model curriculum for training criminal justice, social service, health care, and mental health personnel; innovated the use of diagnosed gonorrhea as a possible indicator of abuse; designed a Medical-Legal Sexual Assault Evidence Form adopted by the D.C. police for all sexual assault cases; and devised a system for tracking cases through the criminal and juvenile justice systems. The Seattle project succeeded in forming a cohesive network among key agencies involved in treating and prosecuting child sexual abuse cases; instituted new investigative procedures that meet child victims' special needs; and aided in doubling the number of cases filed and disposed of in the King County courts. The manual traces the projects' histories; explains the projects' funding; describes organizational structure and staff composition; and details clinical services, coordination with other agencies, and community outreach activities. A final chapter discusses replication issues, including the legal environment, program affiliation, interagency coordination, professional training, and funding sources. Figures, tables, notes, and appended project materials are provided.

AB  - Assessed the impact of a campus outreach program aimed at heightening awareness of and capacity to respond to life-threatening crisis in 3 groups of undergraduates. In addition, a series of radio announcements were made on an hourly basis on a local station. Group 1 consisted of 35 transfer students and 17 international students who participated in a 4-session mass-instruction program. Group 2 consisted of 14 Ss involved in a small-group, 4-session training program. Group 3 consisted of 24 Ss who completed pre- and posttests, as did other Ss, but received no treatment in the interim. All Ss were in high-risk subpopulations for suicide. ANOVA showed significant posttest improvement for Groups 1 and 2. In addition, new clients at the mental health center cited the effect of the radio announcements on their presentation for intake and the total number of new clients increased significantly. The 30-item test instrument is included. (3 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study (1) presents a comprehensive analysis of the sexual behavior of young Black women, (2) determines how AIDS affects their decision-making, and (3) considers how health and sex education programs might effectively address the needs and concerns of young Black females. My contention is that Black teenagers' sexual decision-making and behavior take place in a context where the formation of sexual identities, the meaning and value of motherhood and pregnancy, and the material conditions of life are especially important considerations. I illustrate that these three factors shape how Black adolescent girls respond to the threat of HIV infection by examining how these elements influence sexual behavior and reproductive decision-making. I also explore the meanings of these social formations in the lives of these women. A fundamental assumption in this study is that a combination of structural, social, and individual characteristics determine whether Black teenagers engage in risky sexual behaviors. Structural inequality, risk-taking, self-efficacy, and perceived future life chances are all factors that influence attitudes and behaviors associated with sexuality and childbearing. This study was conducted in New Haven, Connecticut. The primary data collection method was a two-year field study. There were forty-one teenaged participants in the in-depth project, aged thirteen to nineteen. Seventy percent were Black, and the remaining thirty percent Latina and white. A snowball selection process was used to generate the sample. Professionals specializing in youth issues and sex/AIDS outreach provided additional information. The Centers for Disease Control and the Connecticut Department of Health supplied secondary data on AIDS, contraceptive use, as well as pregnancy and childbirth rates. The findings indicate that most participants had a general understanding of reproductive processes and of AIDS. Teenagers are more likely to engage in unprotected sex or have multiple sexual partners when their perceived future life options are limited. Poverty and educational status are as likely to be associated with early and risky sex as race or ethnicity. Sex education programs effectively reduce risky behavior when opportunity structures and perceived life options are addressed through life-skills training.

AB  - This evaluation reviews efforts made by Illinois Action for Children (IAFC), with guidance from the Illinois Governor's Office for Early Childhood Development, to spur experimentation with new systemic change strategies to increase the number of children from priority populations--those considered to be the most vulnerable, with multiple risk factors--who are enrolled in high quality early learning programs. The Early Childhood Innovation Zones initiative, funded by a Race to the Top--Early Learning Challenge grant, supported capacity building efforts for organizations working with young children in 11 underserved communities, or Innovation Zones (IZs), across Illinois. The theory of action undergirding the IZ project calls for building capacity in these organizations to promote the implementation of system improvement strategies for increasing two primary outcome measures: (1) enrolling and serving more children (birth to kindergarten) from priority populations in early learning programs; and (2) increasing the number of early learning programs participating in ExceleRate Illinois, the state's quality rating and improvement system (QRIS). Illinois Action for Children's capacity-building efforts combined behavioral change theories with systemic thinking and community engagement strategies. These efforts were designed to help zones conceptualize concerns at the system level and to equip zone leaders with the skills and community partnerships needed to address these concerns. This study used a mixed methods approach to describe the strategies utilized by the IZs to improve enrollment and quality and evaluate the progress of capacity building efforts made by IAFC. The study is summarized in this report. [For the full report, "Illinois' Early Childhood Innovation Zones: A New Model for State Policy? IERC 2017-1," see ED574338.

AB  - CeaseFire is a public health program that reduced gun violence in several Chicago neighborhoods. Two types of outreach are central to the model: (1) the mediation of street conflicts and (2) the engagement, mentoring, and case-management of high-risk youth to help them make positive changes in their lives. An increasing number of communities are adopting CeaseFire or similar models, but little research has examined the specific activities of street outreach and the process of implementing it. A two-part study was conducted; the formative phase involved analysis of conflict mediation records from the CeaseFire replication in Baltimore, and the primary research phase was a multiple-case study of the Ceasefire model in Chicago and Baltimore. Qualitative data were collected through focus groups and interviews with program staff and review of program documents. The staff practices, management techniques, and features of the local context perceived to support effective street outreach were identified. Outreach and implementation activities were similar in the two cities. Outreach staff must have street credibility, be respectful of youth and community members, and be patient. Most outreach workers were ex-offenders; the inclusion of law enforcement and community members in the hiring process helps ensure that applicants are no longer involved in crime. In Baltimore, where conflict mediation and case-management duties were combined in one position, managers believe that separation of these roles would be preferable. Conflict mediation is complex and frequently involves gang members and weapons; outreach staff help potential shooters consider the consequences of their actions rather than reacting instinctively with violence. Assisting youth in obtaining employment was viewed as a key to reducing their risk of involvement in violence. Shooting reductions may be easier to attain in more isolated communities where less violence comes from passers-through. Ceasefire sites may benefit from considering the extent to which the recommendations derived through this study apply in their setting. If perceived effectiveness is correlated with true effectiveness, the use of the tactics described here may help this promising model achieve its full life-saving potential.

AB  - Background: Mediation of potentially violent conflicts is a key component of CeaseFire, an effective gun violence-prevention programme. Objective: To describe conflicts mediated by outreach workers (OW) in Baltimore’s CeaseFire replication, examine neighbourhood variation, and measure associations between conflict risk factors and successful nonviolent resolution. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using records for 158 conflicts mediated between 2007 and 2009. Involvement of youth, gangs, retaliation, weapons and other risk factors were described. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used for data-reduction purposes before the relationship between conflict risk components and mediation success was assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Results: Most conflicts involved 2–3 individuals. Youth, persons with a history of violence, gang members and weapons were commonly present. OWs reported immediate, nonviolent resolution for 65% of mediated conflicts; an additional 23% were at least temporarily resolved without violence. PCA identified four dimensions of conflict risk: the risk-level of individuals involved; whether the incident was related to retaliation; the number of people involved; and shooting likelihood. However, these factors were not related to the OW’s ability to resolve the conflict. Neighbourhoods with programme-associated reductions in homicides mediated more gang-related conflicts; neighbourhoods without programme-related homicide reductions encountered more retaliatory conflicts and more weapons.

AB  - Black males and females are consistently underrepresented in gifted programs. Just as unfortunate, countless reports and studies indicate that too many Black males are not succeeding in school settings. A scholar identity model, grounded in various achievement-based theories, is shared in this article as one solution to addressing the educational and social plight of Black male adolescents. In addition to presenting the model, suggestions for prevention and intervention are provided. (Contains 1 figure and 1 endnote.)

AB  - Objective: The aim of this program was to (1) increase awareness of individual cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in underserved communities, (2) educate participants about lifestyle modifications to reduce CVD risk, and (3) link individuals at moderate to high risk with healthcare. Community health workers (CHWs) delivered the program in 14 urban, rural and frontier Colorado communities. Method: We analyzed data from CVD screenings of 17,995 individuals throughout Colorado between 2006 and 2009 in order to understand the reach and impact of the program on reaching target populations, identifying at-risk individuals and improving awareness of CVD risk. Results: In 3 years, 15 CHWs screened 17,995 clients for CVD risk, of which, almost 60% were racial and ethnic minorities and 42% were uninsured. Twenty-nine percent of participants had medium or high Framingham Risk Scores. Over three-quarters were overweight or obese, over one-fifth had mildly to severely high blood pressure, and 42% had borderline high or high cholesterol. Significantly, 82% had no knowledge of their CVD risk prior to screening. Conclusion: This program is a replicable model for reaching minority and medically underserved populations who are at risk for CVD in urban, rural and frontier communities.

AB  - Introduction and Aims. Homelessness status is strongly correlated with higher rates of substance use. Few studies, however, examine the complex relationship between housing status and substance use in people who inject drugs (PWID).This study extends previous research by comparing the physical and mental health status and service utilisation rates between stably housed and homeless PWID. Design and Methods. A cross-sectional sample of 923 PWID were recruited for the 2012 Illicit Drug Reporting System. Multivariate models were generated addressing associations between homelessness and the domains of demographics; substance use; and health status, service utilisation and criminal justice system contact, with significant correlates entered into a final multivariate model. Results. Two-thirds of the PWID sample were male. The median age was 39 years and 16% identified as Indigenous. Almost one-quarter (23%) reported that they were homeless. Homeless PWID were significantly more likely to be unemployed [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26, 6.34], inject in public (AOR 2.01, 95% CI 1.38, 3.18), have poorer mental health (AOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97, 1.00), report schizophrenia (AOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.16, 4.60) and have a prison history (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.05, 2.21) than stably housed PWID. Discussion and Conclusions. Findings highlight the challenge of mental health problems for homeless PWID. Our results demonstrate that further research that evaluates outcomes of housing programs accommodating PWID, particularly those with comorbid mental health disorders, is warranted. Results also emphasise the need to better utilise integrated models of outreach care that co-manage housing and mental health needs.

AB  - International criminal tribunals (such as the ICTY and ICTR, and more recently the hybrid courts for Sierra Leone and East Timor) have been heralded as a significant step forward in the battle against impunity for human rights violations. However, there has been an almost complete vacuum of research among the local populations who are the supposed beneficiaries of international criminal justice. Self-congratulatory reports by the tribunals sharply contrast with the realities of their operating environment: a closeting off of international criminal tribunals from the local society around them, mistreatment of victims and survivors by defence lawyers and others, racism within tribunal structures and political manipulation of the legal process. An institutional mentality is revealed which is more concerned with protecting its own existence than meeting the needs of a population devastated by conflict: an edifice which is more "Emperor's new clothes" than new horizons in justice. These findings also point towards a broader problem within international legal structures which could be accurately characterised as an absence of 'legal humility'. In light of this failing, and the deeper failing of institutions of international criminal justice to either engage with or respond to the demands of local populations, we pose the fundamental question: who is international criminal justice for? Themes explored include law as seduction, the triumph of human rights, the sociology of arrogance in international law and the tendency to 'see' international justice like a state. The paper is based on fieldwork with grassroots NGOs and individuals in Rwanda and Sierra Leone, and offers a corrective to the rose-tinted tone of much commentary on the respective tribunals for those nations. It is part of a larger project which has involved similar fieldwork in Northern Ireland, Colombia, South Africa and Idonesia. The research will be published as a book by Cambridge University Press in 2008. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Law & Society is the property of Law & Society Association and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was enacted in 1997 to provide health insurance coverage to uninsured low-income children from families who earned too much to be eligible for Medicaid. OBJECTIVES: To develop a 'baseline' portrait of SCHIP enrollees in 5 states (Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Indiana, and New York) by examining: 1) SCHIP enrollees' demographic characteristics and health care experiences before enrolling in SCHIP, particularly children with special health care needs (CSHCN), racial and ethnic minority children, and adolescents; 2) the quality of the care adolescents received before enrollment; and 3) the changes in enrollee characteristics as programs evolve and mature. METHODS: Each of 5 projects from the Child Health Insurance Research Initiative (CHIRI) surveyed new SCHIP enrollees as identified by state enrollment data. CHIRI investigators developed the CHIRI common core (a set of survey items from validated instruments), which were largely incorporated into each survey. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to ascertain whether there were racial and ethnic disparities in access to health care and differences between CSHCN and those without. Current Population Survey data for New York State were used to identify secular trends in enrollee characteristics. RESULTS: Most SCHIP enrollees (65% in Florida to 79% in New York) resided in families with incomes < or =150% of the federal poverty level. Almost half of SCHIP enrollees lived in single-parent households. A majority of SCHIP parents had not had education beyond high school, and in 2 states (Alabama and New York) approximately 25% had not completed high school. The vast majority of children lived in households with a working adult, and in a substantial proportion of households both parents worked. Children tended to be either insured for the entire 12 months or uninsured the entire 12 months before enrolling in SCHIP. Private insurance was the predominant form of insurance before enrollment in SCHIP in most states, but 23.3% to 51.2% of insured children had Medicaid as their most recent insurance. HEALTH CARE USE AND UNMET NEEDS BEFORE SCHIP: The vast majority of all SCHIP enrollees had a usual source of care (USC) during the year before SCHIP. The proportion of children who changed their USC after enrolling in SCHIP ranged from 29% to 41.3%. A large proportion of SCHIP enrollees used health services during the year before SCHIP, with some variability across states in the use of health care. Nevertheless, 32% to almost 50% of children reported unmet needs. CSHCN: The prevalence of CSHCN in SCHIP (between 17% and 25%) in the study states was higher than the prevalence of CSHCN reported in the general population in those states. In many respects, CSHCN were similar to children without special health care needs, but CSHCN had poorer health status, were more likely to have had unmet needs, and were more likely to use the emergency department, mental health care, specialty care, and acute care in the year before enrolling in SCHIP than children without special health care needs. RACE AND ETHNICITY: A substantial proportion of SCHIP enrollees were black non-Hispanic or Hispanic children (Alabama: 34% and <1%; Florida: 6% and 26%; Kansas: 12% and 15%; and New York: 31% and 45%, respectively). Minority children were poorer, in poorer health, and less likely to have had a USC or private insurance before enrolling in SCHIP. The prevalence and magnitude of the disparities varied among the states. QUALITY OF CARE FOR ADOLESCENTS: Seventy-three percent of adolescent SCHIP enrollees engaged in one or more risk behaviors (ie, feeling sad or blue; alcohol, tobacco, and drug use; having sexual intercourse; and not wearing seat belts). Although almost 70% of adolescents reported having had a preventive care visit the previous year, a majority of them did not receive counseling in each of 4 counseling areas. Controlling for other factors, having a private, confidential visit with the physician was associated with an increased liked likelihood (2-3 times more likely) that the adolescent received counseling for 3 of 4 counseling areas. TRENDS OVER TIME: New York SCHIP enrollees in 2001, compared with 1994 enrollees in New York's SCHIP-precursor child health insurance program, were more likely to be black or Hispanic, older, from New York City, and from families with lower education, income, and employment levels. A greater proportion of 2001 enrollees was uninsured for some time in the year before enrollment, was insured by Medicaid, and lacked a USC. Secular trends in the low-income population in the state did not seem to be responsible for these differences. Program modifications during this time period that may be related to the shift in enrollee characteristics include changes to benefits, outreach and marketing efforts, changes in the premium structure, and the advent of a single application form for multiple public programs. CONCLUSIONS: SCHIP enrollees are a diverse group, and there was considerable variation among the 5 study states. Overall, SCHIP enrollees had substantial and wide-ranging health care needs despite high levels of prior contact with the health care system. A sizable minority of SCHIP enrollees has special health care needs. There is racial and ethnic diversity in the composition of enrollees as well, with racial and ethnic disparities present. The quality of care adolescents received before enrollment in SCHIP was suboptimal, with many reporting unmet health care needs and not receiving recommended counseling. The characteristics of SCHIP enrollees can be expected to change as SCHIP programs evolve and mature. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: 1) Benefits should be structured to meet the needs of SCHIP enrollees, which are comparable to Medicaid enrollees' needs in many respects. 2) Provider networks will have to be broad if continuity of care is to be achieved. 3) Multiple outreach strategies should be used, including using providers to distribute information about SCHIP. 4) The quality of care delivered to vulnerable populations (eg, minority children, CSHCN, and adolescents) should be monitored. 5) States and health plans should actively promote quality health care with the goal of improving the care received by SCHIP enrollees before enrollment. 6) States will have to craft policies that fit their local context. 7) Collecting baseline information on SCHIP enrollees on a continuous basis is important, because enrollee characteristics and needs can change, and many vulnerable children are enrolling in SCHIP.

AB  - Results of three community projects developed to reduce and prevent juvenile delinquency and provide parent support in a high-risk neighborhood are presented. The Parent Empowerment Project (PEP), Parent Education (PE), and Transition to 7th Grade Program were designed to provide family-based and school-based services in a primarily Hispanic neighborhood. All programs have a grassroots focus and emphasize development of long-term community strength and support. Since 1998, over 100 families have received in-home therapy, 200 parents have received parent education training, and 70 children have received ongoing individual mentoring and small-group study/social skills assistance. Preliminary analyses indicate significant improvements for children and their families as a result of their involvement in these programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effectiveness of registry-driven, community-based outreach directed toward children with immunization delays. METHODS: A sample of 1,856 children aged 6 to 10 months was randomly assigned to receive either outreach or no intervention. RESULTS: Children in the outreach group were more likely to receive an immunization during the observation period than children in the control group (61% vs 43%). Outreach was most effective for children with multiple risks, as measured by their immunization record; it was not effective for children whose mothers had received inadequate prenatal care. CONCLUSIONS: Registry-driven outreach can effectively identify high-risk children and bring them to care.

They are explored in a qualitative study of 10 gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth who either currently participate or have previously participated in the program. Participants were interviewed in person by means of an open-ended questionnaire to describe, in their own words, existing or perceived barriers to accessing this program. Content analysis revealed several barriers. These identified barriers included: outreach strategies, age range of participants, confidentiality, site location, group format and 'at-risk' youth. The researcher offers seven program planning recommendations based on the participants' experiences and the existing literature.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>This article extends the risk environment framework to understand the factors that universities identify as influencing university students' risky drinking behaviours and universities attempts at managing risky alcohol use on their campuses.<bold>Methods: </bold>This article examines data collected as part of qualitative fieldwork on university corporate security services, and others involved in university alcohol policy implementation (e.g., residence services), conducted at five Canadian universities. Interviews (n=56), fieldnotes from 246h of observations of university corporate security personnel, and university policy documents (i.e., codes of student behaviour, residence policies) were analysed to understand the influence of risk environments on high-risk alcohol use.<bold>Results: </bold>We identify three risk environments on university campuses in relation to the use and regulation of alcohol: the physical, social, and policy environments. Residence buildings and abutting spaces (physical risk environment) and the university "party" culture (social risk environment) are principal contributors to risk within their risk environments. University policies and practices (policy risk environment) attempt to modify these environments in order to manage risky alcohol use.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>We suggest current approaches to regulating student alcohol use may not be the best approach to preventing harms (e.g., health problems, legal troubles) to students. Given university policies and practices have the potential to shape and influence risky alcohol use and associated harms we argue it is necessary for university administrators to adopt the best practices of "harm reduction" and seek new ways to address on-campus alcohol use.

AB  - This study reports on the implementation of Gateway to College, a program whose mission is to serve students who have dropped out of high school, or who are at risk of dropping out of high school, by allowing them to earn a high school diploma and credits toward a postsecondary degree. Gateway to College is uniquely ambitious in providing struggling students with opportunities often reserved for the highest achievers; it believes that high expectations and the right support can lead to more students completing high school and transitioning to college. This report has two main goals: (1) Provide an in-depth description of the Gateway to College model, and more precisely define the youth population served by the program; and (2) Describe the implementation of the Gateway to College model at three program sites, assess the extent to which it is implemented as designed at those sites, and draw lessons for other Gateway to College programs. This study finds that, at a broad level, the three study sites implemented the Gateway to College model as designed. However, Gateway to College struggled with finding the right balance between being flexible and providing concrete guidelines for implementation. The following are appended: (1) Lessons Learned About Student Outreach; and (2) Data-Collection Activities.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an integrated, multi-component, school-based intervention programme on cardiovascular disease ( CVD) risk factors among a multi-ethnic cohort of middle school students. Methods HEALTHY was a cluster randomized, controlled, primary prevention trial. Middle school was the unit of randomization and intervention. Half of the schools were assigned to an intervention programme consisting of changes in the total school food environment and physical education classes, enhanced by educational outreach and behaviour change activities and promoted by a social marketing campaign consisting of reinforcing messages and images. Outcome data reported (anthropometrics, blood pressure and fasting lipid levels) were collected on a cohort of students enrolled at the start of 6th grade (∼11-12 years old) and followed to end of 8th grade (∼13-14 years old). Results Forty-two middle schools were enrolled at seven field centres; 4363 students provided both informed consent and CVD data at baseline and end of study. The sample was 52.7% female, 54.5% Hispanic, 17.6% non- Hispanic Black, 19.4% non- Hispanic White and 8.5% other racial/ethnic combinations, and 49.6% were categorized as overweight or obese (body mass index ≥ 85th percentile) at baseline. A significant intervention effect was detected in the prevalence of hypertension in non-Hispanic Black and White males. The intervention produced no significant changes in lipid levels. Conclusions The prevalence of some CVD risk factors is high in minority middle school youth, particularly males. A multi-component, school-based programme achieved only modest reductions in these risk factors; however, promising findings occurred in non- Hispanic Black and White males with hypertension.

AB  - In 1987, 27 percent of adolescents at a New York City shelter for runaways tested positive for AIDS antibodies. Teaching youth about AIDS is difficult; reaching street kids with AIDS prevention messages is even more problematical. Outreach and shelter workers agree that the 'just say no' approach is ineffective with street kids. They have given out condoms and flyers on AIDS risk reduction. They emphasize the importance of using adolescents' own language. The Streetwork Project, an outreach program in New York City uses food to make casual contacts with street kids. Despite their freewheeling sexual behaviors, adolescents often are ignorant about sex, AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases. However, evidence from programs in the military and the gay community suggests that AIDS education can be effective in getting individuals to modify their risky behaviors. A national AIDS hotline and a variety of public information materials on AIDS and its transmissions and prevention are available. Public and private organizations offering information, services, and other resources on AIDS and adolescents are listed.

AB  - Educators are pressed to take seriously their obligation for improving success in school for failure-expectant children and for changing the means used to achieve learning outcomes. This dissertation describes the processes, activities and suggested strategies for integrating staff development, parent outreach and after-school skill support for a small group of low-income Black children targeted for retention at the fifth grade. The project comprised three elements: an after-school skills development/homework hurdle program; a staff development program focusing on encouraging high teacher expectations for all children and a parent outreach program. The project sought to enable minority, failure-expectant children to experience success. Teachers practiced positive interactional and support skills designed to demonstrate an understanding of how their behaviors and expectations impacted on student achievement. The after-school project and staff development component incorporated characteristics drawn from the effective-schools research, such as: (a) the principal's leadership and attention to the quality of instruction, (b) school climate contributing to teaching and learning, (c) high expectations for performance of all students, (d) teachers committed to bringing all children to at least minimum mastery, and (e) assessing and monitoring student achievement. The project had positive effects on student achievement as measured on standardized tests and report card grades, as well as student behaviors. Teachers held higher expectations, practiced effective teaching strategies, and interacted more with colleagues and parents. Educators have a strong knowledge base for school improvement activities among current staffs, but there are no fixed methods or standard blueprints to explain how to combine people, ideas and programs to create a setting that meets all the diverse needs presented by poor and minority children with a history of limited academic achievement. Viewing change as a process, the after-school project directly assisted at risk students in ways that helped teachers modify their strategies and organizational routines to meet educational needs of Black, failure-expectant children. With commitment and accountability for success, learning outcomes increased through staff development, parent outreach, attention to learning readiness, social competencies, and mastery of basic skills. Failure-expectant students came to think of themselves as capable of learning; and their gains helped teachers see the importance of positive expectations. The principal also increased a repertoire of school improvement strategies.

AB  - This report examines the intersection of issues of health, mortality, and homelessness in America. It first illustrates the suffering of homeless Americans through biographical sketches of a few of the homeless men, women, and children who died in 1991. It then provides new information on the health status of the homeless population and issues that affect access to health, housing, and other needed services. The study reports that although no complete national count is available on the deaths of homeless people, information from just 19 cities documents the deaths of at least 750 homeless persons during 1991. Most of those who died were middle-aged. Common causes of death included exposure, AIDS, complications from alcoholism, accidents, homicide, and other violence. Other study findings are that serious health problems often cause homelessness, and the environmental hazards of homelessness cause serious health problems. Homeless people suffer from both acute and chronic illnesses at much higher rates than the general population. The study further concludes that safety-net programs that are designed to protect people unable to work due to long-term disability are not effective. The report recommends that the Federal Government enact legislation that provides all Americans with universal access to health care, immediately raise Supplemental Security Income benefits to cover the rising cost of housing, and implement a nationwide outreach program to assist homeless persons who are eligible for, but are not currently receiving, Social Security disability benefits. Recommendations for local action are also included. Two tables and 82 footnotes are included.

AB  - The morbidities that affect children who have limited access to health care and who are at risk of failing to reach their optimum health and potential are as much the result of social circumstances as they are the result of an inaccessible health care system. Children growing up in poverty encounter many obstacles that prevent them from seeking or receiving the services of one of the most sophisticated health care industries in the world. A combination of financial barriers, hurdles of distance, inappropriate hours, fragmented and impersonal services, the absence of outreach and follow-up, and cultural differences deprive children of needed services.

AB  - Provides an anthropologist's fieldwork-driven construction of active citizenship and interpretations of the meaning of homelessness, charity, and work. The practices of and responses to 'character beggars' are contrasted with those of panhandlers. It is argued that beggars motivate others to give by presenting themselves in a way that connects them with others on an emotional level and that citizens display certain values as they place themselves among the giving/homed and identify their fellow citizens as types of begging/homeless takers. Implications of fieldwork for ethnographic representation are contrasted with those of fieldwork as an aspect of 'homework,' a self-consciously moral and political act that cannot be presumed consistent with shared identity based on locality, race, gender, or other categoric distinctions. Comments from various anthropologists and a reply from the author are included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Criminologists generally agree that employment prevents crime. However, the available research data reveals that under adverse conditions, employment fails to nurture the development of youth of school age and is actually harmful to them. The labor market for youth is shaped by economic interests in society. Most youth work to support a materialistic lifestyle desired as a result of marketing campaigns. Most employers in fast-food restaurants and certain other highly competitive sectors of the economy turn to youth as a source of inexpensive and transient labor that requires little corporate or managerial investment. Policies that would reshape the labor market and provide meaningful work more widely for juveniles and adults would be desirable, but such a transformation is not likely soon. Moreover, programs aimed at easing the transition of youth into the primary labor market are scarce. Thus, pushing youth into low-paying jobs that provide little human, social, or cultural capital will likely consign them to the secondary labor market and a life of underemployment. Therefore, more emphasis is needed on programs that prevent delinquency by promoting healthy psychosocial development and building skills needed to take part in post-industrial society. 82 references

AB  - Like a tapestry woven with one outstanding thread from beginning to end, the author's forty-year tenure as an art educator has its golden thread in her Van Go art outreach project. Quite literally, she takes students in a "van" and they "go," mostly on dirt roads, taking art to rural schools in Idaho, some of which have no more than three students in the entire school. In the 1970s, the Prairie School was their maiden adventure: up highway 20, through mule deer and sagebrush, across Cow Creek Bridge, past pictographs, and up treacherous, dusty, and winding roads. Word-of-mouth soon carried them to other remote locations throughout Idaho. Project Van Go promotes self-esteem for many at-risk students and student-teachers new to the teaching profession. It also brings art to disenfranchised schools that do not have the benefit of art curriculums, art supplies, or art teachers.

AB  - Formative work to inform interventions aimed at addressing drug and sexual risk behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM) in South Africa highlighted the need to target drug-using MSM with prevention interventions addressing both sexual and drug-related HIV risk. From 2007, in collaboration with two local NGOs, intervention activities were rolled out to vulnerable drug-using MSM. Over the first two years, 3475 drug-using MSM were reached through community outreach that promotes HIV/AIDS prevention and addresses drug risk behaviours and 745 among them were tested for HIV and received their results and 239 of them were referred from HCT to other services. Additionally, 66 individuals were trained to promote HIV/AIDS prevention services and 15 were trained in HCT. Twelve new targeted condom and lubrication services and 7 new HCT outlets were established. MSM reported a variety of high-risk activities including not using condoms for anal sex, having sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and sharing needles (among injection drug users). However, MSM were willing to develop risk reduction strategies. Year one and two of the intervention has demonstrated the willingness of the NGOs to broaden their service delivery, improved integration of drug treatment, HIV intervention and other services, and has shown positive results across a number of risk behaviours among MSM.

AB  - This dissertation provides a sociocultural portrait of two marketplaces in Istanbul: the Grand Bazaar, reputedly the world’s oldest still-operating market, and ?stiklâl Street, the nineteenth-century boulevard once known as the Grande Rue de Péra. Sometime cosmopolitan hubs of an imperial capital with a non-Muslim majority, as Istanbul’s population has quadrupled during recent decades, these marketplaces have emerged as spaces where diverse rural-to-urban migrants are attempting to incorporate themselves into a service sector in the grip of economic reform. Based on documentary sources, oral history, and two years fieldwork, I examine how commercial life has transformed in these marketplaces since the late twentieth-century, years which have seen the Grand Bazaar develop into one of the world’s largest tourist sites and the nightlife market in Taksim become a crucible for youth subcultures, including an elaborate gay scene. Focusing on the souvenir business of an Alevi Kurdish family in the bazaar and a partnership between two gay nightlife entrepreneurs, I show that even as these markets have become entangled in larger governmental projects of economic development, commerce in the two milieux has come to resonate in unexpected ways with Clifford Geertz’s classic model of a bazaar economy and Walter Benjamin’s characterisation of an arcade. I argue that interpersonal encounters in these two socially heterogeneous markets—“making bazaar” (i.e. bargaining) and “making street” (i.e. promenading)—afford distinct spaces of disclosure where people explore the possibilities of exchange for articulating varieties of social difference. Even as non-Muslim minorities in these marketplaces have been largely replaced by other minorities, I suggest that certain patterns of pluralism historically associated with the Ottoman millet system inflect how people deal with ethnonational difference in the bazaar in terms of “country” and how people appeal to “culture” as they navigate sexual possibilities in the nightlife market. Developing an ethnographic approach to interdisciplinary debates on neoliberalism and cosmopolitanism, my dissertation outlines a methodology for investigating how people themselves explore changing markets, probing the potential of emergent forms of belonging—like my informants, discovering what country can be if not a nation and what culture can be if not a consensus.

AB  - The author reflects on how youth workers should respond to violent crime committed by a young person associated with youth work projects in Great Britain. According to him, youth workers should consider several dimensions to any response such as the circumstances of a young person dying. He mentions key moments that need to guide any response which include during the news of death breaks, at the preparations for burial or cremation, immediately after these formalities and in months that follow.

AB  - This paper explores how two teacher candidates in an equity-focused preparation program negotiated among multiple perspectives about teaching the English Language Arts in linguistically and culturally diverse teaching contexts. We present cases of two preservice teachers (PTs) who experienced tensions in their development as a result of ideological coherence within program coursework. One PT experienced tensions in fieldwork with colleagues who thought differently about English teaching, and another PT experienced tensions within coursework as he struggled to find space to engage in his own inquiries beyond the required curriculum. This paper contributes to research about how teacher education can support PTs' ability to negotiate complex and sometimes conflicting demands of multiple communities they work in as educators.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize the relationship of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in Vietnam veterans to criminal behavior. A conceptual framework is discussed which proposes that the disposition to criminal behavior is determined by whether or not the veteran enters into the survivor mode of functioning as a behavioral defense mechanism against the disorder. It is hypothesized that there exists a relationship between the severity of PTSD and the tendency to commit illegal acts. The Vietnam Era Stress Inventory (Wilson and Krauss, 1980) was used to assess PTSD among a volunteer national sample of Vietnam combat veterans (N = 114) participating in the Veterans Administration's counseling program known as Operation Outreach. The results strongly supported the hypothesis and indicated that combat role variables, exposure to stressors in Vietnam and the severity of PTSD were significantly correlated with criminal acts.

AB  - This . . . textbook has now been fully revised and updated from its original 1990 edition. Comprising a compendium of ergonomics methods and techniques which is both broad and deep, it covers every aspect of human work and is carefully designed and written to accompany and complement other texts on ergonomics and human factors principles and theory. New and old readers alike will be delighted by the revision of chapters on the framework and context of methodology, the observation of performance, task analysis, experimental and study design, data collection, product assessment, environmental assessment, measurement of work and the evaluation of work systems (human–computer interface, computer-aided design and work stress). There are 5 entirely new chapters on control room ergonomics, psychophysiological functions, ergonomics risk assessment, fieldwork and participatory work design. Readers of 'Evaluation of Human Work' will be as diverse as its contents. They may be students seeking an introduction for ergonomics investigation; industrial, business, or human-service-oriented professionals seeking an understanding of what ergonomics can offer; or qualified ergonomists seeking to inform their practice.

AB  - Twenty-seven five-year-olds walk into kindergarten on the first day of school in southeastern Kentucky. On average, nine of those children live in poverty, two were born to mothers who did not complete high school, two were removed from their homes because of abuse or neglect, and fourteen are from single-parent homes: this according to statistics for the 22-county service area of Eastern Kentucky University (EKU) provided by Kentucky Youth Advocates. For several of these five-year-olds, school lunch and breakfast are the only meals they will eat that day. These children, their peers, families, schools, and communities are the focus of Eastern Kentucky University's regional stewardship initiative, which strives to reduce the barriers children face in obtaining an education and to enhance communities by developing programs to improve the quality of life in the area. EKU's new initiative: the educational extension agent program, is believed to be the first of its kind undertaken by any regional comprehensive university in the nation and designed to assist the schools and communities located in its 22-county service region.

AB  - In 2006, more than 6 million individuals were victimized by violent crimes. Although violence is below levels of the early 1990s, it remains high. The extent of violence and its impact highlight a critical need to develop and implement effective programs to reduce violence and victimization. Communities have initiated a wide range of such programs, and scholars have conducted numerous evaluations of varying quality of them. Reviews have found certain types of strategies and specific programs to be promising, but additional critical evaluations are needed to plan violence-reduction programs. This monograph assesses the implementation and impact of the One Vision One Life violence-prevention strategy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2003, Pittsburgh witnessed a 49-percent increase in homicides, prompting a "grassroots" creation and implementation of the One Vision One Life antiviolence strategy. This initiative used a problem-solving, data-driven model, including street-level intelligence, to intervene in escalating disputes, and seeks to place youth in appropriate social programs. Analysis of the program, which is modeled on similar efforts elsewhere, can help inform other efforts to address urban violence. Four appendices are included: (1) The Observational Strategy; (2) Designation of Target, Spillover, and Counterfactual Neighborhoods; (3) Technical Detail on the Outcome Analysis; and (4) Outcomes of Full Models Used to Test for Intervention and Spillover Effects. Individual sections contain footnotes. A bibliography is provided. (Contains 40 tables and 7 figures.)

AB  - Similar to other parts of Asia, the HIV epidemic in Nepal is concentrated among a small number of groups, including transgender people, or Metis. This study was conducted to explore the social context of stigma among Metis in Nepal to better understand their risk for HIV. Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with Metis in Kathmandu, Nepal. We found that stigma from families leading to rural-urban migration exposed Metis to discrimination from law enforcement, employers and sexual partners, which influenced their risk for HIV. Specific HIV-related risks identified were rape by law enforcement officers, inconsistent condom use and high reported numbers of sexual partners. These data point to an immediate need to work with law enforcement to reduce violence targeting Metis. HIV prevention, housing and employment outreach to Metis in rural areas and those who migrate to urban areas is also needed. Finally, there is a need for more research to determine the prevalence of HIV among Metis, to explore risk within sexual networks and to better understand of the relationship between Metis and their families in order to develop future programmes and interventions. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Al igual que en otras partes de Asia, la epidemia del VIH en Nepal se concentra en un pequeño número de grupos, incluyendo a los transexuales o Metis. El objetivo de este estudio fue analizar el contexto social del estigma entre los Metis en Nepal para conocer mejor si corren riesgo de infectarse con el virus del sida. Se llevaron a cabo catorce entrevistas exhaustivas con Metis en Katmandú, Nepal. Descubrimos que el estigma de las familias causa una emigración del campo a la ciudad y expone a los Metis a una discriminación por parte de las fuerzas del orden, los patronos y los compañeros sexuales, lo que influye en el riesgo de contraer el VIH. Los riesgos específicos relacionados con la transmisión del VIH fueron la violación por parte de agentes de las fuerzas del orden, el uso irregular de preservativos y un alto número informado de compañeros sexuales. Estos datos señalan que para reducir la violencia contra los Metis, es necesario colaborar inmediatamente con los agentes de las fuerzas del orden. También es necesario crear programas que lleguen a los Metis sobre la prevención del VIH, la vivienda y el empleo en zonas rurales y para aquellos que emigren a las ciudades. Para terminar, habría que llevar a cabo más investigaciones a fin de determinar la prevalencia del VIH entre los Metis y analizar los riesgos en las redes sexuales, y comprender mejor la relación entre los Metis y sus familias con el objetivo de desarrollar futuros programas e intervenciones. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] De même que dans d'autres régions d'Asie, l'épidémie de sida au Népal est concentrée au sein d'un petit nombre de groupes comprenant les personnes transgenres, ou Metis. Cette étude a été conduite dans le but d'explorer le contexte social de la stigmatisation parmi les Metis au Népal pour permettre une meilleure compréhension de leurs risques liés au VIH. Quatorze entretiens en profondeur ont été conduits avec des Metis à Katmandou. Nous avons découvert que la stigmatisation dans les familles, qui entraîne une migration rurale-urbaine des Metis, exposait ces derniers à la discrimination engendrée par l'application des lois, les employeurs, et les partenaires sexuels ayant un impact sur leurs risques liés au VIH. Les risques spécifiquement liés au VIH ayant été identifiés sont le viol par des hommes chargés de faire respecter la loi, l'usage irrégulier du préservatif, et le nombre élevé de partenaires sexuels déclarés. Ces données mettent l'accent sur l'urgente nécessité d'une collaboration avec les organismes veillant à l'application des lois pour réduire la violence envers les Metis. Se rapprocher des Metis dans les zones rurales pour la prévention du VIH, le logement et l'emploi, et de ceux qui migrent vers des zones urbaines est également nécessaire. Enfin, il est également nécessaire que la recherche approfondisse les connaissances sur la prévalence du VIH parmi les Metis, les risques au sein des réseaux sexuels, et la compréhension de la relation entre les Metis et leurs familles afin que les futurs programmes et interventions puissent être élaborés.

AB  - Emergency management tends to be planned for legal, resident populations that are responsive to mainstream channels of communication and enforcement. For many areas prone to extreme events and emergencies, populations are also composed of transitory tourists, temporary visitors and migrant workers. This latter group may be a large population and, while not completely invisible to residents, may prefer obscurity and concealment within the social landscape. Tending towards poverty, technologically disconnected and linguistically isolated, undocumented migrants seek employment and attempt to avoid local law enforcement and immigration officials for fear of imprisonment and deportation. In this context, the behaviours prompted by developing public emergencies will be different for undocumented migrants than for the population at large. We examine the experience of 135 Hispanic undocumented migrants in the coastal zone of Houston-Galveston, Texas to understand the factors and issues that influence decision making and behaviours under region-wide mandatory evacuation conditions. Undocumented migrants' decisions to evacuate rest upon: the presence (or absence) of family and/or children, their access to risk information that they find meaningful and rational and is in harmony with their pre-conceptions about their circumstances, their openness to information that either confirms their experiences or confronts rumour-generated biases they carry, their familiarity with social groups and governmental agencies and the services they offer, and the outcome of their risk analyses that consider the dangers of remaining [italic]in situ[/italic] against the danger of exposing themselves to discovery as illegal aliens. The results suggest that emergency management plans ought to promote the dispelling of rumours that weaken the effect of emergency communication, promote non-emergency outreach to peripheral populations through community groups, and promote better, basic, non-technical, Spanish-language media through mainstream conduits (i.e. the most commonly watched non-Spanish television channels) that do not require high-tech devices or advanced understanding of visual media tools.

AB  - Programs that promote family literacy, as defined by Hannon (2003), are "programs to teach literacy that acknowledge and make use of learners' family relationships and engagement in family literacy practices." Why are such programs important for young learners? According to Livingston and Wirt (2003), children who have homes with books, and parents who read these books, show higher levels of reading skills and knowledge than children whose homes are less literacy rich. A study by the U.S. Department of Education (2001) provides further evidence that home-school connections are important. In this study, student progress in 71 high poverty schools was tracked as these students moved from third grade through fifth grade. Students from families that had strong parental outreach from schools showed a 50 percent higher growth in reading scores than students from families with low levels of parental outreach from schools. Another argument for programs that support literacy is the fact that when children are read to frequently, they begin to develop the skills needed to read successfully (Darling, 2005; Morrow and Young, 1997; Strickland and Morrow, 1990). With this information in mind, a family literacy project was developed with two main objectives: (1) to encourage parent/child participation in literacy activities and (2) to give preservice teachers the opportunity to develop literacy activities for families to engage in together.

AB  - The primary aim of this article is to report the survey findings of a recent study on users' views on the service provided by an outreaching social work team in Hong Kong. The inception of the outreaching programme in Hong Kong was in 1979 and its objective was that social workers should reach out to, and establish direct contact with, young people aged 6-24 in the places which they are known to frequent, notably playgrounds, parks, billiard halls and street corners. The objectives were to render services to help these youth at risk to develop their potential through education or training. more stable employment and social integration and to help solve their individual problems through counselling, guidance and other relevant services. An abundance of literature emphasizes that the views of users of social service programmes as well as the level of satisfaction of service recipients should not he ignored by the service providers. It goes without saying that assistance is best received where there is reciprocity between help givers and receivers. On the one hands it is vital for the social workers to understand the needs of their users. On the other, it is of equal importance for the users to know what their social workers can provide.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the association between childhood abuse, HIV-related sexual risks, and gender relations among African-American women. METHODS: The sample 165 African-American women, 18-29 years of age, were recruited by street outreach from a lower socioeconomic community in San Francisco, CA. A face-to-face interview was administered to assess HIV/STD-sexual risk practices, alcohol use, physical abuse, affective health, and relationship commitment. Childhood sexual abuse was defined as experiencing forced sex prior to age 16. RESULTS: The prevalence of childhood sexual abuse in this sample was 13.3%. Compared to women who were not abused during childhood, women who reported a history of childhood sexual abuse were 1.5 times more likely to have had an abortion, 1.4 times more likely to report having an STD, 2.4 times as likely to report having greater than two lifetime STDs, 3.8 times as likely to have a history of anal sex, 2.6 times as likely to worry about acquiring HIV, 3.9 times more likely to believe their partner did not care for them, twice as likely to doubt the longevity of their relationship, 5.1 times as likely to have a partner who had been physically abusive within the previous 3 months, 2.6 times as likely to have a partner who was physically abusive when asked to use condoms, and 1.5 times as likely to consume three or more glasses of alcohol at one time. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of a women's history of child sexual abuse can assist in making appropriate medical and social referrals and can lead to the development of more tailored HIV prevention programs for African-American women.

AB  - Background: African Americans have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality than other ethnic groups. Young adults are prime targets for intervention strategies to prevent and reduce disease risk. The study purpose was to determine the level of knowledge of lifestyle risk factors for CVD among young African American adults in Phoenix. The results will be used to guide the development of CVD outreach programs targeted to this population. The Health Belief Model was used as a conceptual framework. Methods: A convenience sample of 172 African American men and women aged 18-26 years completed a questionnaire adapted from the American Heart Association national surveys. Descriptive statistics were compared by age, gender, education level, and health status variables including BMI, smoking status, and physical activity. Results: Some aspects of heart-disease were well known among young adult African Americans. Knowledge of certain other important risk factors (menopause) and preventive behaviors (eating fewer animal products), however, was more variable and inconsistent among the respondents. Differences in knowledge of individual variables was greater by education level than by gender overall. Predictors of a summary CVD knowledge score included higher education, female gender, and high self-efficacy (adjusted R2 = 0.158, p < .001). Predictors of self-efficacy in changing CVD risk were higher education and perceived low risk of CVD (adjusted R2 = 0.064, p < .001), but these characteristics explained only 6% of the variance. Conclusions: Evaluation of baseline knowledge of CVD is essential before designing and implementing health promotion programs. Existing strengths and weaknesses in knowledge can guide tailoring of programs to be more effective. Further research would help to identify the range of other characteristics that determine knowledge and risk perception.

AB  - Objectives: We determined relationships between food behaviors and health-risk factors by acculturation among limited-income Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women. Methods: Women aged 18-49 years were recruited from income-based programs in metro-Phoenix, Arizona. Self-administered surveys in English or Spanish included demographics, a 10-item food behavior checklist, health-risk factors, food security, and acculturation. Differences by 4 acculturation/ethnicity categories were assessed with chi-square and analysis of variance (ANOVA). We created a food behavior scale. Results: Eighty-two percent self-identified as Hispanic (N = 358), with 45% Hispanic-dominant, 25% bicultural, 12% English-dominant, and 18% non-Hispanic white for acculturation status. Food behavior checklist results showed that English-dominant Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women were more likely to feed their children soon after waking, refrigerate meat/dairy promptly, not add salt to food, smoke cigarettes and be food insecure (p < .001). Education, not acculturation, was a significant predictor of the food behavior scale. BMI did not differ by acculturation, but 33% of Hispanic-dominant Latinas did not know their height and/or weight. These less acculturated Latinas had significantly greater food security, but lacked health insurance and years of education. Conclusions: Program outreach tailored by acculturation that considers educational level is needed to emphasize existing positive behaviors and address knowledge gaps among low socioeconomic women to improve health and reduce disparities.

THE STATUS OF ALCOHOL AND DRINKING IN AMERICAN SOCIETY IS CONSIDERED, WITH REFERENCE TO THE SKID ROW PHENOMENON AND TO STATISTICS ON THE DRINKING HABITS OF FEMALES, YOUTHS, AND ETHNIC GROUPS. THEORIES REGARDING THE GENESIS OF ALCOHOLISM ARE REVIEWED, AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DRINKING ARE DESCRIBED. VARIOUS TYPOLOGIES OF DRINKING STATES, INCLUDING ONE BASED ON THE DISEASE MODEL OF ALCOHOLISM, ARE NOTED. THE TREATMENT OF ALCOHOLIC OFFENDERS IN THE COURTS AND IN PRISONS AND JAILS IS DISCUSSED, AS IS THE PROBLEM OF DRUNK DRIVING. SEVERAL APPROACHES TO TREATING ALCOHOLISM--DISULFIRAM MEDICATION, ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, DIVERSION AND CIVIL COMMITMENT PROGRAMS, EMPLOYER-SPONSORED PROGRAMS, RELIGIOUS-SPONSORED OUTREACH TREATMENT (E.G., THE SALVATION ARMY'S SKID ROW PROGRAMS), AND HALFWAY HOUSES--ARE SUMMARIZED, AND THE CONTROVERSY OVER THE GOAL OF TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOLISM (ABSTINENCE VERSUS MODERATION) IS NOTED. ESTIMATES OF THE SOCIAL COSTS OF ALCOHOLISM ARE QUOTED. ALCOHOL-RELATED POLICY DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE AREAS OF DECRIMINALIZATION OF PUBLIC DRUNKENNESS AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ALCOHOL, ARE REVIEWED. THE FOLLOWING PREDICTIONS ARE OFFERED: (1) ALCOHOLIC OFFENDERS WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR SOCIETY, BUT THEIR DIRECT INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL LESSEN AS THE TREND TOWARD DECRIMINALIZATION OF PUBLIC DRUNKENNESS CONTINUES; (2) TREATMENT PROCEDURES BASED ON THE MOTIVATIONAL STRUCTURES OF MIDDLE-AGED PERSONS MAY HAVE TO BE MODIFIED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INCREASING NUMBER OF YOUNG ALCOHOLICS; (3) ALCOHOLISM TREATMENT AND RESEARCH, WHICH HAS DEVELOPED LARGELY OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONS OF MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE AND RESEARCH, WILL BE INTEGRATED WITH WORK IN RELATED SCIENTIFIC AND SERVICE AREAS AS ALCOHOLISM BECOMES MORE VISIBLE AND ENGAGES MORE RESOURCES; AND (4) MANY OF THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT ALCOHOLISM WILL BE ADDRESSED BY THE FIVE ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTERS ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN 1977.

AB  - Every State has an alcoholic beverage control agency which establishes and enforces rules for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. A person may be a social drinker, a heavy drinker, a problem drinker, or an alcoholic, in ascending order of gravity of possible consequences. Theories that explain the genesis of alcoholism pertain to psychoanalytic concepts, personality theory, family factors, self-concept, physiological predisposition, operant conditioning, and anomie. In addition to organ damage, excessive alcohol use has a variety of negative effects on family functioning, job performance, and ability to pursue other goals. In samples of chronic inebriate offenders, only about one-third had criminal histories that included serious crime. Alcohol's release of inhibitions may contribute to criminal behavior. At this writing, courts are apparently unable or unwilling to impose harsh sentences on drunk drivers, and police are lax in enforcing drunk-driving laws. Treatment for alcoholism includes the use of an aversive drug that reacts to alcohol, participation in Alcoholics Anonymous, diversion and civil commitment for alcoholic offenders, occupational alcoholism programs, religious outreach treatment, and halfway houses. 58 references.

AB  - Rates of death from opioid overdose continue to rise in the United States. One harm reduction strategy designed to reduce fatal overdose risk among people who inject drugs (PWID) is an advisory to not use drugs alone. However, the feasibility and acceptability of this message have not been evaluated. Objectives: This paper explores the drug use practices of young PWID related to injecting alone and reasons for doing so. Methods: From 2015 to 2016, 23 in-depth interviews were completed in Baltimore, Maryland with young PWID. Participants were recruited through street/venue-based outreach and word of mouth. Inclusion criteria were 1) age 18-30 and 2) self-report injection drug use in past 6 months. Participants were asked about drug use history, overdose knowledge/experiences, and injection-related practices including when, where, and with whom drugs were injected. Results: Injecting drugs alone was common among members of this sample. Reasons for injecting alone included 1) the desire to alleviate withdrawal symptoms, 2) feelings of shame regarding one's drug use, 3) lack of knowledge about Good Samaritan Laws, 4) financial circumstances, and 5) a lack of trusted peers with whom to inject, often due to disrupted social networks. Conclusions: Young PWID inject alone for a variety of reasons, putting them at increased risk of fatal overdose. These findings demonstrate that "don't use alone" messages may not be sufficient given the complex realities of PWID's injection practices. Harm reduction programs employing such messaging should also offer alternative options for overdose prevention/risk reduction for those who do inject alone.

AB  - [...]when the bipartisan neoconservative/neoliberal compromise legislation of 1996, the "Personal Responsibility [neoconservative] and Work Opportunity [neoliberal] Reconciliation Act", was signed into law by Bill Clinton, the inadequate and repressive AFDC program became "Temporary Assistance to Needy Families", temporary not only in intent, but in practice. The fieldwork was done in Kingston after Clark's 2002 welfare reform, replacing much of the harsher, more punitive "Ruthanasia" provisions with ones that nominally support recipient initiative, and in Alberta after PCA welfare reforms had taken effect. [...]in Aotearoa/New Zealand, the directives from the central office positioned "clients as knowledgeable and competent" (65), conceptualizing poverty as structural in origin, so that the interventions encouraged people to be entrepreneurial, while paying attention to "the cost and availability of child care, health problems and health care accessibility, housing costs, access to tertiary education, and wage and benefit rates" (69).

AB  - Reviews the book, Psychiatry Takes to the Streets: Outreach and Crisis Intervention for the Mentally Ill edited by Neal L. Cohen (see record [rid]1990-97869-000[/rid]). Advocates for community services for people with mental illness invariably include in their litany a call for aggressive outreach and mobile, flexible crisis intervention. It is less clear from the literature, however, just what such services entail, what demands are placed on mental health professionals, or what the practical results of these services might be for client well-being. This volume makes a major contribution by offering readers a rich collection of conceptual and practical insights into what mobile, imaginative practice of community psychiatry might look like. The greatest strength of Psychiatry Takes to the Streets is that it maintains a single-minded focus on this one component. This volume presents a variety of papers, most of which describe program development approaches to serving the most difficult clients, often under very taxing circumstances.

AB  - Background Female sex workers (FSW) and people who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for HIV infection, with FSW-PWID at even greater risk. HIV-related research often focuses on the primary mode of transmission – sexual or parenteral transmission for FSW and PWID, respectively – with less known on how sex work and injection drug use (IDU) are collectively associated with the risk environment experienced by sex workers. We investigated this relationship among FSW in three Russian cities. Methods In 2011, FSWs ( N = 754) in Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk, and Kazan were recruited via respondent-driven sampling and completed a survey and rapid HIV screening. Multivariable models evaluated the role of injection history (classified as active: last 6 months, former: prior to last 6 months, and never) with a set of sexual and structural HIV risk outcomes. Results IDU was common: 11% actively injected drugs and 11% were former injectors. HIV infection was most prevalent among active injectors (AOR: 6.7; 95% CI: 2.4–18.9) and former injectors (AOR:4.5; 95%CI: 1.7–11.6), compared to non-injectors. Some 6–8% of non-injecting FSWs reported recent physical or sexual client violence and 23% police extortion. Compared to these non-injectors, active injecting was associated with unprotected anal sex (AOR: 2.8, 95%CI: 1.2–6.4), client violence (AOR: 7.3, 95%CI: 2.1–24.7), and police extortion (AOR: 3.0 95%CI: 1.5–5.9%). Self-reported sexual and structural risk outcomes were also more prevalent among active compared to former injectors; however, few differences existed between former and non-injectors. Conclusions FSW experience sexual, structural, and HIV risk outcomes and these risks are amplified for actively injecting FSWs. FSW who stopped injecting drugs demonstrated risk profiles closer to those of sex workers who had no history of injection. HIV prevention programs and outreach can provide opportunities to include harm reduction interventions and linkage to treatment for FSW to move FSWs towards lower risk environments.

AB  - Because of their needle-sharing behavior and sexual activity with other drug abusers, IV drug abusers are at high risk for contracting AIDS. This is the primary means for transmitting the disease to the heterosexual population. Although this is not currently a significant problem in Wisconsin compared to other States, a preventive strategy is required. The task force recommends the institution of ongoing collection of information on IV drug abusers and the effectiveness of programs that treat them. Also recommended are the ongoing education of drug abuse agency personnel and clients regarding AIDS/HIV, the development of 'street outreach' programs to bring IV drug abusers into treatment, and the expansion of methadone maintenance and other drug treatment programs. Also recommended are the education of criminal justice personnel and clients about AIDS/HIV; the implementation of prevention, treatment, and clinical activities for women at risk; and the development of targeted messages and educational materials for distribution by drug abuse and 'street outreach' personnel. The development of comprehensive programs for the care of HIV-infected IV drug abusers, their partners, and their children is recommended as well. Suggestions for implementing these recommendations are provided. 27-item selected bibliography.

AB  - When community members volunteer for young people, they forge pathways of knowledge and compassion, and gain a better understanding of the mission and challenges of the schools. Youth service-learning programs that give high school and middle school students the chance to work with younger students or on community projects also leave lasting impressions of the benefits of volunteering, the gift of self. This resource guide to help schools start or enhance their volunteer programs is distributed by Volunteer-A-Thon, a community outreach project of Wisconsin Public Television (WPT) The guide is in three parts. Part 1, "Volunteer-A-Thon Participation," gives an overview of the program, lists ideas for school participation in the program, and contains sample forms. Part 2, "Adult Volunteers in the School," presents a step-by-step process for starting a volunteer program, and includes a sample design and organization for a volunteer program. This section also provides guidelines for teachers' use of volunteers, suggests ways to give recognition to volunteers, lists ideas for family and retired persons volunteering, describes student mentoring and intergenerational programs, and outlines risk management. Part 3, "Youth Service-Learning," describes opportunities for student volunteerism, including the Learn and Serve American grants; core elements of effective service-learning activities; integrating service learning into the curriculum; outcomes of youth service-learning; and tips for organizing a youth service-learning program. Appendices include a family-community-school partnership project directory for Wisconsin and a checklist of practices and programs to encourage family and community support of children's learning.

AB  - Teenage motherhood is a pressing issue in the United States, and one that is disproportionately affecting racial/ethnic minorities. In this research, we examine the relationship between the distance to the nearest reproductive health clinic and teenage birth rates across all zip codes in Houston, Texas. Our primary data come from the Texas Department of State Health Services. We use spatial regression analysis techniques to examine the link between clinic proximity and local teenage birth rates for all females aged 15 to 19, and separately by maternal race/ethnicity. We find, overall, limited support for a connection between clinic distance and local teenage birth rates. However, clinics seem to matter most for explaining non-Hispanic white teenage birth rates, particularly in high-poverty zip codes. The racial/ethnic and economic variation in the importance of clinic distance suggests tailoring clinic outreach to more effectively serve a wider range of teenage populations. We argue social accessibility should be considered in addition to geographic accessibility in order for clinics to help prevent teenage pregnancy.

AB  - Exploring fertility preferences in relation to contraceptive use can increase the understanding of future reproductive behaviour and unmet family planning needs. This knowledge can help assist women in meeting their reproductive goals. The influences on the desire for more children and current contraceptive use were examined among 1528 married women of reproductive age in an isolated community in Bali, Indonesia, using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Women who were younger, had fewer living children, had given birth in the past year and had regular access to health services were more likely to desire children. Being older, having fewer living children, not having regular access to health services, having given birth in the past year and having the desire for more children were associated with a lower likelihood of using contraception. Women with regular access to health care are more likely to desire more children, probably because they are confident in their ability to have successful birth outcomes. However, specialized clinics or family planning outreach workers may be required to reduce barriers to service utilization among some groups. The findings of this study identify key target populations for family planning, including older women and postpartum women - groups that may not perceive themselves to be at risk for unintended pregnancy. Meeting unmet need for family planning among these groups could help women meet their fertility goals, as well as reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.

AB  - This paper describes the setting up and the first year of running of an innovative outreach service for adolescents on the edge of care that aimed at redressing family breakdown and preventing placements in the care system. It was a collaborative endeavour between social services and a child and adolescent mental health provision to facilitate the engagement of hard to reach young people and families that often presented high levels of risk. This article describes a distinctive model of applied psychoanalytic work with individuals, families and the networks of practitioners and agencies around the case. It focuses on the integration of two perspectives: the individual and the family on the one hand and the organisation on the other. Case examples illustrate how our psychoanalytic and developmental framework illuminated our understanding of frequently extreme acting out behaviour and parental difficulties in terms of underlying intergenerational trauma, which was often re-enacted. This framework also helped in understanding the difficulties that practitioners experienced and how these related to individual and family dynamics. The article describes the significance of containment in the treatment of adolescents and families in crisis as well as in supporting the professional network.

AB  - Not all children growing up in the poverty of Third World shantytowns have poor health. This study examined relationships between child health and household characteristics and resources in a shantytown with the objective of identifying factors associated with good child health status, despite conditions of poverty. The fieldwork, conducted from July 1993 to July 1994 in the shantytown of Atucucho in Quito, Ecuador, used multidisciplinary techniques combining qualitative and quantitative methods. Interviews and participant observations were conducted with home-based daycare workers and mothers of young children in the community. Following a complete enumeration of the shantytown population, a cross-sectional survey with 302 mothers of children 12 to 30 months old was completed and anthropometric measurements of each child were taken. The study focused on two measures of health: nutritional status based on weight-for-age measurements, and maternal perception of child health. Independent variables were grouped into three descriptive domains: socioeconomic and environmental, social resources and health practices. Data analysis consisted of bivariate and logistic regression. Results indicate that nutritional status and maternal perception of child health are distinct dimensions of child health. Two socioeconomic and environmental variables, housing risk index and home/type ownership, were associated with better nutritional status and good material perception of child health respectively. One health practice variable, vaccinations-up-to-date, was positively associated with better nutritional status. The importance of social resource variables as predictors of good child health status is evident in the findings. Children with no siblings under five, whose mothers did not work for pay, and whose mothers had emergency financial support available to them were more likely to be in better nutritional status than children who did not have these characteristics. Children whose mothers self-reported health status was good, who had help in household chores and whose fathers were not present in the household were more likely to be perceived of in good health. Child's illness status was also associated with maternal perception of child health. The study results suggest international child health programs focused on growing, urban shantytowns should avoid placing additional stress on mothers. To improve child health, programs should encourage improvements in water, sanitation, housing, transportation, and vaccination coverage, and incorporate social support and strengthening of local social networks to reduce the chronic stress of mothers living in poverty.

AB  - To elucidate injection initiation and risky injection practices among young drug users (YDUs) in Amsterdam, this study identifies self-reported motives for injecting and not injecting to inform interventions to be targeted at issues personally relevant for this population. A qualitative study was performed using in-depth interviews to obtain retrospective drug use histories. Recruitment took place both directly (by street outreach, outreach at methadone outposts) and indirectly (by respondent-driven sampling). The study started in the year 2001 and included 50 YDUs, aged 18–30, of which 18 had a history of injecting. Reasons for not starting injection were fears of needles, overstepping a limit, damage to appearance, fears of missing veins and causing abscesses, and illnesses. Reasons for starting injection were stronger effect or rush, curiosity, economy, knowing injectors, and perceived lack of danger to health. Motives for injecting and not injecting can differ widely individually. Some strong motives are hardly addressed by prevention programs and should inform new prevention initiatives. Users’ own motives for not injecting should be promoted, whereas their motives for initiation should be counter-balanced with factual information.

AB  - Aims: To explore unmet, health-care needs and barriers to health-care use among young adult, problematic drug users in Amsterdam. Method: A qualitative study using indepth interviews was conducted. Recruitment took place both directly (by street outreach; outreach at methadone outposts) and indirectly (by respondent-driven sampling). The exploratory study started in 2001 and included 50 problematic drug users. Results: High rates of unmet needs were found in the sample. Respondents reported needing immediate help with organizing basic needs, such as housing, finances, and employment. Half of the respondents wanted help with giving up drug use. Barriers hindering appropriate healthcare utilization often mentioned were: lack of personal supervision, help not based on client input, fragmentation of support, waiting lists, completing treatment was optional, and focusing too much on abstinence. Conclusions: Health-care services for the respondents were accessible but often were not optimal. Considering patients' opinions about barriers to their treatment can facilitate their utilization of services. From the barriers that drug users named, it was apparent that service users wanted a longstanding helping alliance with professionals. They also objected to being molded to the objectives and goals of the different services, and they felt that support should be focused more on them as individuals. From the concerns expressed about the barriers to services, it was clear that services fail to assume full responsibility for their clients and that service provision is currently not individually tailored.

AB  - Objective: This study identifies self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin among young problem users in Amsterdam to enable interventions to be targeted at issues personally relevant for this population. Method: A qualitative study using in-depth interviews to obtain retrospective drug use histories. Recruitment took place both directly (by street outreach, outreach at methadone outposts) and indirectly (by respondent-driven sampling). The study started in the year 2001 and included 50 problem drug users, aged 18-30, of whom 72% were male, 64% were polydrug users, and 36% were homeless. Results: The seven most common self-reported factors facilitating initiation of cocaine and heroin are desire for affect regulation, drug availability, curiosity, desire to be part of a group, misinformation, desire for energy, and starting because it has a depressant effect. Conclusion: Some factors perceived to facilitate initiation of cocaine and/or heroin revealed in this study are hardly addressed by current prevention programs and could inform future initiatives. Programs can be targeted at young people who we identified to be at high risk. Research using quantitative methods is likely to be valuable in determining the relative importance of mentioned factors for different groups of young people. The study's limitations are noted.

AB  - In this paper, we explore whether the specific design of a state's program has contributed to its success in meeting two objectives of the Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP): increasing the health insurance coverage of children in lower-income families and doing so with a minimum reduction in their private health insurance coverage (crowd-out). In our analysis, we use two years of Current Population Survey data, 2000 and 2001, matched with detailed data on state programs. We focus on two populations: the eligible population of children, broadly defined--those living in families with incomes below 300 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL)--and a narrower group of children, those who we estimate are eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. Unique state program characteristics in the analysis include whether the state plan covers families; whether the state uses presumptive eligibility; the number of months without private coverage that are required for eligibility; whether there is an asset test; whether a face-to-face interview is required; and specific outreach activities. Our results provide evidence that state program characteristics are significant determinants of program success.

AB  - Implementation of interventions in community organisations such as schools, childcare centres, and sporting clubs are recommended to target a range of modifiable risks of non-communicable diseases. Poor implementation, however, is common and has contributed to the failure of non-communicable disease interventions globally. This study aimed to characterise experimental research regarding strategies to improve implementation of chronic disease prevention programs in community settings. The review used data collected in three comprehensive systematic reviews undertaken between August 2015 and July 2017. Randomised controlled trials, including cluster design, and non-randomised trials with a parallel control group were included. The data were extracted to describe trial characteristics, implementation strategies employed, implementation outcomes and study quality. Of the 40 implementation trials included in the study, unhealthy diet was the most common risk factor targeted (n = 20). The most commonly reported implementation strategies were educational meetings (n = 38, 95%), educational materials (n = 36, 90%) and educational outreach visits (n = 29, 73%). Few trials were conducted 'at-scale' (n = 8, 20%) or reported adverse effects (n = 5, 13%). The reporting of implementation related outcomes; intervention adoption (n = 13, 33%); appropriateness (n = 11, 28%); acceptability (n = 8, 20%); feasibility (n = 8, 20%); cost (n = 3, 8%); and sustainability (n = 2, 5%); was limited. For the majority of trials, risk of bias was high for blinding of study personnel/participants and outcome assessors. Testing of strategies to improve implementation of non-communicable disease prevention strategies in community settings, delivered 'at-scale', utilising implementation frameworks, including a comprehensive range of implementation outcomes should be priority areas for future research in implementation science.

AB  - The academic expectations of kindergarten students has grown over the years. Students in kindergarten are now working on foundational skills that would previously have been taught in first grade. Students begin kindergarten with the expectation that they possess school readiness skills. The absence of those skills results in the possibility of being evaluated for a special education disability. It is impossible for evaluators to know whether students are lacking school readiness skills due to a delay in development or a lack of exposure to these skills. The Caesar Rodney School District has seen an increase in the identification of students with a special education disability at the start of kindergarten, many coming from backgrounds that indicate there is a lack of exposure rather than a true delay in development. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect a parent outreach program used to educate parents on the skills needed for the start of kindergarten would have on the number of students being identified with a special education disability. The study analyzed the effect on 52 students who participated in the parent outreach program from targeted high-risk neighborhoods. Although the parent outreach program struggled to draw out families from high risk neighborhoods, the data suggest that the program contributed to a reduction in the number of students identified with a special education disability at the start of kindergarten. The results from this study indicate that continued parent and student outreach for students at the pre-kindergarten level is necessary in order to prepare them for the skills needed at the start of kindergarten.

AB  - This chapter describes an outreach worker's experience with street children in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The author worked with a Dominican nongovernmental organization (NGO) and the clients were children who were homeless or near homeless. One of the most important lessons I learned during my time working street outreach in Santo Domingo was that street children, despite the hardships and challenges in their lives, were incredibly well adjusted to the lives they lived. In particular, the relationship between the physical environment of the city and the peer groups they developed to overcome the challenges demonstrated that there was a vibrant subculture created to offset exclusion from broader Dominican society. Peer socialization is an adaptation to difficult environments; some of the behaviors and values may not be healthy, but they have fostered a certain resiliency in body and spirit.

AB  - Ethnographers may experience troubling relationships while conducting research. Strained interpersonal relationships with members of the communities where ethnographers work can be caused by emotional entanglements, acts of violence, or betrayal. When harm occurs, ethnographers are faced with ethical and emotional challenges about reporting one's experience versus descriptions of social facts. This article compares desahogarse, a way of speaking on Dominican streets used to express everyday betrayals, with the genre of the narrative ethnography to explore modes of presenting the contextualized self in fieldwork. In particular, the use of the textual strategies of perspective and composite characters and events are explored as writing approaches when faced with a troubled fieldwork relationship that had ethical implications on the access to the street community being researched. Ethnographers should consider the ethical, representational, and analytical gains of an ethnography that relies on a deliberate, if partial, exploration of the emotional experiences of fieldwork.

AB  - By matching families experiencing both short-term and long-term crises with trained volunteers and staff who provide objective caring support and resources, Women in Crisis has helped these special victims of crime, while also having a positive impact on Connecticut's criminal justice system. The Court Outreach and Family Support Project provides services and support on a matched, one-to-one basis to families during the first 6 to 8 weeks of adjustment, although followup contact can continue until the offender is released from prison if the family so desires. The Visitor Information Project provides assistance to people visiting the Somers and Cheshire Youth Institutions. Trained volunteers provide information on institutional rules and regulations, as well as available community services. The Return to Community Project provides counseling to offenders and their families throughout the period from pretrial to release. Special emphasis is placed on the needs of inmates and families just prior to release. Counselors also provide inservice training and seminars to civic, religious, social, and inmate groups throughout the State. The Sesame Street Playgroup Project at the Connecticut Correctional Institution makes the possibly frightening experience of visiting an incarcerated family member a learning experience. Children 2 to 10-years-old have fun, educational experiences, and an opportunity to work through their anxieties under the guidance of trained inmate caregivers and an early childhood specialist. Evaluations of some of these services have indicated that they are doing an excellent job in providing services to this target population.

AB  - Since 2003, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada has seen an alarming rise in infectious syphilis cases among mainly heterosexual persons. In response to this outbreak, a peer-based outreach program called Women in the Shadows (WIS) was designed and implemented in April 2008. In this manuscript, we highlight key findings from the qualitative evaluation of the WIS program, focusing primarily on the women's experiences of homelessness and with accessing the program. Twelve street-involved women who were pregnant, or believed they might be pregnant and seven program staff participated in in-depth, individual interviews. Participants experienced tremendous challenges in day-to-day survival and in their efforts to transition out of a street lifestyle. Both WIS staff and clients believed that obtaining appropriate housing was essential for any lifestyle change, yet posed one of the greatest challenges. The WIS program enabled the women to access non-medical support and services, in addition to providing pregnant street-involved women non-judgemental medical care. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Depuis 2003, Edmonton, Alberta, le Canada a connu une augmentation alarmante des cas de syphilis infectieuse chez les personnes principalement hétérosexuels. En réponse à cette épidémie, un programme basé sur les pairs de sensibilisation intitulé Women in the Shadows (WIS) a été conçu et mis en œuvre en Avril 2008. Dans ce manuscrit, nous présentons les résultats principaux de l'évaluation qualitative du programme WIS, en se concentrant principalement sur les expériences des femmes sans-abris et de l'accès au programme. Douze femmes de la rue qui étaient enceintes ou croyaient être enceintes et sept employées du programme ont participés dans des profondes entrevues individuelles. Les participants ont éprouvé d'énormes défis de vie quotidienne et dans leurs efforts dans la transition de s'échapper d'une mode de vie de rue. Tant le personnel et les clients WIS croient que l'obtention d'un logement adéquat est essentiel pour tout changement de style de vie, et a posé l'un des plus grands défis. Le programme WIS a permis aux femmes d'accéder le soutien et services non médicaux, en plus de fournir femmes enceintes de la rue des soins médicaux sans jugement.

AB  - 'Co-occurring disorders' denotes the simultaneous diagnosis of a substance use disorder and a serious mental illness. Co-occurring disorders can occur in any combination and number. Women with co-occurring disorders were more likely to receive mental health services compared with men. Women with co-occurring disorders can be difficult to engage, successfully treat, and retain in treatment. Psychotropic medications are now considered a vital aspect of treatment for many people with co-occurring disorders. Women with co-occurring disorders bring many challenges to treatment. Empirical studies have shown that programs that incorporate at least nine elements, including: a long-term approach to recovery, integrated mental health and substance abuse treatment, comprehensive focus, stagewise treatment, motivational interventions, attention to women's relationships, assertive outreach, and cognitive-behavioral interventions are associated with positive treatment outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To describe the current use of health services by the street-based female sex workers (FSWs) and to explore beliefs behind these health behaviors. Study setting: Community outreach approach in a few red-light districts in Hong Kong. Study design: A 30 min face-to-face interview was carried out in 89 women by direct approach and snowballing, followed by a focus group discussion drawn from the participants of the questionnaire. Results: While these FSWs' perception of personal health was good, a considerable proportion suffered from illnesses but the consultation rate was a third of the mean rate of the general population in Hong Kong. Many street workers experienced difficulty in utilizing health service in Hong Kong and even when they did, it was mainly for acute problems. Affordable access to health public services was excluded and many found private services unaffordable due to the high price charged by the practitioners. It was common for these women to self-medicate, delay in seeking medical help, or travel back to China for treatment. Conclusion: The current empirical understanding of the health and health service utilization by sex workers is unbalanced. In order to reduce sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV among the street sex workers, it is essential to address the fundamental issue of health care access.

AB  - Background: The Responsive Interdisciplinary Child-Community Health Education and Research (RICHER) initiative is an intersectoral and interdisciplinary community outreach primary health care (PHC) model. It is being undertaken in partnership with community based organizations in order to address identified gaps in the continuum of health services delivery for `at risk' children and their families. As part of a larger study, this paper reports on whether the RICHER initiative is associated with increased: 1) access to health care for children and families with multiple forms of disadvantage and 2) patient-reported empowerment. This study provides the first examination of a model of delivering PHC, using a Social Paediatrics approach. Methods: This was a mixed-methods study, using quantitative and qualitative approaches; it was undertaken in partnership with the community, both organizations and individual providers. Descriptive statistics, including logistic regression of patient survey data (n=86) and thematic analyses of patient interview data (n=7) were analyzed to examine the association between patient experiences with the RICHER initiative and parent-reported empowerment. Results: Respondents found communication with the provider clear, that the provider explained any test results in a way they could understand, and that the provider was compassionate and respectful. Analysis of the survey and in-depth interview data provide evidence that interpersonal communication, particularly the provider's interpersonal style (e. g., being treated as an equal), was very important. Even after controlling for parents' education and ethnicity, the provider's interpersonal style remained positively associated with parent-reported empowerment (p<0.01). Conclusions: This model of PHC delivery is unique in its purposeful and required partnerships between health care providers and community members. This study provides beginning evidence that RICHER can better meet the health and health care needs of people, especially those who are vulnerable due to multiple intersecting social determinants of health. Positive interpersonal communication from providers can play a key role in facilitating situations where individuals have an opportunity to experience success in managing their and their family's health.

AB  - Purpose : The purpose of this paper is to critically discuss state inaction on and NGO responses to the hidden problem of youth disengagement in the form of social withdrawal. Design/methodology/approach : The study is based on data drawn from six focus groups of social workers working with youths experiencing the problem of social withdrawal and another 30 individual interviews with service users having had this vulnerable background. Findings : Substantiated with empirical findings, the paper argues that young people in social withdrawal characterized by their socially avoidant behavior and deprivation of an engagement status as a worker, student or trainee are largely invisible to the state because of the latter's insensitivity to the heterogeneity and diversity of disengaged youth and reproduction of the anti-social notion of at-risk youth. A flexible and tailor-made strategy initiated by an NGO is argued to be more effective in meeting the needs of silently-disengaged young people. Originality/value : This paper critically examines state inaction on the problem of youth disengagement in the form of social withdrawal and argues the importance of adopting a flexible and tailor-made strategy with regard to both outreaching and service provision efforts.

AB  - Objectives: This study evaluated a culturally attuned cognitive–behavior intervention for reducing impulsivity and delinquency-related attitudes and behaviors among Chinese delinquent youth in Hong Kong. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was adopted. Twenty participants received CBI, and 20 received routine counseling for a period of 12 months. All participants filled out a standardized questionnaire before the intervention and at 6 and 12 months of intervention. Results: A series of 2 × 3 analyses of variance were used to examine the Time × Group Effects of the two groups of participants. Results suggested, when compared to the control group, the participants in the experimental group showed greater and continuous positive changes in overall impulsivity, nonplanning impulsivity, cognitive impulsivity, and overall delinquency, with effect sizes showing moderate to large magnitude of change. Conclusion: This culturally attuned CBI program may be a useful inclusion in the outreaching social services for Chinese delinquent youth in Hong Kong.

AB  - Findings from more than 30 studies reported that community-based outreach was an effective strategy for reaching drug-using populations and providing them with the means for behavior change. Of those drug users who participated in community-based outreach interventions, a significant number entered treatment for their drug addiction. This model had been found to be effective with multiracial, multiethnic, male and female, HIV seropositive and seronegative, infected and non-infected drug-using populations residing in areas with low, medium, and high HIV prevalence. This model featured community-based outreach as a primary vehicle for accessing out-of-treatment drug users at risk and eliciting their commitment to HIV/AIDS risk reduction, followed by two sessions of risk-reduction counseling and education. The sessions were organized to include optional testing and pre-and post-test counseling for HIV and other blood-borne infections. Intervention activities drew on principles of HIV prevention for drug-using populations, communications theory about credible messengers, and health behavior theory about perceptions of personal vulnerability. In addition to accessing drug users in a variety of community settings, outreach workers served as role models, educators, and advocates who could provide drug users with changing and accurate risk-reduction information in settings that were familiar to them and at times of greatest risk. Community outreach workers could advocate protective behaviors such as continuing drug use, using sterile syringes, disinfecting injection equipment, and using condoms among at-risk populations.

AB  - The information in this manual will help community planners, policymakers, and service providers develop and implement programs to better prevent HIV and other blood-borne infections. Findings from more than 30 studies report that community-based outreach is an effective strategy for reaching the drug-using population and for providing them with the means of a behavior change. The model represents community-based outreach as a primary vehicle for accessing out-of-treatment drug users at risk and eliciting their commitments to HIV/AIDS risk reduction, followed by two sessions of risk-reduction counseling and education. Since the model was designed and tested nationally, it can adapt readily to the specific characteristics and needs of any community. Section 1 presents background information on the development of the model. Section 2 outlines the step-by-step procedures for community outreach and personal risk assessment and reduction. Section 3 discusses implementation issues, including training and supervision. (Contains 4 appendixes and 20 references.) (JDM)

AB  - Introduction: Whilst research demonstrates the benefits of critical care outreach, limited research describes staffs’ perspective of these teams. Objective: This study examined ward nurses’ and doctors’ perceptions of the service provided by a nurse-led 24hours a day, seven days a week Patient at Risk team. Design: Using an exploratory survey research design and a previously used instrument, data were collected between January and March (2016). The instruments’ reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha (a = 0.90). Results: 339 participants, including 255 nurses and 84 doctors, completed the questionnaire (70.48% response rate). Most participants agreed the Patient at Risk team 1) were accessible and approachable, 2) recognised deterioration and reduced serious events, 3) provided ward staff teaching and coaching and 4) aided allied health referral and improved transfer of patients from critical care. More nurses than doctors perceived the team’s role more positively in some aspects of the service they provided. Whilst most comments were positive, some comments identified improvements could be made to the service. Conclusion: Ward nurses’ and doctors’ perceived the Patient at Risk team contributed to improving care of deteriorating ward patients. The instrument used in this study may be useful to other outreach teams to identify service improvements. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Children who experience abuse and neglect are at risk for failure to thrive and may suffer consequences in their cognitive, behavioral, and social development. Because of exposure to maltreatment, some children may not have access to valuable social and recreational experiences as needed to enhance their cognitive, behavioral, and social development, and improve their overall quality of life. Research states that the intervention of an overnight or day-to-day recreational camp is an experience for children that has proven to be highly effective for children within the child welfare population. The purpose of this project was to write a grant proposal for a community outreach program that the YMCA of Greater Whittier will use to recruit and serve vulnerable youth at their recreational camp site, Camp Arbolado. Implications for social work practice are discussed. The submission for funding for this grant was not required for successful completion of this project.

While HIV testing uptake has been studied among key populations in India, limited information is available on multi-level barriers and facilitators to HIV testing, and experiences with free, publicly available testing services, among key populations. We conducted 12 focus groups (n = 84) and 12 key informant interviews to explore these topics among men who have sex with men, transgender women, cisgender female sex workers, and injecting drug users in the city of Chennai. We identified inter-related barriers at social-structural, health-care system, interpersonal, and individual levels. Barriers included HIV stigma, marginalised-group stigma, discrimination in health-care settings, including government testing centres, and fears of adverse social consequences of testing HIV positive. Facilitators included outreach programmes operated by community-based/non-governmental organisations, accurate HIV knowledge and risk perception for HIV, and access to drug dependence treatment for injecting drug users. Promoting HIV testing among these key populations requires interventions at several levels: reducing HIV-related and marginalised-group stigma, addressing the fears of consequences of testing, promoting pro-testing peer and social norms, providing options for rapid and non-blood-based HIV tests, and ensuring non-judgmental and culturally competent HIV counselling and testing services.

AB  - This paper gives an overview of the Anna Freud Centre's use of video as a clinical and a research tool with parents and young infants. The new digital technologies have implications for extending therapeutic technique in clinical work, and for evaluation of innovative work in applied settings. Video provides the technical means to observe, support and intervene in interactional processes that occur between mother and infant in earliest infancy and also allows research to focus on the mother–infant relationship. Parent–infant psychotherapy is an analytic treatment modality that aims to promote the parent–infant relationship in order to facilitate infant development. The clinical case example provided explores the use of digital video in work with parents and their twins in the Parent–Infant Project therapy room. Video as a research tool is illustrated by the evaluation of a couple of parent–infant psychotherapy outreach projects in a prison setting, and in a hostel for homeless families.

AB  - Ten models of adolescent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care were funded in 1993 by the Special Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program through the Ryan White CARE Act. These models were supported to advance knowledge about the engagement of HIV-positive & at-risk adolescents & young adults in care. An overview is provided of the SPNS Program's adolescent initiative, which developed & evaluated innovative models of HIV care, offering background information on & summarizing the 10 models of care. The models are organized into four groups emphasizing different concepts: (1) youth involvement; (2) outreach to bring youth into services; (3) case management & linkage to services; & (4) a comprehensive continuum of care for youth. 69 References.

AB  - Examined the gender-specific needs of and use of services by HIV-positive youth at Boston's HAPPENS (HIV Adolescent Provider and Peer Education Network for Services) program compared with negative and untested at-risk youth. Risk behavior and services use data were collected for 1,044 Ss (aged 12–24 yrs) who were homeless or HIV-positive, or using HIV counseling and testing services. Results show that HIV-positive Ss were 8 times as likely to use a range of medical services than others. HIV-positive females were more likely to report previous pregnancy or sex with high-risk partners than other females. HIV-positive males were more likely to be youth of color and report same-sex partners and substance use than were other males. It is concluded that by linking services to basic needs through outreach and drop-in centers, hard to reach populations such as HIV-positive youth can access medical services.

AB  - This study evaluates the factors associated with initiation of services in the Boston HAPPENS Program, which is a collaborative network of care consisting of multiservice outreach agencies, community health centers and hospitals, for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive and hard to reach youth who are 12-24 years old. The program served 2116 youth who were 19.8 ± 2.9 years old; 64% female; 45% youth of color; 16% gay/lesbian, bisexual, or undecided; and 10% homeless or runaway. At first contact with the program, 56% received outreach services; and 91% received a health intervention. Among those receiving a health intervention, 55% had HIV counseling and testing services, 49% medical care, 24% case management, and 9% mental health services. HIV-positive youth needed more contacts before a first medical visit than those who were HIV-negative or untested (p < 0.001). Different kinds of service sites reached different populations of at-risk youth. Logistic regression modeling showed that for young women, older age, lesbian-bisexual orientation, substance use, high-risk sexual behaviors, and receiving outreach services at first contact were independent predictors of initiation of services at outreach agencies; however, unprotected sex with males, and pregnancy were associated with a greater likelihood of care at hospitals or community health centers. For young men, older age, Asian/other ethnicity, and substance abuse were associated with care at outreach agencies; however, positive HIV status and unprotected sex with females were associated with care at hospitals or community health centers. Comprehensive networks of care offering a continuum of services and a variety of entry routes and types of care sites are needed to connect underserved youth to health care.

AB  - Because of the large number of individuals at risk for HIV infection who visit gay saunas and sex clubs, these venues are useful settings in which to offer HIV outreach programmes for voluntary counselling and testing (VCT). Nevertheless, establishing a successful VCT programme in such a setting can be a daunting challenge, in large part because there are many barriers to managing the various components likely to be involved. Using qualitative data from a process evaluation of a new VCT programme at a gay sauna in California, USA, we describe how the various stakeholders overcame barriers of disparate interests and responsibilities to work together to successfully facilitate a regular and frequent on-site VCT programme that was fully utilized by patrons.

AB  - In recent decades, law enforcement and education leaders have been dealing with in school behaviors of youth that often result in children receiving involvement with the police instead of conferences with the parents. This study examined the detailed analysis of the secondary data gathered from the Teen Outreach Program to determine the impact of the service oriented actions provided to African American males. In addition, this study sought to determine if such service oriented actions impacted school suspensions. School suspensions have become more than an educational issue and there is a clear and pressing indication of their relationship to criminal justice and criminology; primarily resulting from the fact that school suspensions result mainly from deviant acts. The findings of this study showed that males participating in activities that serve as a deterrent from the school to prison pipeline are not hindered by the family type, grades, and race, but instead they are able to successfully complete their course work.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of vulnerable women about the value of intensive home visiting in pregnancy and the first year of life delivered by health visitors trained to work in partnership with families. Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with women who had completed the home visiting programme and agreed to be interviewed. The data were fully transcribed and analysed thematically. Despite initial concerns and negative preconceptions about health and social service professionals, participating women greatly valued the relationships that were established with their home visitors and identified a number of ways in which they had benefited. These included increased confidence, improved mental health, better parenting, improved relationships and changes in their attitudes toward professionals. These findings demonstrate the potential of intensive home visiting delivered in partnership with mothers in reaching and helping vulnerable and hard-to-reach families. They highlight the importance of establishing a trusting relationship between helper and provider, and the need for home visitors to have the necessary skills and qualities to establish such relationships.

AB  - The Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act authorizes the use of community-based organizations of proven effectiveness, such as Opportunities Industrialization Centers of America (OIC), to be involved in improving the overall vocational education delivery system. State assistance for vocational education support by community-based organizations is one of five special programs authorized by Title III of the Act. The Act encourages eligible recipients who are operating vocational education programs to develop relationships with community-based organizations. The Act requires each community-based organization that wants assistance under Title III to submit jointly with the appropriate eligible recipient a specified application to the state board. States will provide financial assistance to joint projects of community-based organizations within the state that provide the following special vocational education services and activities: outreach programs, prevocational educational preparation and basic skills development, special prevocational programs targeted to disadvantaged youth, career intern programs, student needs assessment, and guidance and counseling. Because of financial constraints and a shift in educational emphasis arising from the "A Nation at Risk" report, community-based organizations such as OIC will probably have more opportunity to be involved in vocational education in the future.

AB  - This guide provides parents, educators, and other adults with tools and strategies to engage in constructive discussions and activities about the causes and effects of prejudice and bias-motivated behavior and to intervene when needed with children who engage in such behavior. Though it targets elementary school, much of the material is relevant to preschool, youth services, law enforcement, and other community workers. It helps increase awareness of the problem of bias crime and shares information about promising education and counteraction strategies. Seven sections examine the following: (1) "Introduction to This Guide" (philosophy, audience, contents, and recommendations); (2) "Background Information" (e.g., definition of hate crimes and bias incidents and bullying in schools); (3) "Interacting with Children on Issues of Diversity and Bias" (e.g., how children develop racial and cutural identity and attitudes and the role of parents and families); (4) "Proactive Tools and Strategies to Help Children Resist Prejudice and Hate" (promising practices, programs, and activities); (5) "Guidelines for Intervention and Outreach" (e.g., the responsibility of school personnel and the role of law enforcement); (6) "Bibliographies" (e.g., resources for personal and professional development, for educators and youth service professionals, and parents and families); and (7) "References." (Contains 33 references.) (SM)

AB  - BACKGROUND For decades, the campus security offices at some colleges and universities for decades have submitted crime statistics to the FBI as part of the UCR program. Since 1974 (cf. Unfortunately, these statistics are of limited use for instructional purposes because (1) in any given year, only between 300 to 340 schools (or less than 10% of approximately 3,500 colleges and universities nationwide) report to the FBI (Castelli 1990; Purdum 1988), and (2) the FBI only includes serious, index offenses (homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor-vehicle theft, arson, and larcenytheft), and does not include nonindex crimes based on actual arrests (for such typical campus offenses as drug abuse violations, drunkenness and liquor law violations, and vandalism), in its reports (Federal Bureau of Investigation 1995:157-66). [...]some of the many primary sources criticizing police statistics are Black (1970), Kitsuse and Cicourel (1963), Savitz (1978), and Skogan (1974); more favorable assessments of the UCR include Gove, Hughes, and Geerken (1985) and Hindelang, Hirschi, and Weis (1979). Interestingly, student services administrators and campus security officials nationwide have expressed skepticism about the low incidence of reported rapes (N-K Collison 1993; Ornstein 1994; Palmer 1993); some even note cynically that campuses with the best outreach programs (crisis hotlines and counseling centers) to assist the victims of acquaintance and date rape ironically are the ones penalized with the highest reported incidence (Lederman 1993; Palmer 1993; Stormer 1990).

AB  - Many YouthBuild programs have been started largely with local and private funds, but most have also obtained substantial support from different Federal agencies. Tips on seeking Federal funding are offered to help YouthBuild organizations identify programs that meet their needs. Federal programs most frequently used by YouthBuild programs are listed, and new or special funding sources are identified. Specific funding sources within the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Health and Human Services are described. Funding available from government-sponsored enterprises and other miscellaneous agencies is also noted. YouthBuild programs are examined that focus on such areas as job training and job opportunities, community development, assistance for homeless persons, drug-free schools, opportunities for out-of-school youth, juvenile gangs, juvenile drug abuse, community outreach, and runaway and homeless youth, Appendixes contain information on the Federal budget process, a glossary, a list of local directors of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and a list of community investment officers of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.

AB  - Addresses the issues of substance abuse in the African American community and provides a brief overview of the historical background, cultural norms and values, and the connection between substance abuse and racism, White privilege, oppression, poverty, and sexism. Patterns of substance use and abuse for women, adolescents, lesbians, and gay men, and implications for treatment, prevention, and research are discussed. Current issues affecting the use of substances also include the 'double consciousness' of being Black in a White society, the lack of positive role models, advertising, and the ideology of conspiracy. The author argues that treatment and prevention programs must ensure that services are accessible to the African American community via flexible hours, outreach services, and an approach that considers the total individual and his or her life circumstances, i.e., addressing areas outside the traditional substance abuse arena, such as housing, employment, child care, and other health concerns.

AB  - Background Homelessness affects many people in contemporary society with consequences for individuals and the wider community. Homeless people experience poorer levels of general physical and mental health than the general population and there is a substantial international evidence base which documents multiple morbidity. Despite this, they often have problems in obtaining suitable health care. Aim To critically examine the international literature pertaining to the health care of homeless people and discuss the effectiveness of treatment interventions. Design of study Review and synthesis of current evidence. Method Medline (1966-2003), EMBASE (1980-2003), PsycINFO (1985-2003), CINAHL (1982-2003), Web of Science (1981-2003) and the Cochrane Library (Evidence Based Health) databases were reviewed using key terms relating to homelessness, intervention studies, drug misuse, alcohol misuse and mental health. The review was not limited to publications in English. It included searching the internet using key terms, and grey literature was also accessed through discussion with experts. Results Internationally, there are differing models and services aimed at providing health care for homeless people. Effective interventions for drug dependence include adequate oral opiate maintenance therapy, hepatitis A, B and tetanus immunisation, safer injecting advice and access to needle exchange programmes. There is emerging evidence for the effectiveness of supervised injecting rooms for homeless injecting drug users and for the peer distribution of take home naloxone in reducing drug-related deaths. There is some evidence that assertive outreach programmes for those with mental ill health, supportive programmes to aid those with motivation to address alcohol dependence and informal programmes to promote sexual health can lead to lasting health gain. Conclusions As multiple morbidity is common among homeless people, accessible and available primary health care is a pre-requisite for effective health interventions. This requires addressing barriers to provision and multi-agency working so that homeless people can access the full range of health and social care services. There are examples of best practice in the treatment and retention of homeless people in health and social care and such models can inform future provision.

AB  - This cross-sectional study examined risk and asset factors thought to be associated with fighting among a sample of 1,642 African American children and adolescents in a central Alabama school district. Results show that poor grades, parental abuse, and gang affiliation were significant risk factors associated with higher frequency of fighting. Results also show that parental monitoring and being happy at school were associated with lower frequency of fighting, suggesting the importance of continued support for outreach to parents and further efforts to reduce or eliminate the community factors that promote proliferation of gangs. Programs, either for an entire community or a school system within a community, must be sensitive to the specific risks, assets, and outcomes of that environment so that prevention and intervention are sensitive to cultural, environmental, and demographic distinctions in target populations.

AB  - Background: Methamphetamine (MA) use during pregnancy is associated with many pregnancy complications, including preterm birth, small for gestational age, preeclampsia, and abruption. Hawaii has lead the nation in MA use for many years, yet prior to 2007, did not have a comprehensive plan to care for pregnant substance-using women. In 2006, the Hawaii State Legislature funded a pilot perinatal addiction clinic. The Perinatal Addiction Treatment Clinic of Hawaii was built on a harm-reduction model, encompassing perinatal care, transportation, child-care, social services, family planning, motivational incentives, and addiction medicine. We present the implementation model and results from our first one hundred three infants (103) seen over 3 years of operation of the program. Methods: Referrals came from community health centers, hospitals, addiction treatment facilities, private physician offices, homeless outreach services and self-referral through word-of-mouth and bus ads. Data to describe sample characteristics and outcome was obtained prospectively and retrospectively from chart abstraction and delivery data. Drug use data was obtained from the women’s self-report and random urine toxicology during the pregnancy, as well as urine toxicology at the time of birth on mothers, and urine and meconium toxicology on the infants. Post-partum depression was measured in mothers with the Edinburgh Post-Partum depression scale. Data from Path clinic patients were compared with a representative cohort of women delivering at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children during the same time frame, who were enrolled in another study of pregnancy outcomes. Ethical approval for this study was obtained through the University of Hawaii Committee for Human Studies. Results: Between April 2007 and August 2010, 213 women with a past or present history of addiction were seen, 132 were pregnant and 97 delivered during that time. 103 live-born infants were delivered. There were 3 firsttrimester Spontaneous Abortions, two 28-week intrauterine fetal deaths, and two sets of twins and 4 repeat pregnancies. Over 50% of the women had lost custody of previous children due to substance use. The majority of women who delivered used methamphetamine (86%), either in the year before pregnancy or during pregnancy. Other drugs include marijuana (59.8%), cocaine (33%), opiates (9.6%), and alcohol (15.2%). Of the women served, 85% smoked cigarettes upon enrollment. Of the 97 women delivered during this period, all but 4 (96%) had negative urine toxicology at the time of delivery. Of the 103 infants, 13 (12.6%) were born preterm, equal to the state and national average, despite having many risk factors for prematurity, including poverty, poor diet, smoking and polysubstance use. Overwhelmingly, the women are parenting their children, > 90% retained custody at 8 weeks. Long-term follow-up showed that women who maintained custody chose long-acting contraceptive methods; while those who lost custody had a very high (> 50%) repeat pregnancy rate at 9 months post delivery.

AB  - Conducted a cost analysis at 8 sites that provide outreach services to 2 populations at high risk for HIV infection: injection drug users and street youth. Questionnaires were completed by 21 programs associated with the 8 sites. The potential benefit of HIV prevention through outreach services was assessed by comparing outreach costs with the medical costs of treating an HIV infected individual. The average cost of outreach services was $13.30 per contact. The cost per contact for services to street youth was 78% higher than for drug users. Comparing the cost per contact with HIV treatment costs, if only 2 in 10,000 contacts reduce their high-risk behavior so as to avoid transmission of HIV, outreach would yield a net benefit. These results provide evidence that outreach programs compare favorably with other HIV prevention strategies in terms of cost. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Amendments Act of 2007 granted the FDA new authorities to enhance drug safety by requiring application holders to submit a proposed Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). A REMS is a required risk management plan that uses tools beyond the package insert. REMS elements may include a medication guide and patient package insert for patients and a communication plan focused on health care professionals. Elements to assure safe use (ETASUs) are put in place to mitigate a specific known serious risk when other less restrictive elements of a REMS are not sufficient to mitigate such risk. An implementation system is required for an REMS that includes the ETASUs. With approximately eight years of experience with REMS programs, many health care settings have created systems to manage REMS and also to integrate REMS into their practice settings. At the same time, there are issues associated with the development and implementation of REMS. In 2011, FDA created the REMS Integration Initiative to develop guidance on how to apply statutory criteria to determine when a REMS is required, to improve standardization and assessment of REMS, and to improve integration of REMS into the existing healthcare system. A key component of the REMS Integration Initiative is stakeholder outreach to better understand how existing REMS programs are working and to identify opportunities for improvement. This review attempts to share our company’s experience with the REMS program, and to provide updates on FDA’s efforts to improve REMS communication, to standardize REMS process, to reduce REMS program burdens and to build a common REMS platform.

AB  - Despite a legally-mandated right to shelter and extensive outreach efforts, an estimated 3,675 homeless individuals were living on the streets of New York City in 2018. Through interviews with 43 unsheltered homeless individuals in the borough of Manhattan (age range 21–74 years), this qualitative study examined barriers they face in accessing housing and other services as well as experiences surviving on the street. Through thematic analysis of the interview data, the most common barriers found were obtaining required identification documents, lack of accessibility of shelters amid complex healthcare needs, waiting as part of the process, and exclusion of pets from shelters and housing options. Themes capturing survival on the street included sleeping safe, avoiding shelters, and meeting daily needs. Virtually all barriers street homeless New Yorkers face stem from bureaucratic policies that, however well-intentioned, do not address their diverse needs. Thus, long delays and poor communication, combined with crowded, unsafe shelters, lead to frustration and alienation. While homelessness is ultimately the result of a severe and chronic shortage of affordable housing, creating accessible, safe, pet-friendly shelter and safe haven options and instituting a smoother, more transparent process for moving from the streets could substantially reduce street homelessness.

AB  - This article focuses on the place of youth work which is presented as a distinctive form of practice with young people complementing other approaches such as schooling or social work. In summarising the place of young people in contemporary Britain, it notes the particular pressures of poverty and unemployment on their lives. The main features of the New Labour and subsequently the Coalition governments' policies towards youth work are identified with particular reference to the consequences of recent austerity policies that have taken place from 2010 onwards. It offers suggestions on how youth work can be re-built.

AB  - This paper documents the evaluation of a 20-month project to provide voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) to a mobile population of youth surrounding the Agbogbloshie market in Accra, Ghana. The specific objectives of the evaluation were to determine: 1) to what extent targets for providing VCT services to the specified population were reached; 2) how HIV prevalence among clients compared to that of the general population; 3) to what extent former clients self-reported behaviour change; and 4) whether useful lessons could be drawn regarding fees, hours, and location of services, as well as use of peer educators to increase use of VCT services among the target population. Various methodologies, including questionnaires, focus group discussions, a review of the service statistics and an exit poll of clients were used to evaluate the project. The service statistics demonstrated that the project exceeded the life-of-project target for number of clients by nearly 40%. Prevalence for the VCT client population (aged 15-25) was higher than for the general population (aged 15-24), although the gender differentials were similar. Focus group data suggested that clients may have adopted behaviour changes as a result of VCT. Finally, focus group discussions and VCT service trends showed that the high number of clients was largely influenced by three factors: services being free, location and hours of services being convenient to the target population, and use of peer educators to promote the services. In addition, the evaluation highlighted the importance of the counselling component of VCT, even as counselling can get short-changed at the expense of HIV testing when large numbers of clients are involved. The evaluation stressed the need to appropriately remunerate peer educators for their work whenever possible. Finally, VCT programmes continue to face challenges such as: HIV stigma as a barrier to people coming to be counselled and tested; insufficient availability of medication, support and services for HIV-positive clients; and difficulty of ensuring the sustainability of VCT programmes.

AB  - Objectives: To assess risk behaviors for reproductive tract infections (RTI) including sexually transmitted infections (STI) among women who have sex with women (WSW) in Beijing, China. Methods: A cross-sectional study of women recruited from venues and internet outreach analyzed using interviews. Results: We recruited 224 WSW, among whom were 37 couples. The average age of participants was 25.6 years. Sex with men in the past year was reported by 10.7% of participants. During the past year, 34.3% (77/224) had had >1 sexual partner and 72.4% (162/224) had ever had >1 sexual partner. Condom use in the last sex with a man was reported by 54.2% (13/24) of women; 12.5% (3/24) reported never having used a condom with a man in the past year. In the past year, 13.4% (30/224) reported using sex toys with their female partners; of these, 43.3% (13/30) reported consistent condom use with the sex toys and 36.7% (11/30) had shared sex toys. Among participants 65.2% (120/184) reported that their "G-spot" had been stimulated during sex, 49.2% (59/120) of whom reported bleeding during or after sex. Only 12.5% (8/64) of those never reporting "G spot" stimulation reported bleeding during or after sex (P<0.001). Conclusions: WSW in Beijing engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors that may carry a substantial risk of being infected with STI/RTI. To implement STI/RTI prevention and intervention among women, women-women sexual behavior should be considered when doing research and intervention programs.

AB  - This qualitative study examines US Chinese older adults' views on the perceived effectiveness, challenges, and cultural adaptations of elder abuse interventions to psychological distress in the Chinese community in Chicago. A community-based participatory research approach was implemented to partner with the Chinese community. A total of 37 community-dwelling Chinese older adults (age 60+) participated in focus group discussions. Data analysis was based on grounded theory framework. Our findings suggest that older adults perceived social support, empowerment, and community-based interventions design as most effective to promote psychological well-being of victims. The perceived preferences were similar between elder abuse victims and non-victims. Strategies to culturally adapt evidence-based interventions were proposed with respect to nurturing filial piety values, familial integrations, and increased independence. Research and educational outreach initiatives were also discussed. This study has wide policy and practice implications for designing and deploying interventions to reduce psychological distress with respect to elder abuse outcome. Cultural relevancy of health interventions is important in the context of the Chinese communities. Collective federal, state, and community efforts are needed to support the culturally appropriate design and implementation of interventions suitable for the needs of the Chinese older adults.

AB  - The book is based on hundreds of the author's personal interviews with gangsters. Part 1 deals with the history and causal context of gangs, the realities of gang violence, and the dire consequences of the gang phenomenon. Part 2 analyzes various characteristics of contemporary gangs, and Part 3 presents traditional methods for preventing and controlling gang violence, including the therapeutic community approach that has proven successful in treating criminals/addicts and gangsters in prison and in the community. Part 4 reviews and analyzes notable gang theories and presents a projected plan for treating gangsters in a therapeutic community. The proposed treatment approaches are noted by the author to be the most important parts of the book. The section on treatment delineates a variety of interventions and approaches that have been effective and show promise for preventing and controlling gang violence. These include the enrichment of educational programs in the schools specially directed at gang-prone youths; family therapy; special job- training programs; special recreational and athletic facilities and programs in community centers; more vigorous outreach probation officers, with small caseloads, trained to understand gangs and resocialize at-risk youth; and the use of reformed former gangsters to direct gangsters into a positive lifestyle through therapeutic communities. A chapter on treating gangsters in a therapeutic community (TC) notes that a TC could use one of four possible organizational forms. One form is a standard community-based TC that houses and treats a variety of criminals/addicts. Another form is a special TC in the community that focuses only on the gangster problem. A third form is in a cellblock of a prison that deals with a variety of offenders, including violent gangsters. A fourth form is a special cellblock in a prison for core gangsters. Some of the treatment methods used in TCs are explained. Chapter notes and a subject index

AB  - The Magdalena Pilot Project provided outreach to Albuquerque women sex workers who were also using illicit drugs, primarily cocaine and heroin. This initial uncontrolled trial evaluated the feasibility and potential impact of motivational interviewing (MI) on change in drug use and HIV risk behaviors. Twenty-seven women were enrolled and interviewed about their substance use, health risk behaviors, and plans for change, using the client-centered, directive method of MI. Four months later, 25 women (93%) were interviewed again to assess their drug use and health risk behaviors. Large reductions were reported in frequency (days) of drug use and sex work, with a corresponding increase in days of lawful employment. In identifying problems that most needed to be addressed in order to help them live healthier lives, the women prioritized (1) basic needs including decent housing, (2) mental health care, and (3) treatment for substance use disorders.

AB  - Introduction: Transgender women may face the highest prevalence of HIV of any population, experiencing a disproportionate burden of disease frequently confirmed in surveys throughout the developing and developed world. However, few studies have been conducted specifically for transgender women in China. This study aimed to measure HIV prevalence and explore risk factors for infection in a diverse sample of Chinese transgender women to help advocate for prevention and care interventions for this population. Methods: From July 2018 to May 2019, we adapted a respondent‐driven sampling (RDS) approach to recruit a diverse sample of 250 transgender women through chains of peer referrals in two cities of eastern China, Nanjing and Suzhou. Eligible participants (i.e. 18 years of age or older, living in Jiangsu province and assigned male sex at birth but currently self‐identified as a gender different from male) completed a self‐administered questionnaire on a mobile phone to collect demographic characteristics and risk behaviours and underwent HIV testing. Results and discussion: The survey sample was young (82% under age 35 years), with 28.8% having a university degree, 39.2% reporting work at entertainment venues, 47.6% ever having taken hormones and 6.4% being diagnosed with an STI in the last year. One in five (20.8%) reported having engaged in sex work. HIV prevalence was 14.8% (95% CI 10.6 to 19.8), with 75.6% of those testing HIV positive reporting they were already aware of their serostatus. In multivariate analysis, HIV prevalence was significantly higher among transgender women above the age of 24 years, those who work at entertainment venues, who never have taken hormones, and who had been diagnosed with an STI in the last year. Conclusions: The prevalence of HIV among transgender women in our study, at 14.8%, is among the highest detected in any population in eastern China. Chinese transgender women may therefore follow the disparity in the burden of HIV noted worldwide. Data support policies to prioritize transgender women for HIV testing outreach, for in‐depth research to better understand the specific drivers of infection in this population, and for trans‐friendly HIV care and prevention programmes to address their specific needs.

AB  - Suicide and non-accidental poisoning are two important causes of death of female aborigines in Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of suicidal ideation and then to identify factors relating to this for female aborigines of childbearing age. Using stratified random sampling 212 female aborigines, aged between 20 and 49, were recruited into this study. Participants were interviewed at their homes by trained interviewers who used a structured questionnaire. The Suicidal Ideation Screening Questionnaire (SIS-Q) was used to help predict which participants would be more likely to have suicidal ideation. The prevalence rate of suicidal ideation within the previous 12 months was 20.3% (95% CI 14.9–25.7%). Significant related factors of suicidal ideation, which were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, revealed that women suffering depressive mood, living within a extended family, and perceiving poor health status were more likely to have suicidal ideation. Results generated from this study may be used, in primary care, for guidance as to how to prevent suicide.

AB  - Older adults with severe and persistent psychological difficulties can have trouble taking care of their basic needs, protecting themselves, and maintaining adequate housing. Traditional community mental health interventions, as well as almost all supportive services, are refused by this subgroup of elders. The project described in this article expands mental health services to older adults who, because of the severe nature of their psychological difficulties, are at risk of eviction, homelessness, premature institutionalization, premature guardianship, elder abuse including self-neglect, and decreased quality of life. The project utilizes psychological skills in personalized, flexible, time-intensive interventions that are delivered in community settings. Foundational to the interventions are careful clinician recruitment and established working relationships with community gatekeepers. Initial contacts include informal needs assessment and often require several hours per week. Ongoing clinical interventions are stepwise and may expand to include case management and traditional psychotherapy. Community consultation supports sustained interdisciplinary assistance to hard-to-serve elders. Outcomes included 508 persons served, of which 304 received long-term assistance. Positive changes included elders receiving services previously refused, decreasing isolation, avoiding eviction, reducing need for emergent services, decreasing delusional material, and setting limits in relationships. Ongoing issues such as burnout prevention and informed consent are addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Mental illnesses are often deemed low in health priority despite their large burden of disease. Because many chronic mental illnesses have early onset, youth present a high-risk cohort for disproportionate health burden. Stigma and literacy are two potential barriers to care, so pre-K to 12 schools offer an efficient platform for disseminating mental health promotion interventions. Integrated Science Education Outreach (InSciEd Out) is one such pre-K to 12 program that harnesses science education as an early intervention for disease behaviors. The thesis herein presents evaluation of a translational effort to address adolescent mental health from community to bench and back to the community again. Chapter I reviews the state of mental health and mental healthcare, with a focus upon interventions to address adolescent mental health and a discussion of the intersection between psychiatric and substance use disorders. Chapter II presents proof of concept of InSciEd Out's capacities in knowledge transfer, as measured through improved student science standardized testing post- InSciEd Out implementation. Chapter III extends science literacy gains to evaluate InSciEd Out-facilitated effects in alternative middle school students' mental health literacy, openness to share, and hypothetical mental health help-seeking behavioral intentions. Chapter IV investigates community-driven interest in the intersection between psychiatric conditions and nicotine addiction through identification of FDA-approved psychiatric drugs with potential repurposed efficacy in nicotine cessation. Chapter V summarizes research findings, discusses their significance and broader impact, and shares future directions in InSciEd Out's push toward improved mental health for all.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>Mental illness contributes substantially to global disease burden, particularly when illness onset occurs during youth and help-seeking is delayed and/or limited. Yet, few mental health promotion interventions target youth, particularly those with or at high risk of developing mental illness ("at-risk" youth). Community-based translational research has the capacity to identify and intervene upon barriers to positive health outcomes. This is especially important for integrated care in at-risk youth populations.<bold>Methods: </bold>Here the Integrated Science Education Outreach (InSciEd Out) program delivered a novel school-based anti-stigma intervention in mental health to a cohort of seventh and eighth grade at-risk students. These students were assessed for changes in mental health knowledge, stigmatization, and help-seeking intentions via a classroom activity, surveys, and teacher interviews. Descriptive statistics and Cohen's d effect sizes were employed to assess pre-post changes. Inferential statistical analyses were also conducted on pilot results to provide a benchmark to inform future studies.<bold>Results: </bold>Elimination of mental health misconceptions (substance weakness p = 0.00; recovery p = 0.05; prevention p = 0.05; violent p = 0.05) was accompanied by slight gains in mental health literacy (d = 0.18) and small to medium improvements in help-seeking intentions (anxiety d = 0.24; depression d = 0.48; substance d = 0.43; psychosis d = 0.53). Within this particular cohort of students, stigma was exceptionally low at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Teacher narratives revealed positive teacher views of programming, increased student openness to talk about mental illness, and higher peer and self-acceptance of mental health diagnoses and help-seeking.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Curricular-based efforts focused on mental illness in an alternative school setting are feasible and integrated well into general curricula under the InSciEd Out framework. Preliminary data suggest the existence of unique help-seeking barriers in at-risk youth. Increased focus upon community-based programming has potential to bridge gaps in translation, bringing this critical population to clinical care in pursuit of improved mental health for all.

AB  - The universal belief that poverty is a matter of low income and correctable through economic growth, more jobs, and increased income is precisely why poverty has persisted in the United States and elsewhere. We view the poor as those not yet in the middle class, but it can be shown that not all the poor can join the middle class, even in the richest country in the world. Through a project titled Rethinking Urban Poverty: Philadelphia Field Project, students and faculty at Pennsylvania State University, working together with community residents, have launched an effort to improve the quality of life in West Philadelphia. Traditionally, issues of poverty were dealt with through state welfare programs and corporate jobs. In contrast, the Penn State approach emphasizes the household economy, focusing on improving quality of life, reducing the cost of living, and creating jobs that cater to the everyday needs of household members.

AB  - WHILE THE ESCAMBIA CENTER DRUG ABUSE PROGRAM SERVES ALL AGES, THIS REPORT GIVES PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THOSE ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM MOST OFTEN USED WITH JUVENILES. THE PROGRAM OFFERS A 24-HOUR, 7-DAY-A-WEEK TELEPHONE COUNSELING AND REFERRAL SERVICE WHICH PROVIDES CRISIS INTERVENTION, REFERRAL TO APPROPRIATE AGENCIES, AND GENERAL COMMUNITY INFORMATION. CLIENTS COMING INTO THE PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME ARE GIVEN AN INTAKE EVALUATION BY TRAINED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, AND IF THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT THE CLIENT HAS NEED OF ANY OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE, A BROAD TREATMENT PLAN IS DEVELOPED, WITH CLIENT INVOLVEMENT IN THE DECISIONS. TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE DETOXIFICATION, OUTPATIENT SERVICES, LONG-TERM RESIDENTIAL CARE (ALONG THE LINES OF A THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY), A HALFWAY HOUSE, AND A BEHAVIORALLY ORIENTED DAY TREATMENT PROGRAM. EACH OF THESE TREATMENTS IS BRIEFLY DESCRIBED. JUVENILE OFFENDERS MAY USE ANY OF THE SERVICES MENTIONED, DEPENDING ON INTAKE DECISIONS. DUE TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN FLORIDA, THERE ARE FOUR PRIMARY REFERRAL SOURCES FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS CONTACTING THE PROGRAM: THE DIVISION OF YOUTH SERVICES PRIOR TO ANY ADJUDICATION, A JUDGE AFTER ADJUDICATION AS AN ASPECT OF SENTENCING, AN AFTERCARE COUNSELOR, AND THE CLIENT HIMSELF OR HIS PARENTS. THE DRUG ABUSE PROGRAM HAS ONE STAFF MEMBER WHOSE PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO BE A LIAISON WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ALL ITS LOCAL COMPONENTS. TWO OUTREACH WORKERS UNDER THIS STAFF MEMBER CONDUCT JAIL INTERVIEWS, WORK WITH THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE FOR PRETRIAL DIVERSION, GO TO COURT WITH CLIENTS ALREADY IN THE PROGRAM, AND COMMUNICATE WITH THOSE ALREADY SERVING TIME IN LOCAL COUNTY WORK CAMPS ABOUT THE SERVICES OFFERED BY THE PROGRAM.

AB  - The hospital's program has five major components: networking and consolidation, outreach, short-term crisis shelter, comprehensive medical and psychosocial care, and long-term shelter and case management. More than 30 county agencies have been organized into a Coordinating Council for Homeless Youth Services. Street outreach workers frequent areas where kids congregate and pass out cards with phone numbers and addresses of free services available to them. Some agencies operate hotlines or drop-in centers where clothing, food, and bus tokens are distributed and services such as access to showers, laundry facilities, and crisis counseling are offered. The short-term crisis shelter network includes a total of 84 beds; youth in crisis shelters receive food, showers, and crisis intervention counseling. Youth clinics provide outpatient medical care, mental health and substance abuse screening and counseling, and social needs assessment. The Los Angeles Youth Network operates a 20-bed shelter and a comprehensive case management center which provide emergency services, crisis intervention, long-term stabilization, and followup. Law enforcement in Los Angeles County plays a critical role in the system of care by locating youth and transporting them to an emergency shelter. 5 endnotes and 2 tables.

AB  - The Los Angeles system of care has five major components: networking and consolidation, outreach, short-term crisis shelter, comprehensive medical and psychosocial care, and long-term shelter and case management. The approach is collaborative, with a substantial portion of the work subcontracted to other youth agencies in the community in order to build and strengthen the network of existing services. In the process, the Los Angeles system has moved closer to developing a comprehensive approach to care for homeless street youth throughout the county. Where programs previously operated in relative isolation, representatives from 40 private and public agencies now meet regularly at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles to discuss ways of improving services. Systematized data collection has helped all agencies involved understand how they can work together and has prompted additional funding for needed services. 4 references and 1 table

AB  - Background: Since 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been working to address the ongoing opioid epidemic through opioid-education initiatives, the development of risk calculators, and other risk stratification tools. One primary focus of VA efforts has been the distribution of rescue naloxone kits to veterans at greatest risk of opioid-related adverse events. The purpose of this project was to identify primary care veterans at highest risk for serious opioid-related adverse events using the Risk Index for Overdose and Serious Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (RIOSORD) and offer rescue naloxone kits by telephone-based outreach. RIOSORD is a risk-stratification tool developed and validated within the veteran population. Methods: Veterans identified at highest risk of overdose or opioid-related adverse effects were contacted by telephone or letter to offer to provide a rescue naloxone kit between November 1st, 2016 and February 1st, 2017. The primary outcome of the project was the percentage of patients contacted that agreed to a naloxone prescription. Secondary outcomes included comparative efficacy of phone versus letter contact and reasons for refusal of naloxone if the offer was declined. Results: Of 41 veterans targeted by this project, most were successfully reached by telephone within three attempts (92.7%, n = 38). Approximately two-thirds of those reached by telephone agreed to a prescription for rescue naloxone (n = 26, 63.4%). The veterans that requested rescue naloxone selected the nasal formulation (n = 17) over the intramuscular auto-injector (n = 9). Conclusions: This project demonstrated that telephone-based outreach can be one method of distributing rescue naloxone to a high-risk patient population without requiring an in-person visit to a provider.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, public attention has focused on the possibility that social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook are being widely used to sexually solicit underage youth, consequently increasing their vulnerability to sexual victimization. Beyond anecdotal accounts, however, whether victimization is more commonly reported in social networking sites is unknown. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: The Growing up With Media Survey is a national cross-sectional online survey of 1588 youth. Participants were 10- to 15-year-old youth who have used the Internet at least once in the last 6 months. The main outcome measures were unwanted sexual solicitation on the Internet, defined as unwanted requests to talk about sex, provide personal sexual information, and do something sexual, and Internet harassment, defined as rude or mean comments, or spreading of rumors. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of all of the youth reported an unwanted sexual solicitation online in the last year; 4% reported an incident on a social networking site specifically. Thirty-three percent reported an online harassment in the last year; 9% reported an incident on a social networking site specifically. Among targeted youth, solicitations were more commonly reported via instant messaging (43%) and in chat rooms (32%), and harassment was more commonly reported in instant messaging (55%) than through social networking sites (27% and 28%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Broad claims of victimization risk, at least defined as unwanted sexual solicitation or harassment, associated with social networking sites do not seem justified. Prevention efforts may have a greater impact if they focus on the psychosocial problems of youth instead of a specific Internet application, including funding for online youth outreach programs, school antibullying programs, and online mental health services.

AB  - Background: There has been a notable expansion in routine health care in sub-Saharan Africa. While heath care is nominally free in many contexts, the time required to access services reflects an opportunity cost that may be substantial and highly gendered, reflecting the gendered nature of health care guidelines and patterns of use. The time costs of health care use, however, have rarely been systematically assessed at the population-level. Methods: Data come from the 2015 wave of a population-based cohort study of young adults in southern Malawi during which 1,453 women and 407 men between the ages of 21 and 31 were interviewed. We calculated the time spent seeking health care over a two-month period, disaggregating findings by men, recently-pregnant women, mothers with children under two years old, and “other women”. We then extrapolated the time required for specific services to estimate the time that would be needed for each subpopulation to meet government recommendations for routine health services over the course of a year. Results: Approximately 60% of women and 22% of men attended at least one health care visit during the preceding two months. Women spent six times as long seeking care as did men (t = -4.414, p<0.001), with an average 6.4 hours seeking care over a two-month period compared to 1 hour for men. In order to meet government recommendations for routine health services, HIV-negative women would need to spend between 19 and 63 hours annually seeking health care compared to only three hours for men. An additional 40 hours would be required of HIV-positive individuals initiating antiretroviral care. Conclusions: Women in Malawi spend a considerable amount of time seeking routine health care services, while men spend almost none. The substantial time women spend seeking health care exacerbates their time poverty and constrains opportunities for other meaningful activities. At the same time, few health care guidelines pertain to men who thus have little interaction with the health care system. Additional public health strategies such as integration of services for those services frequently used by women and specific guidelines and outreach for men are urgently needed.

AB  - Background: Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of HIV care and treatment programs is impacted by losses to follow-up (LTFU) in the patient population. The severity of this effect is undeniable but its extent unknown. Tracing all lost patients addresses this but census methods are not feasible in programs involving rapid scale-up of HIV treatment in the developing world. Sampling-based approaches and statistical adjustment are the only scaleable methods permitting accurate estimation of M&E indices. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a large antiretroviral therapy (ART) program in western Kenya, we assessed the impact of LTFU on estimating patient mortality among 8,977 adult clients of whom, 3,624 were LTFU. Overall, dropouts were more likely male (36.8% versus 33.7%; p = 0.003), and younger than non-dropouts (35.3 versus 35.7 years old; p = 0.020), with lower median CD4 count at enrollment (160 versus 189 cells/ml; p,0.001) and WHO stage 3-4 disease (47.5% versus 41.1%; p,0.001). Urban clinic clients were 75.0% of non-dropouts but 70.3% of dropouts (p,0.001). Of the 3,624 dropouts, 1,143 were sought and 621 had their vital status ascertained. Statistical techniques were used to adjust mortality estimates based on information obtained from located LTFU patients. Observed mortality estimates one year after enrollment were 1.7% (95% CI 1.3%-2.0%), revised to 2.8% (2.3%-3.1%) when deaths discovered through outreach were added and adjusted to 9.2% (7.8%-10.6%) and 9.9% (8.4%-11.5%) through statistical modeling depending on the method used. The estimates 12 months after ART initiation were 1.7% (1.3%-2.2%), 3.4% (2.9%-4.0%), 10.5% (8.7%-12.3%) and 10.7% (8.9%-12.6%) respectively. Conclusions/Significance Abstract: Assessment of the impact of LTFU is critical in program M&E as estimated mortality based on passive monitoring may underestimate true mortality by up to 80%. This bias can be ameliorated by tracing a sample of dropouts and statistically adjust the mortality estimates to properly evaluate and guide large HIV care and treatment programs.

AB  - THE POTENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF CITIZEN CRIME PREVENTION (CCP) ACTIVITIES IS BASED IN PART ON NEGATIVE RESULTS OF ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES. A BASIC ELEMENT OF CCP IS SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN MAINTAINING NEIGHBORHOOD DEFENSE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STIMULATE AS MUCH CASUAL AND PUBLIC SURVEILLANCE AS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, CCP ACTIVITIES NEED NOT BE CARRIED OUT IN COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, BUT, IN FACT, THEIR SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON INTERACTION WITH POLICE. IF SUCH A COOPERATIVE SYSTEM OCCURS, THEN THE FORMAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A COMPENSATORY SYSTEM, NEEDED WHEN INFORMAL SOCIAL CONTROLS FAIL. TYPES OF CCP ACTIVITIES INCLUDE BLOCK SECURITY PROGRAMS, BLOCK WATCHER AND NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY RADIO PROGRAMS, CITIZEN VOLUNTEER PROGRAMS, COMMUNITY RADIO WATCH, COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICERS, ESCORT SERVICES, HOME SECURITY, IMPROVED ALARM SYSTEMS, POLICE-COMMUNITY COUNCILS, POLICE-COMMUNITY RELATIONS PROGRAMS, POLICE RESERVE UNITS, PROPERTY IDENTIFICATION, RESIDENT PATROLS, SECRET WITNESS PROGRAMS, SECURITY GUARDS, STREET LIGHTING, VIGILANTE GROUPS AND YOUTH PATROLS. THE PRECISE SUCCESS OF CCP PROGRAMS IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS; MOST EVALUATION STUDIES OF CCP LACK EMPIRICAL MEASUREMENT OF SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, CRIME PREVENTION AND ITS EVALUATION ARE COMPLEX. FIVE ELEMENTS OF CCP ACTIVITIES THAT MUST BE OPERATIONALLY DEFINED IN EVALUATION STUDIES CAN BE IDENTIFIED, HOWEVER. THEY ARE OUTREACH EFFORTS, ORGANIZATONAL FORM, RELATION TO THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS, AND THE ACTIVITIES THEMSELVES. NOTES ARE INCLUDED. (DEP)

AB  - Objective: This study investigated equity in enrollment in a Medicaid waiver program for early intensive behavioral intervention for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods: State administrative, Medicaid, and U.S. Census data for children enrolled in the waiver program between 2007 and 2015 (N = 2,111) were integrated. Multivariate and bivariate analyses were used to compare enrollees’ neighborhood demographic characteristics with those of the state’s general population, with controls for enrollees’ age, sex, and race-ethnicity. Results: Findings indicate that in general, enrollment was equitable. During the years in which there were inequities, children who lived in neighborhoods of privilege were favored. These neighborhoods had higher median incomes, lower poverty levels, and fewer female-headed households and were located in urban areas. Conclusions: As states work to provide equitable treatment to children with ASD and their families, it is important to track potential inequities between children who do and do not enroll in services and to use this information to inform outreach efforts. States may turn to South Carolina for insight on how to ensure equity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Sixty-two battered women who had accessed domestic violence services were asked to whom they disclosed the partner abuse, the responses they received, and how supported they felt by kin and nonkin network members. The findings showed that older women and those who had resided in the United States longer were more likely to make disclosures to kin members. Older women, those who had higher levels of perceived social support, and those who reported lower frequency of physical violence were more likely to disclose to nonkin members. The findings suggest that those women experiencing more severe abuse may be the least likely to disclose to others. As a group, the South Asian women were older and more educated, and greater proportions were or had been married to the abuser. In contrast to the other groups, a greater proportion reported having been burned or scalded and fewer reported being sexually coerced. In greater proportions, they disclosed the abuse to brothers and fathers and were advised to stay in their marriages. Service providers working with minority battered women must be knowledgeable of cross-cultural differences in the experience of abuse and disclosure patterns. Culturally appropriate and aggressive outreach within specific ethnic communities may be required to reach battered women in the community. Service providers must consider working with members of women's informal support network to provide both emotional and instrumental support.

AB  - Background: Theoretical and methodological research on risk-taking practices often frames risk as an individual choice. While risk does occur at individual level, it is determined by aspirations which are connected to others and society. For many displaced women globally, these aspirations are often linked to the well-being of their children and other household members. This article explores the links between aspirations for the future, gendered household dynamics, and health risk-taking behavior among the Rwandan urban refugee community. Methods: This analysis drew from participant observation, focus group discussions, and in-depth interviews with 49 male and 42 female household members from 36 Rwandan refugee households in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The fieldwork was conducted over 12 months between May–August 2016, May–August 2017, and February–August 2018. Results: We observed that while there was considerable convergence among household members in aspirations, there was considerable difference in risk-taking practices engaged to achieve them with women often assuming the greatest risks. These gendered realities of risk were not only related to structural concerns including access to different forms of capital, but also to socio-cultural gendered expectations of women, how risks were defined and justified, and household dynamics that drove the gendered reality of observed risk-behavior. Conclusions: Humanitarian programs and policies are distinctly finite in nature; focused on the short-term needs of persons affected by conflict. However, many humanitarian situations in the world are protracted. In the midst of these challenges, themes of future-orientation, possibilities, and shared aspirations for a better future emerge. These aspirations and the practices, including risk-taking practices that stem from them are central to understand if we are to ensure a just peace and stability in displaced communities throughout the developing world. Our analysis highlights the need to examine sociocultural dimensions related to hopes for the future, gender, and household dynamics as a way to understand risk behavior. We propose this can be done through a framework of precarious hope which we put forward in this paper, in which hope, agency, sociocultural and political economic contexts situate risk as a gendered practice of hope amidst constraint.

AB  - Education is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing poverty and inequality, and lays a foundation for sustained economic growth. Aboriginal peoples of Australia experience `overwhelming' disadvantages across every indicator of social and economic well being when compared with non-Aboriginal peoples. This disadvantage is experienced across all sectors of education, and although Aboriginal students are participating at high rates in vocational education and training, their pass rates and qualification outcomes remain well below those of non-Aboriginal Australians. This paper maps the participation and outcomes for Aboriginal desert dwellers in the vocational education and training sector and relates these to factors such as: (1) compulsory school access, (2) remote area labour markets, (3) the state of housing and infrastructure on discrete desert settlements, and (4) the policy and program initiatives influencing land tenure, income security and labour force status. The provision of education services across desert regions epitomises the tensions generated when the drivers of desert living - remoteness, dispersed sparse and mobile populations, variable climate, geography, cultures, languages and histories - interact with the differing factors that shape mainstream vocational education. Although innovations in program delivery more consistent with learner needs and aspirations can and do emerge, they are often framed as pilot projects or materialise in parallel program interventions such as youth work or land care. This paper explores the nature of these tensions and identifies the characteristics of educational interventions that can improve outcomes for Aboriginal desert dwellers no matter where they choose to live.

AB  - Based on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, this study explores theories of juvenile delinquency, juvenile delinquents, and rehabilitation as they are put into use in an American youth prison. Extended participant observation and interview produce accounts of how institutionalized theories takes shape in daily activities and interactions among incarcerated youth, staff members, and teachers. Participants in the study included 120 incarcerated young people and 44 adults. Findings illustrate the ways that prison school and rehabilitation programming sometimes make available and other times impede opportunities for the young people to gain access to activities that would position them as "regular kids." Implications of the study include an understanding of the impact of essentializing incarcerated young people as "juvenile delinquents" and the dynamics of imprisonment and rehabilitation for young people, staff members, teachers, and volunteers in the prison.

AB  - Many communities across the nation have invested their time and resources to provide enhanced outreach efforts to this group of families through specialized recovery management and motivational enhancement services, developing more than 360 family drug courts, focusing on improving data monitoring across the various systems, instituting comprehensive cross-system training programs, and developing state-wide strategic plans focused on improving outcomes. Studies such as the Adverse Childhood Experiences,1 which assessed the association between childhood maltreatment and later-life health and well-being consequences, have brought to light the impact of trauma on two sets of family members: children who are victims of child abuse or neglect and the extraordinarily high rate of parents in child welfare services who have significant trauma histories that must be addressed during treatment for their substance use disorder together with any co-occurring mental disorders.

Outreach services include information and referral; efforts to increase public awareness of and education on gangs, their behavior and activities, and how youth are potentially affected; prevention and intervention strategies and activities for gang-involved, gang-affected, and at-risk youth; and gang graffiti removal. The program calls for an individualized action plan to be developed for each client that incorporates individual advising, family intervention advising, group counseling and therapy, job placement, and cultural and recreational activities. An outreach program has been specifically designed for Southeast Asians. The nature of Asian gangs is examined, and Asian gang member involvement in auto theft and armed robbery is discussed.

AB  - Objectives: To examine rates of smoking and tobacco treatment utilization by insurance coverage status (Medicaid, commercial, exchange) among newly enrolled patients in the post Affordable Care Act (ACA) era. Methods: We examined new members who enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California through Medicaid, the California exchange, or nonexchange commercial plans (N = 122,298) in the first 6 months of 2014 following ACA implementation. We compared these groups on smoking prevalence and tested whether smokers in each group differed on sociodemographic characteristics and in their utilization of tobacco treatment (pharmacotherapy and counseling) in 2014. Results: Smoking prevalence was higher among Medicaid (22%) than exchange (13%) or commercial (12%) patients (P < 0.0001). Controlling for key sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, Medicaid (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.73) smokers had greater odds of tobacco treatment use than commercial smokers. Other groups at risk for underuse included men, younger patients, Asians, and Latinos. Conclusions: In this cohort of newly enrolled patients after ACA implementation, Medicaid patients were more likely to be smokers compared with exchange and commercial patients, but they were also more likely to use tobacco treatment. Low tobacco treatment use among exchange and commercial plan smokers, as well as younger men, Asians and Latinos poses a significant obstacle to improving public health and additional targeted outreach strategies may be needed to engage these patients with available health services.

AB  - Reviews literature on the problem of homelessness, including current attitudes and policies and causes of the problem. It is noted that the homeless are estimated to number about 2 million and that almost half are suffering from alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or mental health problems. Survey data and evaluations of mental health outreach programs have raised basic questions about the responsibilities of policymakers and service providers. It is suggested that improved systems of coordinated services and case management should be designed to link the homeless population and the larger service delivery system. Establishing this link within a model community support program is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The article identifies and discusses three models of youth work: prevention and intervention, positive youth development and personal change and self-discovery for choosing an appropriate model in order to meet the needs of today's youths. Preventative youth programs traditionally have been concerned with identifying specific adolescent risk factors and intervening, at the individual level, to create change. Programming efforts are aimed at controlling youth behavior by preventing young people from participating in activities known to be harmful. Program providers typically seek to eliminate specific risk factors from a young person's life in order to reduce the chance that problems will occur. Developmentalists add to the prevention framework by emphasizing the role that positive factors can play in creating and motivating "positive youth development." Instead of solely focusing on preventing youth problems and managing youth behavior, developmentalists seek to use positive factors and experiences in order to benefit young people in a variety of ways, by improving their physical, emotional, social and vocational competence. It is important for youth workers to actively involve youths in the process of program planning. In general, such an approach is typically described as youth-centered. This means that emphasis is placed on ensuring that young people feel that youth programs are places in which they belong.

AB  - The study examined the association of language spoken at home with the school and health risks and behaviors of Asian American adolescents. Using the United States component of the 1997-1998 World Health Organization Study of Health Behavior in School Children, bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted of records for Asian children to explore the relationship between language spoken at home and outcome variables regarding health behaviors, psychosocial and school risk factors, and parental factors. Compared to those who usually speak English at home, adolescents who usually speak another language, or who speak two languages equally, face a greater risk for health risk factors, psychosocial and school risk factors, and parental risk factors. Not speaking English at home was associated with higher health risks, including not wearing seat belts and bicycle helmets; higher psychosocial and school risk factors, including feeling that they do not belong at school, difficulty making new friends, and lacking confidence; and higher parental risks, including reporting that parents were not ready to help them or willing to talk to teachers. Adolescents less acculturated to the United States experience a variety of physical and psychosocial risks. School-based interventions such as early identification and outreach, needs assessment, and counseling and support services should be provided to immigrant students and their families.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the health status and health services access and utilization characteristics of US Chinese, Asian Indian, Filipino, other Asian/Pacific Islander (API), and non-Hispanic white children by using nationally representative data. METHODS: We analyzed the aggregated data file from the National Health Interview Survey from 1997 to 2000 including 334 Chinese, 287 Asian Indian, 292 Filipino, 696 'other API,' and 29,016 non-Hispanic white children <18 years old. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between Asian ethnicities and dependent variables including components of health status, health services access, and utilization. RESULTS: Logistic regression reveals that all Asian American children were less likely to miss school because of illness or injury or have learning disabilities compared with non-Hispanic whites. Other APIs were less likely to be taking prescription medication for at least 3 months, and Asian Indian children were half as likely to have chronic conditions. Chinese, Filipino, and other API children were more likely to be without contact with a health professional within the past 12 months. Citizenship/nativity status, maternal education attainment, and poverty status were all significant independent risk factors for health care access and utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Asian ethnicities and being foreign-born are generally associated with more favorable health status measures such as school absence, learning disability, use of prescription medications, and chronic conditions. However, these attributes are negatively associated with health care access and utilization, suggesting the need for outreach to Asian immigrant populations to educate them on accessing the US health care system.

AB  - Objectives. We examined health status and health services access and utilization of Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, South Asian, Vietnamese, and non-Hispanic White children in California. Methods. We analyzed aggregated data from the 2003 and 2005 California Health Interview Survey (648 Chinese, 523 Filipino, 235 Japanese, 308 Korean, 314 South Asian, 264 Vietnamese, and 8468 non-Hispanic White children aged younger than 12 years), examining the relationship between Asian ethnicities and outcomes. Results. Compared with non-Hispanic White children, Korean children were 4 times more likely to lack health insurance; Filipino children were twice as likely to not have had recent contact with a doctor; Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese children were less likely to have visited an emergency room in the past year; and Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese children were more likely to be in fair or poor health. Age, gender, poverty, citizenship-nativity status, health insurance, and parental marital and child health statuses were related to most outcomes. Conclusions. Asian ethnicities have heterogeneous health care access and utilization patterns, suggesting the need for targeted outreach to different Asian ethnic groups.

AB  - Informative dropout is a vexing problem for any biomedical study. Most existing statistical methods attempt to correct estimation bias related to this phenomenon by specifying unverifiable assumptions about the dropout mechanism. We consider a cohort study in Africa that uses an outreach programme to ascertain the vital status for dropout subjects. These data can be used to identify a number of relevant distributions. However, as only a subset of dropout subjects were followed, vital status ascertainment was incomplete. We use semi-competing risk methods as our analysis framework to address this specific case where the terminal event is incompletely ascertained and consider various procedures for estimating the marginal distribution of dropout and the marginal and conditional distributions of survival. We also consider model selection and estimation efficiency in our setting. Performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated via simulations, asymptotic study and analysis of the study data.

AB  - Conducting criminological fieldwork in a non-Western society remains a fascinating and mysterious enterprise. Among existing studies, very few have systematically examined the process and dynamics of conducting fieldwork in the Chinese criminal justice context. This study, based on the author's own experiences, reflects on the key stages in such fieldwork, including obtaining access to research, interviewing and observing, and addressing ethical concerns. At its core, the study seeks to examine two key dynamics, guanxi and mianzi, focusing on how they work and the ways in which they can shape the outcomes of fieldwork. This study serves as a preliminary step in the hope that future research that endeavors to develop indigenous criminology in China will provide a proper theoretical framework and a more systematic examination.

AB  - The global rise in non-communicable disease (NCD) suggests that US-based refugees are increasingly affected by chronic conditions. However, health services have focused on the detection of infectious disease, with relatively limited data on chronic NCDs. Using data from a retrospective medical record review of a refugee health program in the urban Northeast (n = 180), we examined the prevalence of chronic NCDs and NCD risk factors among adult refugees who had recently arrived in the US, with attention to region of origin and family composition. Family composition was included because low-income adults without dependent children are at high risk of becoming uninsured. We found that half of the adult refugees in this sample had at least one chronic NCD (51.1%), and 9.5% had three or more NCDs. Behavioral health diagnoses were most common (15.0%), followed by hypertension (13.3%). Half of adults were overweight or obese (54.6%). Chronic NCDs were somewhat more common among adults from Iraq, but this difference was not significant (56.8 vs. 44.6%). Chronic NCDs were common among adults with and without dependent children (61.4 vs. 44.6%, respectively), and these two groups did not significantly differ in their likelihood of having a chronic NCD after adjustment for age and gender (AOR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.39, 1.55). This study suggests that chronic NCDs are common among adult refugees in the US, including refugees at high risk for uninsurance. We propose that refugee health services accommodate screening and treatment for chronic NCDs and NCD risk factors, and that insurance outreach and enrollment programs target recently arrived refugees.

AB  - Background: Improved nutrition intake in drug rehabilitation programmes enhances quality sobriety and prevents relapses. However, little is known about the nutritional status of substance users and institutionalised abstainers. Previous nutritional studies have mainly focused on methamphetamine, whereas ketamine has not been investigated despite its popularity amongst adolescents. Objectives: To compare nutrient intake and underweight status amongst three groups of adolescents -current substance users, institutionalised abstainers and never users (controls) - and examine the association between ketamine use and nutrient intake. Design: This is a cross-sectional questionnaire survey which was conducted using face-to-face interview. Substance users (n = 202) and never users (n = 100) were invited through the outreach social workers of three non-government organisations. Abstainers (n = 50) were recruited from three drug rehabilitation centres. Nutrient intake was assessed through two 24-h recalls. Other information collected included anthropometrics, socio-demographic characteristics and substance type used over the previous month. Results: Only 20.8 and 15.9% of male and female substance users met the daily energy requirements. Male users were less likely to meet the recommended intake of energy {[}odds ratio (OR) = 0.37] and protein (OR = 0.10) than controls. Overall, abstainers had better intake of beneficial nutrients than substance users. However, abstainers were more likely to overconsume harmful nutrients, such as cholesterol and sodium. Regarding weight status, female substance users (56.1%) were more likely to be underweight than abstainers (14.8%) (OR = 8.85). Amongst underweight female substance users, 52.2% were still trying to lose more weight. Moreover, ketamine users tended to have lower intake of nutrients from animal sources than the users of other drugs. Conclusions: Adolescent substance users are at risk of energy and nutrient inadequacy. Misconceptions about body weight are disseminating amongst them. The study findings provide valuable information for front-line workers taking care of young substance users and for institutions providing residential rehabilitation programmes.

AB  - In March 1993 a group of Russian and American women convened in Moscow to discuss the creation of a Russian rape crisis center. This group decided that the mission and goals of the organization would be to provide assistance, crisis intervention, and advocacy for rape survivors; educate the public about violence against women; and develop model programs for prevention and staff/volunteer training. After a 10-month evolutionary process, the Moscow Sexual Assault Recovery Center has developed as an institution with a board of directors, an office, a hotline, computers, office equipment, and a lending library. In October 1993 the center began recruiting professional staff and hotline volunteers at a national conference on sexual violence. The Center currently operates with a board of directors, an executive director, a program coordinator, an accountant, a staff gynecologist, 10 paid hotline workers, and more than 20 volunteers. Women design, develop, and implement the Center's programs. In addition to the hotline, the Center is involved in a number of other projects. Public outreach is an important goal of the Center. In the area of publishing, the center has translated and distributed training literature and also has translated and published a book on child sexual abuse. In the area of educational training, three women have presented a training program for medical personnel to more than 150 medical students in Moscow. Currently, the Center is developing curricula for an education program in the schools. The Center will continue to serve as an advocacy group that lobbies for more effective enforcement of existing legislation as well as the drafting and development of new laws to protect the rights of victims.

AB  - Describes a 3-yr program to prevent alcohol abuse among Latino youths (aged 12–17 yrs) in East Harlem, New York. Existing literature on alcohol use by Latino youth is reviewed, followed by a description of the program, its setting, and evaluative methodology. Interviews were conducted with 80 participants and with staff, and additional data were available on 752 participants. Results of the program are presented in terms of (1) changes in alcohol knowledge, attitudes, and behavior; (2) participants' feedback on workshops and activities; and (3) participation and attrition rates. Results suggest that due to culture, class, and skills differences, Ss could not be readily engaged in the traditional educational process. However, positive changes were observed in the third of the sample who were the most regular participants, which are attributed to the use of culturally relevant materials, outreach to parents, and role modeling by staff.

AB  - Over the past decade, myriad social and economic factors have fueled a burgeoning population of people who inject heroin in sub-Saharan Africa, creating an urgent need for HIV prevention and treatment services tailored to this marginalized group. While the epidemic in the region remains largely driven through heterosexual risk behavior, a higher probability of disease acquisition per exposure can lead to rapid transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID). Stigma and discrimination isolates PWID from accessing available HIV care services designed for the general population and has contributed to HIV prevalence in PWID up to four times greater than country averages. To address this crisis, a few trailblazing governments with support from international HIV/AIDS funders have begun to develop and in the case of Tanzania, implement, comprehensive national harm reduction services for people who use and inject drugs. This dissertation contributes to the growing body of implementation science literature on medication assisted treatment programs (MAT) for PWID in sub-Saharan Africa. This dissertation takes a three-paper model to identify programmatic and policy strategies to enroll, retain and support patients in MAT programs, focusing on Tanzania. The first paper, a systematic review of the literature on methadone as an HIV prevention intervention, describes evidence-based best practices and applies key findings to make recommendations about service delivery in a limited resource setting. Results suggest that enhanced outreach and increased dosing can help maximize service utilization. The second and third papers delve into the experiences of the first MAT program on mainland sub-Saharan Africa, located at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The program has successfully implemented a continuum of harm reduction care, culminating in methadone treatment for PWID. However, monitoring and evaluation data highlight a gender disparity in service utilization, with women comprising less than 10% of clients. Relying on in-depth interviews and observational data collected over three field visits from July 2011 to February 2013, the last two articles look at ongoing service needs for women in treatment and identify strategies to bring more women into care. Results suggest that women face distinct hardship in treatment, needing increased psychosocial support services and economic development interventions to help them heal histories of sexual trauma and regain custody of their children. Additionally, outreach tailored to women can help increase treatment enrollment. Findings from this dissertation have implications for MAT programs in Tanzania and in other areas in the region with similar epidemiological and cultural environments.

AB  - Brains Rule! Neuroscience Expositions, funded through a National Institute on Drug Abuse Science Education Drug Abuse Partnership Award, has developed a successful model for informal neuroscience education. Each Exposition is a "reverse science fair" in which neuroscientists present short neuroscience teaching modules to students. This study focuses on results of assessments conducted with neuroscientist presenters during Expositions at two sites, Atlanta, Georgia and Corpus Christi, Texas. The effects of participating in the Expositions on presenters' perceptions of their own presentation and communication skills were evaluated, as was the potential for increased active participation by neuroscientists in future outreach programs. In four of the five Expositions studied, pre- versus post-event surveys demonstrated significant changes in presenters' perceptions of their own abilities to explain neuroscience concepts to children. Over the course of an Exposition, presenters learned to fit their approaches to conveying neuroscience concepts to fifth through eighth graders and learned to link information they presented about the brain and nervous system to children's past experiences to improve comprehension. The present data suggest that Brains Rule! Neuroscience Expositions are effective in improving communication and teaching skills among neuroscience professionals and contribute to professional stewardship by increasing motivation to participate in future informal education programs.

AB  - It's not easy to keep young people on task for learning in a youth prison, but David Domenici, the principal of the Maya Angelou Academy, a charter-like school serving incarcerated juveniles, is trying to do it while at the same time creating a model program for improving educational services for young offenders. Located at the New Beginnings Youth Development Center, a lockup facility housing young men convicted of crimes in the District of Columbia, Maya Angelou is one of a small number of schools run by charter school operators targeting incarcerated youths. As of late last month, the academy was educating 60 to 70 teenagers, ages 14 to 19, who were serving time for crimes ranging from unauthorized use of a vehicle, to armed robbery, to manslaughter. A few stay as little as five days; others may be incarcerated for a year. Yet, in the short time they're at the Maya Angelou Academy, Mr. Domenici hopes to give each of them the best education possible and also likely the best education they've ever had. The See Forever Foundation, a nonprofit organization that operates three charter schools in the District of Columbia, won the contract to provide education services to incarcerated youths more than three years ago from Washington's Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services. Mr. Domenici, a lawyer and a son of former U.S. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., initially co-established the foundation with fellow lawyer James Forman Jr. in order to run a school for youths who had been arrested. The small program grew, though, into three charter schools serving a broad range of students. Before the foundation turned its attention to youths at the lockup facility, those services were managed by the District of Columbia school system. The facility was known then as Oak Hill and was housed in decrepit buildings in Laurel, 20 miles north of the nation's capital. Problems at Oak Hill led to an ongoing consent decree from the District of Columbia Superior Court to improve services, including education, for Washington's juvenile delinquents.

AB  - Introduction: Many barriers exist to integrating smoking cessation into delivery of lung cancer screening including limited provider time and patient misconceptions. Aims: To demonstrate that proactive outreach from a telephone counsellor outside of the patient's usual care team is feasible and acceptable to patients. Methods: Smokers undergoing lung cancer screening were approached for a telephone counselling study. Patients agreeing to participate in the intervention (n = 27) received two telephone counselling sessions. A 30-day follow-up evaluation was conducted, which also included screening participants receiving usual care (n = 56). Results/Findings: Most (89%) intervention participants reported being satisfied with the proactive calls, and 81% reported the sessions were helpful. Use of behavioural cessation support programs in the intervention group was four times higher (44%) compared to the usual care group (11%); Relative Risk (RR) = 4.1; 95% CI: 1.7 to 9.9), and seven-day abstinence in the intervention group was double (19%) compared to the usual care group (7%); RR = 2.6; 95% CI: 0.8 to 8.9). Conclusions: This practical telephone-based approach, which included risk messages clarifying continued risks of smoking in the context of screening results, suggests such messaging can boost utilisation of evidence-based tobacco treatment, self-efficacy, and potentially increase the likelihood of successful quitting.

AB  - An explicit or implicit objective of most development policies and projects is the reduction of poverty. Microfinance as well as social safety net programs can potentially improve the living standard of the poor by providing financial services or social transfers to the poor. Thus, as a pre-condition, they must reach the very poor population segments, which is often not sufficiently verified during project implementation. This paper presents the results of two case studies dealing with this problem, one considering the case of social safety net programs in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia and the other one the case of a microfinance institution operating in Mexico. In both cases, the depth of poverty outreach is measured using an indicator-based poverty assessment method. The method collects information on various dimensions of poverty and then aggregates this information with principal component analysis into a composite index. An index is computed for each household and serves as a basis to compare the poverty level of randomly selected program participants and non-participants residing in the operational area of the program. The major strength of the method is the measurement of relative poverty, its operational ease with respect to time and cost, and its adaptability to different conditions. The paper presents and discusses the results of the two case studies and highlights the potential use of the method for similar assessments of the poverty outreach of targeted policy and project interventions.

AB  - Summary: Many development policies seek to target the poorest to provide them access to key services. However, there is a lack at present of low-cost and reliable methods for assessing whether a policy reaches the poorest. We present an operational method to assess the relative poverty of targeted recipients for services. The method constructs a multi-dimensional poverty index through principle component analysis using a range of poverty-related indicators. The method was tested in India, Kenya, Madagascar, and Nicaragua. Results from these studies support our belief that the method has a potential for assessing the extent to which the poorest are reached by targeted development projects, programs, or policy instruments.

AB  - Microfinance is often seen as an effective tool to reach the poor, yet there is a paucity of studies on the poverty level of microfinance clients, differentiated by type of microfinance institution. This paper seeks to make a contribution in closing that knowledge gap, and focuses on Bangladesh and Peru, two of the pioneering countries in microfinance. We examine the poverty status of savers and borrowers with micro-banks, savings and credit cooperatives, and NGO-based microfinance institutions. In order to determine the poverty status of clients, the analysis is carried out for national as well as international poverty lines. Member- or NGO-based microfinance institutions are found to have a higher poverty outreach.

AB  - Street-based female sex workers ( SSWs) are subjected to a relatively high risk of HIV transmission, even higher than establishment-based female sex workers in China. However, very few HIV intervention programmes have targeted this particular group to date. Based in Southwest China, this study aims to identify perceived barriers, demands and suggestions on HIV prevention from the perspectives of SSWs, clients and healthcare providers in Chongqing. Face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted in July 2008 with 23 participants. They were recruited by purposive, convenience sampling and included 12 SSWs, 5 male clients, 4 government healthcare providers and 2 outreach workers from a community-based non-governmental organisation. Thematic analysis was used. SSWs were largely rural-to-urban migrants with a low socioeconomic status. Most of their clients shared a similar background. Both SSWs and their clients demonstrated a low awareness of HIV infection and a lack of understanding of effective preventive strategies. Financial hardships, lack of family support, fear of police arrest and stigma in relation to sex work were identified as SSWs' major barriers for accessing healthcare services. Both SSWs and their clients indicated an urgent demand for accessing adequate HIV prevention and care programmes. On the other hand, government organisations trying to provide services to this group have also encountered obstacles, specifically their limited ability to establish mutual trust. Programmes provided by community-based non-governmental organisation, however, were perceived to be more attractive. In conclusion, there remains a substantial gap between the need of adequate HIV prevention services for SSWs and their clients and what is currently available. Strengthening inter-sectoral collaboration, providing specifically tailored health services, actively involving SSW peers and their clients, and reducing stigma in the society are keys to meet this urgent demand by SSWs in China.

AB  - Evaluated the involvement of social workers in organizing local programs to prevent behavioral disorders among young adolescents. 189 social workers, who were members of different governmental and non-governmental organizations in Croatia, were assessed using the 17-item scale for evaluating the contribution of social workers in a local community (HR-SROZ-97). A systematic review of the data identified 3 major objectives in organizing local programs: (1) development of innovative street outreach interventions; (2) implementation of theoretical models; and (3) intensification and utilization of the appropriate community resources for young adolescents with behavioral disorders.

AB  - [Ching Kwan Lee]'s inquiry begins with a puzzle she has observed in Liaoning and Guandong where she conducted her fieldwork. Both places have witnessed massive labour unrest, yet the form and content of the protests are strikingly different. In Liaoning where the socialist planned economy is dying and workers are left stranded in a wasteland of bankrupt factories, veteran workers take their grievances to the street and make moral claims for their basic survival rights. They engage in a particular form of political bargaining by shaming local corrupt officials and by disrupting traffic and public order in order to gain societal attention. She terms this type of action "protests of desperation" in a Polanyian sense because the driving force behind this collective mobilization is to resist the commodification of labour brought by the privatization policy and to reject their abandonment by the state. Lee argues that the basis of this kind of labour activism still rests upon the notion of "social contract" formed in the socialist system. Workers thus see the state as the holder of moral responsibility to take care of its people, especially the working class that was once the core constituency of the socialist regime. These workers have a strong sense of social entitlement even though historical conditions have changed. In their struggles, laid-off workers often invoke Maoist notions of working-class status and social entitlements, and rarely make use of the legal system to solve their problems. Lee's book provides a detailed account of three types of protests: nonpayment protests involving unpaid pensions and wages, neighbourhood protests involving substandard community services and forced relocation, and bankruptcy protests involving disputes over compensation and corruption. What makes her account powerful and convincing are the rich personal narratives by factory workers who delineate their struggle, plight, and interpretation of the changing situation and their fate. Lee further explores what kinds of insurgent identities or subjectivities are created in this process. Her analysis suggests that workers do not rely on a single form of identity but draw from a repertoire of multiple subject positions, which includes class, citizens, and the masses. They make claims based on their workers' position that assumed a master status in society under socialism, or as citizens gongmin) with basic rights, or as the disadvantaged working masses (gongren qunzhong). The co-existence of multiple positions allows workers to use different strategies depending on the specific situations facing them. Turning to the Sunbelt in the south, we witness another wave of labour protests staged by younger migrant workers in global sweatshops. Lee terms this kind of labour unrest "protests against discrimination." Here the social contract sanctioned by socialism has been largely replaced by the legal contract between labour and capital. The primary goal of workers' struggles is to resist harsh conditions of capitalist production and labour exploitation, rather than to claim social entitlements. Pun Ngai's ethnography, Made in China, echoes this account by providing another in-depth account of the subjective experiences of labour discipline among young migrant women (dagong mei) working in capitalist factories of the south. In contrast with laid-off workers in the north, migrant workers frequently seek legal mobilization to settle their problems by turning to the labour bureau and the court. Petitions and lawsuits become a preferred weapon of the weak against their powerful employers and corporations. Lee has identified three types of common grievance among migrant workers. The most prominent problem is centred on unpaid wages or illegal deduction of payment. The second is harsh labour discipline and physical violence imposed on workers' bodies. The last type involves work-related injuries and the lack of compensation. One of the most interesting findings in this book is contrary to the experience of veteran workers in the north, class consciousness is almost muted among migrant workers because they rarely view themselves as a unified class with shared interests and solidarity. Rather, they tend to see themselves as second-class citizens (outsiders in the city) and subalterns (ruoshi qunti). Lee's account demonstrates that while "the rule of law" has become a dominant official discourse, migrant workers are able to appropriate this language for their own struggle. It is in this context that the notion of "against the law" becomes a common idiom for workers to demand social justice and contest unfair treatment.

AB  - Objective: To explore the feasibility of offering HIV counseling and testing in community health centers (CHCs) and to provide evidence for the HIV/AIDS response in China. Methods: Forty-two CHCs were selected from the eight cities that participated in the study. Rapid testing was mainly provided to: clients seeking HIV testing and counseling (HTC); outpatients with high-risk behavior of contracting HIV; inpatients and outpatients of key departments. Aggregate administrative data were collected in CHCs and general hospitals and differences between the two categories were compared. Results: There were 23,609 patients who underwent HIV testing, accounting for 0.37% of all estimated clinic visits at the 42 sites (0.03%–4.35% by site). Overall, positive screening prevalence was 0.41% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33%–0.49%, range 0.00%–0.98%), which is higher than in general hospitals (0.17%). The identification efficiency was 0.22% (95% CI: 0.16%–0.27%) in pilot CHCs, 3.5 times higher than in general hospitals (0.06%) (Chi square test = 95.196, p<0.001). The percentage of those receiving confirmatory tests among those who screened positive was slightly lower in CHCs (73.7%) than in general hospitals (80.1%) (Chi-square test = 17.472, p<0.001). Composition of clients mobilized for testing was consistent with the usage of basic public health and medical services in CHCs. The rate of patients testing HIV positive was higher among patients from key CHC departments (0.68%) than among high-risk Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) clients (0.56%), those participating in outreach activities (0.41%), pregnant women (0.05%), and surgical patients (0.00%). Conclusion: This project demonstrates that providing HIV testing services for patients who exhibit high risk behavior has a high HIV case detection rate and that CHCs have the capacity to integrate HTC into routine work. It provides concrete evidence supporting the involvement of CHCs in the expansion of HIV/AIDS testing and case finding.

AB  - Objective: Individuals who are homeless or vulnerably housed have a higher prevalence of concurrent disorders, defined as having a mental health diagnosis and problematic substance use, compared to the general housed population. The study objective was to investigate the effect of having concurrent disorders on health care utilization among homeless or vulnerably housed individuals, using longitudinal data from the Health and Housing in Transition Study. Methods: In 2009, 1190 homeless or vulnerably housed adults were recruited in Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver, Canada. Participants completed baseline interviews and four annual follow-up interviews, providing data on sociodemographics, housing history, mental health diagnoses, problematic drug use with the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), problematic alcohol use with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), chronic health conditions, and utilization of the following health care services: emergency department (ED), hospitalization, and primary care. Concurrent disorders were defined as the participant having ever received a mental health diagnosis at baseline and having problematic substance use (i.e., DAST-10 6 and/or AUDIT 20) at any time during the study period. Three generalized mixed effects logistic regression models were used to examine the independent association of having concurrent disorders and reporting ED use, hospitalization, or primary care visits in the past 12 months. Results: Among our sample of adults who were homeless or vulnerably housed, 22.6% (n = 261) reported having concurrent disorders at baseline. Individuals with concurrent disorders had significantly higher odds of ED use (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 1.71; 95% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.4-2.11), hospitalization (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.16-1.81), and primary care visits (AOR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05-1.71) in the past 12 months over the four-year follow-up period, after adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusions: Concurrent disorders were associated with higher rates of health care utilization when compared to those without concurrent disorders among homeless and vulnerably housed individuals. Comprehensive programs that integrate mental health and addiction services with primary care as well as community-based outreach may better address the unmet health care needs of individuals living with concurrent disorders who are vulnerable to poor health outcomes.

AB  - Today, many immigrant neighborhoods are plagued with poverty, inadequate schools, family disruption, single parenthood, teenage pregnancies, youth gangs, violent crimes, drug abuse and alcoholism, and anti-intellectual youth subcultures. Such unsettling environments put immigrant children of the inner city at greater risk than those living elsewhere. This brief reports on a study that focused on three immigrant neighborhoods in Los Angeles (Korean, Chinese, Latino) to examine ways in which neighborhood-based social structures influence immigrant children's after-school life by investigating types of social structures and differences by race/ethnicity; how these structures interact with one another to contribute to community-building, and types of social relations that the different structures foster. Fieldwork included pre-arranged one-on-one interviews with adolescents and adults with teenage children; random interviews with parents, local leaders, social workers and business owners' nonintrusive participant observations of structured activities and random gatherings; and participant observations with researchers doing volunteer work in selective publicly funded programs for children and parents, private after-school services, and cultural centers. Data from the U.S. census, California Department of Education and Los Angeles Unified School District were analyzed, as well as mainstream and ethnic media. Three demographic patterns were noted: racial makeup, nativity, and poverty. Public schools reflect these patterns. A wide range of retail businesses are found in the three neighborhoods, and all three also have various ethnically specific businesses and professional services. Formal organizations and institutions with specific programs serving children or youths exist in all three neighborhoods. The numbers and types of both nonprofit community-based organizations (CBOs) and the programs they offer do not vary drastically. Many depend primarily on public funds or on a combination of funds from various levels of government, private foundations, and individual or organizational donations. Although the functions and services of nonprofit CBOs are similar across ethnic neighborhoods, inequalities exist in the availability of private services oriented toward youths. The study found that children and adolescents who are involved in supervised after-school activities in their neighborhoods tend to do better in school, be more ambitious and articulate about their college plans and future careers, and have a clearer sense of purpose than those who are not so involved. Researchers postulate that the Asian-Latino difference in school performance and college preparation is largely due to the noted unequal access to neighborhood-based resources, such as privately run after-school activities. The study concludes that publicly funded school-based and community-based after-school programs are instrumental but insufficient in inner-city neighborhoods. Nonprofit and faith-based organizations have the experience and infrastructure to implement such support for immigrant families, yet they are largely under-funded and under-staffed. The role of ethnic entrepreneurship is critical for community building, as is the case of private supplementary educational establishments for facilitating the flow of information and enhancing intergenerational relations. The study recommends state action to: (1) provide multilingual educational materials to inform immigrant communities about college preparation and options; (2) encourage inter-group relations and coalitions by providing incentives to neighborhood businesses that provide services to more than one ethnic group, and allocating resources to building public-private partnerships; and (3) provide incentives to entrepreneurs to develop educational enrichment and other educationally related programs.

AB  - This research examines the effectiveness of two national awareness campaigns in their ability to increase rates of insurance coverage among low-income children potentially eligible for public health insurance programs. The campaigns evaluated are the 2005 and 2006 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Cover the Uninsured Week and the Back to School Campaign. Differential rates of exposure to earned media (television, radio, and print news coverage) are estimated for large metropolitan area in the United States. The exposure variables are matched to children in the Current Population Survey (CPS). Controlling for relevant individual and family characteristics and metropolitan area, the impact of each type of exposure is estimated. Two outcomes are considered: a campaign's ability to encourage enrollment among those uninsured prior to exposure and its ability to sustain coverage among those that are already insured in the pre-exposure period. The campaigns are posited to assist in overcoming one of three types of cost to enrollment: information, process, and outcome costs (perceived outcome) of enrollment. The results are also considered in light of the knowledge gap hypothesis. This research produces evidence that Back to School print coverage increased rates of coverage by as much as 2.5 percentage points. Children living in areas with more Back to School print coverage were more likely to maintain insurance coverage from one year to the next. This result holds when considering all children in metropolitan areas and low-income children estimated to be eligible in the pre or post-exposure period. Looking at subpopulations of eligible children, there is evidence that campaigns work best as encouraging insurance enrollment for children that are in good health, that are not Hispanic and that are in families with more than one child and that are below 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). At the same time, there is evidence that the campaigns work best at maintaining coverage among children that are not black and are U.S. born and that are in families that have higher educational attainment, do not have full time workers, have multiple children, and have incomes greater than 133 percent FPL. Also presented as an appendix to this research are methods to harmonize insurance coverage in the CPS for all years since the inception of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Using the 1997-2007 CPS methods are introduced to correct for various methodological and conceptual changes to the measurement of health insurance coverage in the CPS, which is the source most often used for documenting trends in coverage. Included in this, is a novel approach for correcting the change in estimates due to the introduction of the health insurance verification question in 2000. This harmonized time series can be used going forward as further attempts are made to disentangle the effects of outreach and education in stimulating enrollment in public health insurance programs.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a pilot peer education STI prevention programme with male sex workers. Design: A process and outcome evaluation of the pilot programme undertaken in three London male escort agencies, using a quasi-experimental design. Subjects: Workers in three London escort agencies, including 88 who completed a questionnaire, five peer educators, and a further 16 men (including management) working in two of these agencies. Methods: A peer education STI prevention programme run by the Working Men Project (WMP), a specialist sexual health service for male sex workers, was piloted in two London escort agencies. Five male sex workers participated in a 2 day peer education training programme. They then returned to their respective agencies to disseminate information and condoms, in an attempt to influence norms of behaviour. An outcome evaluation aimed to assess changes in STI related knowledge, high risk sexual behaviour, and attendance at a sexual health service. A pre-intervention questionnaire assessing variables such as STI related knowledge, sexual behaviour, and demographic information was administered in both agency A and agency B and a third agency, C, which acted as a control. Ten weeks after the peer educators returned to their agencies, the same questionnaire was administered in the same agencies. Peer educator referrals to the WMP were also recorded over this time period. The process evaluation involved interviews and focus groups with peer educators, and the completion of diaries about their experiences in the role. A further 16 men working in the agencies (including managers and an owner) were interviewed about their experience of the programme. Participant observation was also undertaken through regular outreach work to the agencies. Results: 57 men completed the questionnaire at time 1 and 44: at time 2. Unfortunately, only 13 of these were matched, precluding any meaningful analysis of change in STI related knowledge and sexual behaviour. The questionnaire provided a profile of the men working in the agencies. Of the 88 men who completed the questionnaire at least oner, the majority were homosexual, and in their late teens/early 20s. Most were of a ``white{''} ethnic group, though there was some range within these categories. Most preferred to speak English and education levels were high. Relative STI knowledge revealed a high understanding of HIV and hepatitis B, moderate understanding of gonorrhoea, syphilis, genital warts and herpes, and little knowledge of non-specific urethritis (NSU) or chlamydia. Sexual behaviour suggested a highly sexually active population with both male and female paying and non-paying partners. Condom use was highest for paying partners, particularly for anal sex. Condom use for oral sex with all partners was less consistent, and condom use for all types of sex with regular partners was lower than with other partners. The small number of men engaging in vaginal sex with paying and regular partners were less likely to use condoms. 26 new patients registered at the WMP as a result of peer educator referrals, representing 65% of all new contacts over thr study period. The process evaluation revealed that while the training programme was considered adequate and while peer educators felt the programme and their roles to be a success, their experience of the role was difficult. The role of management support was crucial in supporting the programme. The assumption that ``peers{''} are particularly effective educators was not borne out by the results. While peers were considered suitable to discuss some aspects of the industry, many preferred to consult ``professionals{''} about health related matters. The concept of ``peers{''} was problematic with most of the men drawing ``peers{''} from subgroups within the agencies. Other constraints on behaviour such as a lack of power, particularly with regard to a lack of management support, or poverty, had a substantial impact on behaviour which were not influenced by the peer educators. Conclusions: The study illustrated the difficulties of utilising quasi-experimental evaluation methodology with this client group. It also demonstrated the limitations of peer education based on information provision health education models which focus on individual behaviour change. Suggestions are given for future interventions.

AB  - Objective: Little is known about the public's knowledge of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Although preventive screening is available, millions of Americans remain unaware of their risk. Improved health literacy has been associated with increased screening and improvement in health outcomes. This study assessed the level of AAA literacy among respondents who participated in a free AAA screening event. Methods: Thirteen key words used by vascular surgeons to describe the risk, diagnosis, and treatment options for AAA were extracted from the screening tool used by the nation's largest provider of free AAA diagnostic services, AAA-neurysm Outreach. The National Institutes of Health recommends readability of patient education materials to be at the sixth-grade level, but a readability analysis of these words placed them at a grade level of 14.6. A self-administrated questionnaire was developed that allowed respondents to compare each of the extracted words with a definitionally correct or incorrect word that reflected a sixth-grade readability score. These scores were then compared with the available demographics. Results: There were 570 completed questionnaires. Of the participants, 57.6% were female, 61.4% were 60 and above, and 32.6% were veterans. The average number of correct answers was 9.31 out of 13 (72% correct). Only 4.7% answered all questions correctly, with 29.1% missing five or more answers. The most frequently missed words were asymptomatic, screening, and cholesterol (56.5%, 44%, and 41.4% incorrect, respectively). The most frequently known terms were abdominal, diagnosis, and genetic (96%, 95.3%, and 91.9% correct, respectively). The remaining words fell between these extremes. Those aged 60 and above scored significantly lower than younger respondents (P < .0001). A post hoc power analysis indicated that the power to detect the obtained effects of age at the.05 level was greater than 0.95. Gender and veteran status did not produce any significant differences. Conclusions: These data suggest an important communication gap between the words used by clinicians to describe the risks, diagnostic results, and treatment options of AAA and the targeted at-risk population, especially those 60 years and older.

AB  - Physicians are among the highest risk groups for suicide, and emerging data suggest this risk begins early in medical training. We describe a screening program at one medical center for identifying and referring physicians and students who may be at risk for suicide, and we explore differences between groups with respect to depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation (SI) and behaviors, and utilization of mental health resources. Over a 5-year period (May 2009–August 2014), we invited 1,134 medical students, 1,380 house staff (residents and fellows), and 1,922 faculty to complete an anonymous web-based 'stress' questionnaire including items about depression symptoms, SI and behaviors, emotional distress features, drinking and drug-use behaviors, problematic eating, and utilization of treatments for depression and anxiety. Response rates among each group ranged from 17% (house staff) to 33% (students). Overall, 7% to 10% of respondents met criteria for a current major depressive syndrome, and 9% to 11% of respondents endorsed current SI. Similarities in depression severity and SI between groups far outweighed differences. The following were the four unique predictors of SI: presence of moderately severe or severe depressive symptoms, impairment, hopelessness, and past attempts. Only 17% of those endorsing current SI were taking antidepressant medication, and only 12% were receiving psychotherapy. However, 16% accepted referrals provided through this program. Increased efforts at education and destigmatization, outreach, assessment, and treatment at medical schools are essential. Our educational and screening program is one model others might employ to work toward this goal, though it is likely that additional outreach methods are needed.

AB  - This report addresses three levels of questions about the effectiveness of the Michigan State University Multiple Risk Outreach Program (MROP). The MROP was designed to recruit families from this high-risk population and test the implementation of an intervention protocol in a population-based program for 3- to 6-year-olds and their families. This intervention protocol had proven to be effective in the management and reduction of conduct problems among older, clinically referred children. A total of 99 families, all Caucasian, formed the study sample. Questions addressed concerned: (1) the effectiveness of the recruitment strategy; (2) characteristics of the mother-only treatment condition, the both-parents treatment condition, and the no-treatment control condition; and (3) the outcome for children in families who received the intervention protocol versus the outcome for those who did not. Data from the subset of families who completed the intervention and the study through the posttreatment assessment and evaluation phase are presented. (RH)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Latino children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) at older ages and at the point of more severe symptoms. We sought to qualitatively describe community, family, and health care system barriers to ASD diagnosis in Latino children. METHODS: Five focus groups and 4 qualitative interviews were conducted with 33 parents of Latino children previously diagnosed with an ASD. Participants described Latino community perceptions of autism and barriers they experienced during the diagnostic process. Sessions were audiorecorded and transcribed. Transcripts were coded by 2 researchers, and data were analyzed using thematic, analysis. RESULTS: Parents reported low levels of ASD information and high levels of mental health and disability stigma in the Latino community. Parents had poor access to care as a result of poverty, limited English proficiency, and lack of empowerment to take advantage of services. Providers sometimes dismissed parents' concerns. The ASD diagnostic process itself was slow, inconvenient, confusing, and uncomfortable for the child. These factors led many parents to normalize their child's early behaviors, deny that a problem existed, and lose trust in the medical system. CONCLUSIONS: Additional educational outreach to Latino families, destigmatization of ASD, streamlining the ASD diagnostic process, and providing additional support to Latino parents of at-risk children may decrease delays in ASD diagnosis among Latino, children.

AB  - This issue of journal, Australian Social Work, briefs about the importance of social workers. They play a role in advocating for the voices of services users to be heard and incorporated into policy responses, as well as making visible gaps in policy that prevents better outcomes for people who experience homelessness. This includes advocating for improved workplace conditions and wages for non-government workers, keeping visible homelessness as it affects women and children who are experiencing violence in their own homes, as well as advocating for developing effective outreach responses to people who experience rough sleeping, alongside preventative and affordable housing strategies. Responses to homelessness are an emerging area of practice for social workers. Homelessness is a serious national and worldwide policy issue, which has gained an increased focus in Australia through discourses of social inclusion. The government, elected on a social justice platform, immediately began work to address important social issues such as homelessness through a social inclusion agenda. This included principles of reducing disadvantage, increasing social, civil, and economic participation, building individual and community strengths, partnerships, tailoring services, giving high priority to early intervention, joined-up solutions, and evidence-based policy.

AB  - This exploratory study assesses the utility of substance abuse treatment as a strategy for preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission among injecting drug users (IDUs). Data analyzed in this study were collected in San Antonio, TX, 1989 through 1995 using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative data included ethnographic interviews with 234 active IDUs; quantitative data included baseline risk assessments and HIV screening plus interviews follow-up interviews administered approximately six months later to 823 IDUs participating in a Federally-funded AIDS community outreach demonstration project. Findings that have particularly important implications for substance abuse treatment as an HIV prevention strategy for IDUs are listed below. (1) IDUs who wanted treatment were significantly more likely to be daily heroin users. (2) IDUs who want treatment were significantly more likely to have been to treatment previously. (3) IDUs who wanted treatment at baseline reported significantly higher levels of HIV risk than IDUs who did not want treatment. (4) IDUs who went to treatment between their baseline and follow-up interviews reported significantly higher levels of HIV risk at baseline than IDUs who did not go to treatment. (5) IDUs who went to treatment between their baseline and follow-up interviews reported significantly greater decreases in injection-related HIV risk behaviors. (6) IDUs who went to treatment reported significantly greater decreases in sexual HIV risk behaviors than IDUs who did not go to treatment. This study also noted a number of factors that may limit the effectiveness of substance abuse treatment in reducing HIV risk among IDUs. Findings suggest that the impact of methadone maintenance on HIV risk behaviors among opioid dependent IDUs may be limited by the negative manner in which it is perceived by IDUs as well as other elements of society. One consequence of the negative perception of methadone maintenance held by many elements of society may be an unwillingness to provide public funding for an adequate number of methadone maintenance slots. Thus many IDUs who would be willing to enter methadone maintenance are unable to enter it and many IDUs who do enter it are forced to drop out prematurely.

AB  - This study examined relationships between emotional self-efficacy (ESE) and alcohol and tobacco use in a statewide sample of public high school adolescents (n = 2,566). The Center for Disease Control Youth Risk Behavior Survey and an adolescent ESE scale were utilized. Logistic regression analyses indicated the presence of any significant race by gender associations between lower ESE and alcohol and tobacco use. Results suggest that alcohol and cigarette use was significantly associated (p ≤ .05) with lower levels of ESE for certain race/gender groups. Results have implications for school- and community-based mental health services and substance use prevention/education programs for adolescents. Measures of ESE as a component of comprehensive assessments of adolescent mental health in fieldwork, research, and substance abuse prevention/education program evaluation efforts should be considered.

AB  - Literature suggests that psychosocial support programmes can improve wellbeing and mental health among learners. There is however limited documentation on methodologies and factors that shape integration of such programmes within the education sector. This qualitative study aimed to contribute towards addressing this knowledge gap by analysing the implementation process of the Mainstreaming of Psychosocial Support in the Education Sector programme in Zambia. The study showed that the programme contributed to improved school culture and learning involvement. This transformation led to reduction in school dropout, as well as improved students' wellbeing and performance. These positive results motivated Zambia and other countries to integrate psychosocial support into the education systems. Community engagement, outreach activities, group forums and partnerships were the key programme methodologies that facilitated the integration process. However, limited stakeholder involvement in developing the monitoring process complicated the integration process in the initial stages. In conclusion, effectively facilitating programme integration requires ensuring that the programme is credible, inclusive and has clear implementation guidelines.

AB  - Medical doctors enjoy a high degree of professional autonomy because of their highly specialized knowledge and skills that cannot be easily scrutinized by untrained outsiders. Thus, the question of effective social supervision of medical profession remains an important issue in sociology of occupations. This study compiles government statistics, existing literature as well as fieldwork data from Beijing public hospitals to provide an analysis of the working conditions and clinic practices of medical doctors in urban China. The study finds that Chinese medical professionals are dependent on public hospitals, the dominant healthcare delivery system in China. They have no corporate autonomy enabling them to negotiate with the state over working conditions,service compensations and salary. This resulted in a distorted market value of medical professionals. However, the monopoly of public health system places hospitals and physicians in a position of control over both patients and pharmaceutical companies, making possible for doctors to turn their prescription privilege into means for personal economic gains. "Red Envelops", kickbacks and over-prescriptions become standard compensations for doctors' state regulated relatively modest salaries. This abuse of clinical autonomy by medical professionals has been pervasive and persistent in China, a clear indication of not just the failure of the state supervision and regulation but also the failure of self-monitoring professionalism. The study suggests that reforms in ending the monopoly of public healthcare system,encouraging medical professionals' participation in policy decision making process, and allowing for private practice are some of the necessary steps to deal with the problem. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] 如何对医生的执业行为实施有效的社会控制是职业社会学的一个重要问题。本文通过对我国城市医生的执业环境与执业行为的分析，指出医生仍然依附于占据医疗服务市场垄断地位的公立医院，丧失法团自主性的他们无法与国家就收入与服务补偿进行协商。但也正是由于垄断地位，公立医院及其医生获得了对患者和医药厂商的双向支配地位，可以便利地将处方权转换为经济利益。但与此同时，医生对临床自主性的这种滥用意味着卫生行政部门的监管、职业规范内化后的自律等社会控制方式的失败。本文认为，医生这一职业群体在医疗卫生政策制定过程中的参与、逐步开放医生的执业自由以及给予非公立医疗机构平等的地位与待遇等措施会使这些问题得到改观。 (Chinese) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Society: Chinese Journal of Sociology / Shehui is the property of Society: Chinese Journal of Sociology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Food safety and risks are urgent issues in the process of Chinese society’s life transition from “stuffed” (Chi bao) to “satisfying” (Chi hao). There are quite a few Christians in the field of ecological agriculture that produces safe and healthy food. This article mainly discusses the ethical practice based on faith: whether it is possible and how to solve the problem of using fake and shoddy production to mix the real ones in the process of safe and healthy food production; whether there is any possibility and how to break the “Titanic” phenomenon in the distribution of food during the process of food distribution. This article discovers and refines the “intermediate state of ethical practice” in the field work of four farms and one platform, in order to promote and supplement the recognition and understanding of ethical practice itself. Through the observation of the “intermediate state of ethical practice”, we can truly understand the meaning of Max Weber’s discussion of the possible and impossible ethical practice.

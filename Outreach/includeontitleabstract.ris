AB  - Homeless individuals with co-occurring mental and substance abuse disorders are at high risk for victimization and violence, frequently cycle between the streets, jails, and emergency rooms, and are difficult to effectively treat because of their multifaceted problems. This study evaluates Project HOPE, an intensive, integrated outreach program for this population. We found that Project HOPE effectively enrolled a highly at-risk, symptomatic group of 69 clients in treatment. However, the majority (62%) of these clients discontinued treatment in less than three months. Those who completed Project HOPE showed remarkable improvement across several domains, including more stable housing, fewer psychiatric and substance abuse problems, and better relationships. In this first study of treatment-related changes in violence and victimization for this population, we found that victimization rates decreased from 67% to 16% and violence rates decreased from 46% to 20% with treatment. Implications for developing programs that better retain clients while effectively improving their symptoms, safety, and functioning are discussed.

AB  - Reports a 3-yr follow-up study of 37 male and 6 female heroin addicts (mean age = 26 yrs) who received detoxification treatment in a community-sponsored outreach drug treatment program. Findings describe a young, predominantly black male population who were not committed to family relationships, who were introduced to heroin at an early age, who abused multiple drugs, and who had between 2 and 23 yrs of addiction before their initial contact with the program. 88% of the detoxification occurred in a residential program, 7% in an ambulatory program, and 5% was 'cold turkey.' A success rate of only 2% was obtained with detoxification, regardless of the type of facility or detoxification procedure used. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This report compiles a review of more than a decade of research and expert consensus on solutions to homelessness in the United States. This manual, published by the Departments of Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development, is for those concerned with and working to solve the problem of how to provide services to homeless persons most effectively. It is a compilation of research performed which stresses the importance of street-based outreach services to homeless individuals, intensive case management to help homeless persons gain access to treatment and maintain residential placement and techniques for building the local conditions that are needed to end homelessness. The report documents successes for working with homeless persons and acknowledges that homelessnesss is not a simple issue and that dimensions of the economy, supplies of affordable housing, disability, family support and individual characteristics all interact to affect who becomes homeless. The complexity of cause must be accommodated when researching and implementing solutions. This HUD/HHS collaborative project provides a broad and critical review of the nature of homelessness and characteristics of the homeless population; the special needs of homeless persons with disabilities; critical support services and other assistance homeless people need to become more self-sufficient; and new approaches to the problem.

AB  - The proposed longitudinal research project will compare the outcomes of homeless adolescents (ages 13-17) to the outcomes of a matched housed group of similar adolescents. The homeless sample will come from throughout the Detroit metropolitan area and will include all subgroups (e.g., ''runaways'' and ''throwaways'') to the extent that they exist in the total homeless youth population. The probability sample of 250 homeless adolescents will be sampled from 5 different types of settings: shelters for runaway/homeless youth; outreach programs for street youth and drop-in centers; in-patient and out-patient substance abuse and mental health agencies; the juvenile justice system; and soup kitchens and various street sites. The 250 matched housed adolescents will be matched on gender, age, race, and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics. Measures will be assessed longitudinally in the following domains: Family and context (e.g., parenting, violence, poverty), psychological processes (e.g., competence, self-efficacy, alcohol expectancies), homelessness and stress, utilization of social services, peer relations (e.g., deviant associations, peer support), and outcomes (e.g., alcohol and drug use/abuse, delinquency, academic achievement, mental health and suicidal proneness, physical health and HIV-risk behaviors). The principal research goals are to: (1) describe a representative sample of homeless adolescents and compare them to matched housed adolescents; (2) investigate the longitudinal consequences of adolescent homelessness; (3) test theoretical models on longitudinal pathways producing vulnerability and resilience in homeless and housed at-risk youth; (4) improve understanding of family dynamics among homeless adolescents (most of whom return home); (5) assess longitudinal differences in outcome patterns for African- vs. European-Americans and for girls vs. boys; and (6) document the effectiveness of various services used by homeless adolescents. Through extensive preliminary research, measures and sampling techniques have been refined and procedures have been developed to ensure a low attrition rate in the project's broad sample.

AB  - Purpose: By age 16, half of all adolescents use alcohol and about one-quarter use marijuana. The pervasiveness of substance abuse is remarkably higher among homeless youth as compared to the general youth population. A significant need exists to develop appropriate drug and alcohol treatment that takes into account the unique perspectives of drug use in the culture of homelessness. While predictors, such as criminal involvement, academic failure, victimization, and “street” involvement are useful in understanding substance use among homeless youth, further research on alcohol/drug dependency is needed to develop effective interventions for this population. Methods: A convenience sample of 153 homeless youth accessing services at a street outreach center participated. Those 18-23 years of age, whose case managers had identified them as drug or alcohol users, were recruited. Following informed consent, youth completed a quantitative questionnaire. Results: The sample averaged 21 years of age, were predominantly white (67.3%) and male (65.4%). Results indicated that 98.7% of these youth reported drinking alcohol, using amphetamines (39.2%), heroin (46.4%), and/or marijuana (91.5%); 57.8% of youth interviewed were identified as dependent on substances and 61.0% were dependent on alcohol. Logistic regression analyses indicated that participants who received support from substance-using street friends (OR=2.1) and were dependent on substances (OR=4.9) increased the likelihood of alcohol dependency, while the more positive youth felt about drug use (OR=.88), the more confident they were in their ability to decrease their drug use (OR=.65), or earned money by selling blood/plasma (OR=.06) decreased the likelihood of alcohol dependence (model χ2 = 63.8, p<.001). Similar analyses of drug dependence showed that those who felt changing drug use behavior was important (OR=1.3), carried a weapon (OR=3.1), or were alcohol dependent (OR=2.7) were more likely to be drug dependent (model chi-square = 49.1, p<.001). Conclusions: This study confirms the magnitude of alcohol/drug dependence among homeless youth and demonstrates the varying predictors for alcohol and drug dependency. While school-based substance use prevention programs are available for adolescents, effective programs for homeless youth are nearly non-existent and needed. This study highlights the need for service agencies proving care for these youth to assess their alcohol and drug use. Although typical drug treatment is not feasible for these agencies, developing assessment and referral mechanisms and brief interventions that target alcohol/drug issues are needed.

AB  - Until recently, teen pregnancy and birth rates had declined steadily in the United States in recent years. Despite these declines, the United States has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among all industrialized nations. To help young people reduce their risk for pregnancy and STIs, including HIV, program planners should look to the body of available evaluation and research to identify effective programs. To this end, Advocates for Youth established a set of stringent criteria for determining program effectiveness. Staff then conducted an exhaustive literature review. This paper describes 26 programs that meet the rigorous criteria. Nineteen programs appeared in "Science and Success" when it was first published in 2003; seven additional programs are included in "Science and Success, Second Edition."

AB  - Explored the mechanisms by which a well-validated intervention to prevent school failure, suspension, and teenage pregnancy produces its effects. Data were collected from 66 middle and high school sites involving 1,020 students (aged 11–19 yrs) participating in national replication of the Teen Outreach Program. Differences across sites were examined using a pre-post design and a comparison group of 1,013 age-matched students. Middle school sites that promoted student autonomy and relatedness with peers and with site facilitators achieved significantly greater levels of success in reducing problem behaviors. Offering volunteer experiences perceived as teaching middle school students new skills and leaving them real choices about the type of work they did was linked to program success. Links of program factors to site-level outcomes were found only for middle, but not high, school sites. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined a highly successful, well-documented, national program to prevent teenage pregnancy and school failure—the Teen Outreach program—to address a fundamental question: How well can a developmentally focused, broadly targeted prevention program address the needs of those students within the program who are at the highest risk of problematic behavior. The hypothesis that the developmental focus of a broadly targeted intervention would lead it to have greater program efficacy among those young people who began the program at greatest risk was examined with multisite data collected on more than 3,300 Teen Outreach and comparison group students. Results confirmed prior findings regarding the overall efficacy of the Teen Outreach program, and indicated that the program appeared most effective for those students at greatest initial risk of the problem behaviors being targeted. Implications for the targeting of the Teen Outreach program specifically and of similar primary prevention programs more generally are discussed. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Objectives. We examined whether providing active outreach and assistance to crime victims as part of comprehensive psychosocial services reduced disparities in access to state compensation funds. Methods. We analyzed data from a randomized trial of injured crime victims (N = 541) and compared outcomes from comprehensive psychosocial services with usual community care. We examined the impact of outreach and assistance on disparities in applying for victim compensation by testing for interactions between victim characteristics and treatment condition in logistic regression analyses. Results. Victims receiving comprehensive services were much more likely to apply for victim compensation than were victims receiving usual care. Comprehensive services decreased disparities associated with younger age, lower levels of education, and homelessness. Conclusions. State-level victim compensation funds are available to help individuals recover physically, psychologically, and financially from crime victimization. However, few crime victims apply for victim compensation, and there are particularly low application rates among young, male, ethnic minority, and physical assault victims. Active outreach and assistance can address disparities in access to victim compensation funds for disadvantaged populations and should be offered more widely to victims of violent crime.

AB  - Two thousand thirty-three hospital emergency room (ER) patients who were current, active injecting drug users (IDUs) were voluntary participants in a pretest, posttest research project which utilized a nursing model, the Personalized Nursing LIGHT Model, as a counseling approach to decrease high-risk AIDS behaviors. The LIGHT Model works by directly improving well-being and thereby indirectly decreasing high-risk behaviors associated with AIDS. Addicts from an urban ER in each of three cities (Detroit, Michigan; Brooklyn, New York; and Baltimore, Maryland) were treated with teams consisting of nurses and indigenous outreach workers. Posttest data were gathered on 995 of the clients who received die Personalized Nursing LIGHT Model teaching and counseling intervention. In a posttest at least 3 months after the initial interview, these IDUs reported a significant increase in well-being, r(530) = - 11.77; p < .001, and significant reductions in frequency of IV heroin use, z = -18.4;/) < .001, IV cocaine use. z = -16.0; p < .001, and IV speedball use. z = -14,3; p < ,001. as well as significant decreases in sharing of cookers (a type of drug-using equipment), z = 13.8; p < .001, and other high-risk behaviors associated with AIDS acquisition and transmission. At a second posttest at least 6 months after the initial interview, these results were unchanged.

AB  - It is possible to imagine a school designed & managed effectively for safety as well as education. Public schools, once considered a response to urban violence & disorder, now are widely believed to be hostage to them. Although broad national studies do not demonstrate a dramatic increase in school violence since the 1970s, serious violence & disorder are real for some students in some schools. Factors associated with risk are poverty, inner-city residence, enrollment in junior high school, & living in a family & community where violence is common. Physical security measures like metal detectors are only a partial solution. Curricular responses include classes in conflict resolution, self-esteem, multicultural sensitivity, & other subjects. Administrative responses include alternative schools, staff development, & efforts to alter the school culture. Community-outreach programs include principal-led committees of school, neighborhood, & city officials; joint projects with local police; & aggressive efforts to bring social services to students' families. Evaluation findings remain mixed but suggest that altering a school's internal culture can do much to reduce violence, even for schools in violent communities. 1 Table, 45 References.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Gang Prevention Through Targeted Outreach (GPTTO) and Gang Intervention Through Targeted Outreach (GITTO) initiatives of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. The study examined whether the clubs were attracting youth at high risk of gang involvement, whether clubs could keep GPTTO and GITTO youth participating in the club or program, whether GITTO and GPTTO youth were receiving positive supports through participation in the club, and whether participation had positive effects on the lives of GPTTO and GITTO youth. The evaluation involved 21 clubs that used the prevention approach and 3 that used the intervention approach. Survey results indicated that GPTTO and GITTO were meeting their goals. Clubs attracted and retained youth at high risk of gang involvement. GPTTO and GITTO youth received key developmental supports at the clubs that they might otherwise seek through involvement with gangs. Those who participated more frequently experienced positive outcomes. The estimated incremental cost per youth per year of the GPTTO and GITTO approaches were far less than the cost of gang suppression. Four appendices include sample sites; survey sample at baseline and follow-up; construct list with items, response categories, and reliability coefficients; and analytic strategies.

AB  - Pre-Referral Consultation (PRC) is a category of student referral separate from the conventional special education referral, through which any person can refer for help--any student who may be in crisis, falling through the cracks, or otherwise at risk. It exemplifies the integration of special education personnel into the general education system. This paper reviews Birmingham Groves High School's PRC program, a component of the school's outreach special education delivery system which the Michigan State Board of Education recognizes as a model program. Aspects of PRC implementation covered are: the importance of administrative support; rationale and legalities; documentation; streamlined referral process; efficient staffings; PRC team members; obtaining parent consent/involvement; interventions and alternatives; mobilization of staff; providing service; evaluation of outcomes; closure of service; and follow-up. Included in this paper are a counselor's referral packet, a pre-referral screening form to be filled out by student's general education teachers, a referral-to-placement flow chart, a description of general education driven student support service, a PRC contract/consent form, and a PRC summary report form. Potential benefits include more appropriate referrals, less time spent in meetings and writing unnecessary evaluations, improved academics, reduced numbers of disciplinary cases, improved staff morale, shared responsibility between special and general education, and the integration of special education expertise into mainstream.

AB  - There are six HIV prevention programs for homeless youth whose efficacy has been or is currently being evaluated: STRIVE, the Community Reinforcement Approach, Strengths-Based Case Management, Ecologically-Based Family Therapy, Street Smart, and AESOP (street outreach access to resources). Programs vary in their underlying framework and theoretical models for understanding homelessness. All programs presume that the youths’ families lack the ability to support their adolescent child. Some programs deemphasize family involvement while others focus on rebuilding connections among family members. The programs either normalize current family conflicts or, alternatively, provide education about the importance of parental monitoring. All programs aim to reduce HIV-related sexual and drug use acts. A coping skills approach is common across programs: Problem-solving skills are specifically addressed in four of the six programs; alternatively, parents in other programs are encouraged to contingently reward their children. Each program also engineers ongoing social support for the families and the youth, either by providing access to needed resources or by substituting a new, supportive relationship for the existing family caretaker. All of the interventions provide access to health and mental health services as basic program resources. A comparison of HIV prevention programs for homeless youth identifies the robust components of each and suggests which programs providers may choose to replicate.

AB  - THE HORNER BOYS CLUB IN CHICAGO REACHES OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND HELPS CHANNEL GANG MEMBERS INTO A CLUB SITUATION WITH CONSTRUCTIVE FORMS OF ACTIVITY. IN LOS ANGELES, A DEPUTY PROBATION OFFICER ORGANIZED A SERVICE CALLED GROUP GUIDANCE IN WHICH PROBATION OFFICERS WORK WITH THE HARD-CORE CITY GANGS THAT ARE NOT HANDLED BY CONVENTIONAL YOUTH-SERVING AGENCIES. GRANTING FUNDS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SPECIAL SCHOOLS FOR CITIZENS HAS BEEN ANOTHER AREA FORD FOUNDATION WORK. A PROGRAM TO IMPROVE EDUCATION IN DETROIT'S GRAY AREAS CONCENTRATES ON ALL THREE GROUPS INVOLVED--TEACHERS, CHILDREN, AND PARENTS. TEACHERS RECEIVE INSTRUCTION IN THE INNER WORKINGS OF GRAY-AREA NEIGHBORHOODS AND ON THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. FOR THE CHILDREN, THE DETROIT PROJECT CONCENTRATES ON BROADER CULTURAL EXPERIENCE AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN READING AND ARITHMETIC. SUCH COURSES OF INTEREST FOR PARENTS AS DRESSMAKING AND MARKETING FOR MOTHERS AND FURNITURE AND ELECTRIC REPAIR FOR FATHERS HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED IN THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS. RESEARCH IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT CONCERN OF THE FORD FOUNDATION. STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERWAY IN THE AREAS OF PUBLIC HOUSING AND SOCIAL MOBILITY, MULTI-PROBLEM FAMILIES, POLICE SEMINARS, YOUTH WORK PROGRAMS, AND TEENAGE MARRIAGES. AN EXPERIMENT IN THE REHABILITATION OF JUVENILE DELINQUENTS THROUGH INFORMAL GROUP MEETINGS AND A PROBATION SYSTEM HAS ALSO BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE FOUNDATION AND HAS PROVED NOT ONLY CHEAPER BUT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE REFORMATORY SYSTEMS.

AB  - The outreach activities component to REPSAC, an extremely successful early childhood bilingual intervention program in Clovis, New Mexico, enabled the project to provide replication services to various local education agencies requesting such services. During 1976-77, services included the training of selected teachers and aides to acquire competencies in working with young, high risk, and handicapped children. Conducted on-site at the replication centers (9 school districts and 9 Head Start Centers located in isolated areas in New Mexico) and at the parent center, training was taken to these centers by a specially designed and equipped motor coach. Evaluation of the training was conducted by an external evaluation team via objective evaluation of the workshops; classroom visits; site-visits with administrators, teachers, and aides; self-evaluation questionnaires from the trainees and trainers; and a review of various records/logs maintained by the outreach training team. A follow-up study of former REPSAC students in grades 1-5 was conducted. Findings included: the training program for the teachers and aides was extremely effective; services provided to the schools in the isolated areas were extremely needed; and the follow-up study indicated a change to an upward trend for Spanish language development, a continued slightly upward trend for English language development, and a mild downward trend for learning aptitude.

AB  - Purpose: To gain insight into client experiences with shelter or community care services for homeless people, homeless youth, and abused women and identify priority improvement areas. Methods: Seven hundred and forty-four clients rated their experiences and 116 clients rated the services' importance. Results: Clients had most positive experiences with the client-worker relationship and least positive experiences with the results of services. Abused women's service providers scored higher than homeless adults and youth service providers. Day and night shelters scored lowest, followed by crisis shelters, supported housing, and outreaching teams. The results of care have the highest need for quality improvement for homeless adults and youth. Discussion: Clients' experiences with shelter and community care services in the Netherlands are generally positive, with a strong client-worker relationship forming the basis of good quality care. Monitoring outcomes and increasing the focus on results are integrated in recent approaches aimed at improving the quality of shelter care.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this paper was to describe the Adolescent Intensive Management (AIM) team at the Austin Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS), a unique model of intensive outreach service with high-risk and difficult-to-engage adolescents, and describe the profile of clients referred to it. Method: This study used a retrospective review of clients' data, collected through file audit, over a 12-month period. Results: The result of the study showed that a 100% retention rate of adolescents with complex social, emotional and mental health needs is possible in a flexible and multi-system approach to service provision. Conclusion: Clients referred to the CAMHS' AIM team displayed a pattern of multiple risk factors and comorbidities. Low caseload of 8-10 clients per clinician allowed flexibility and a level of intensity to make any necessary changes in service provision to better suit the client's needs. The majority of clients showed improvement in functioning following intervention by the team.

AB  - We examined the immediate, short- and long-term effectiveness of the SNAP[TM] Under 12 Outreach Project (ORP)--a community-based program for children under the age of 12 at risk of having police contact. Sixteen pairs of children were matched on age, sex and severity of delinquency at admission, and randomly assigned to the ORP or to a control group which received less intensive treatment. Level of antisocial behavior was assessed pre and post intervention (immediate effects) and at three follow-up periods (up to 15 months post treatment) to investigate maintenance of possible treatment effects. A search of criminal records was also performed to assess long term effects. Results indicated that ORP children decreased significantly more than controls on the Delinquency and Aggression subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist pre- to post-intervention, and these effects were maintained over time. For statistically significant differences, effect sizes were large (0.79 to 1.19). Fewer ORP children (31%) had criminal records at follow-up compared to controls (57%), although this difference was not statistically significant. Overall, the ORP appears to be an effective cognitive-behavioral program for antisocial children in the short term, with possible effects that extend into adolescence and adulthood.

AB  - The project began in 1977 and was conducted in 9 demonstration sites as well as 21 other sites. Over 6,000 youths were served directly; over 41,000 were served indirectly. The project was funded by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and was designed to demonstrate that such youth development principles as improving feelings of belonging and competency could be systematically applied to a Boys Club program to improve its effectiveness in preventing juvenile delinquency. An independent evaluation concluded that the project succesfully recruited hard-to-reach and hard-to-serve youth through effective peer outreach. Traditional Boys Club services were most meaningful to the youth participants when they emphasized a multiservice approach and taught peer leadership skills. Effective services included outreach activities, youth employment with supervised work experience, community service, wilderness challenges, and community crime-prevention efforts planned by youths. Impact studies at each site showed that the Boys Club youth development programs reduced juvenile delinquency. After 1 year, juvenile arrest rates were reduced by 16 percent; after 3 years, by 31 percent. In 1 year alone, 1,647 arrests were prevented at a savings to taxpayers of over $3 million. Extensive training and technical assistance efforts are spreading the project's experiences to over 200 additional local clubs and over 700 staff members. Tables, descriptions of program elements and principles, financial data, and plans for activities in 1981-82 are provided.

AB  - In this study the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was used to assess the effect of counseling outcomes in a homeless population. A research gap exists in the literature on homelessness and counseling outcomes. Accordingly, this researcher investigated the effect of outreach counseling services provided by the Community Based Counseling Program (CBCP) to homeless individuals currently living in shelters and transitional housing units. The premise of this research study was that homeless individuals who participated in outreach counseling services would report decreased problem severity on the ASI in seven domains: medical, employment, drug, alcohol, legal, social, and psychiatric. A quasi-experimental research design was used. Subjects consisted of 67 homeless men and women; 31 subjects were in the treatment group and 36 subjects were in the comparison group. The treatment group composition was mainly female while the comparison group composition was mainly male. The treatment group received a pretest and posttest ASI and outreach counseling services. The comparison group received a pretest and posttest ASI and did not receive counseling services during the study. In addition, post-intervention ASI scores were examined after demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age were taken into account. The ASI was utilized to measure change scores between the treatment and comparison groups. The dependent variables were the post-ASI difference scores in medical, employment, drug, alcohol, legal, social, and psychiatric domains. The independent variable was the counseling intervention. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results from this study indicated significant differences between the treatment and comparison groups on pretest and posttest ASI social and psychiatric scores. There were non-significant changes between the treatment and comparison groups on posttest ASI medical, alcohol, drug, and legal scores. A significant correlation between employment status and age existed, with younger clients reporting greater change post-counseling than their older counterparts. Because there were differences between the groups initially with regard to gender, it was impossible to determine whether the findings were due to treatment effects or gender differences. The researcher concluded that outreach counseling contributed to measurable change in a homeless population. It is hoped that the results of this study will stimulate further investigations in the under-researched area of homelessness and counseling outcomes.

The treatment group composition was mainly female while the comparison group composition was mainly male. The treatment group received a pretest and posttest ASI and outreach counseling services. The comparison group received a pretest and posttest ASI and did not receive counseling services during the study. In addition, post-intervention ASI scores were examined after demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age were taken into account. The ASI was utilized to measure change scores between the treatment and comparison groups. The dependent variables were the post-ASI difference scores in medical, employment, drug, alcohol, legal, social, and psychiatric domains. The independent variable was the counseling intervention. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results from this study indicated significant differences between the treatment and comparison groups on pretest and posttest ASI social and psychiatric scores. There were non-significant changes between the treatment and comparison groups on posttest ASI medical, alcohol, drug, and legal scores. A significant correlation between employment status and age existed, with younger clients reporting greater change post-counseling than their older counterparts. Because there were differences between the groups initially with regard to gender, it was impossible to determine whether the findings were due to treatment effects or gender differences. The researcher concluded that outreach counseling contributed to measurable change in a homeless population. It is hoped that the results of this study will stimulate further investigations in the under-researched area of homelessness and counseling outcomes.

AB  - In 1987, the New York City Board of Education established the following three placement units responsible for improving school attendance and preventing dropping out among at-risk youth: (1) the Central Placement Unit (CPU); (2) the Persons In Need of Supervision (PINS) Diversion Unit; and (3) the Bronx District Attorney's Educational Outreach program. The overall program goal was to return out-of-school youth under agency care to public school settings and to ensure the delivery of appropriate services. During the first year of CPU-PINS's existence, the Board of Education's Office of Research, Evaluation and Assessment (OREA) examined the roles of the three program components. This paper reports on the OREA evaluation. Evaluation procedures included the following: (1) two literature reviews (included as appendices); (2) staff surveys of Board of Education and agency programs appropriate for the target population; (3) a staff questionnaire; and (4) structured interviews with all placement unit staff. The OREA evaluation found communication lacking among units, resulting in disorganization and confusion, despite documented records of re-connecting students with educational placements. Eight recommendations were forwarded for the correction of CPU-PINS problems. Appendix A reviews characteristics of at-risk youth and includes 17 references. Appendix B reviews effective placement practices and includes 12 references. (AF)

AB  - This report, the third derived from research out of the National Faith-Based Initiative (NFBI), examines how faith-based organizations designed and implemented mentoring programs for high-risk youth. Focusing on four NFBI sites (in the Bronx and Brooklyn, NY; Baton Rouge, LA; and Philadelphia, PA), the report takes up three key questions: How were the best practices of community-based mentoring programs adapted to address the specific needs of faith-based mentors and high-risk youth? How did the organizations draw on the faith community to recruit volunteers, and who came forward? And finally, how successful were the mentoring relationships--how long did they last and what potential did they show? The report is divided into six chapters. Following an introduction, Chapter II takes a brief look at the youth the sites provide with mentors. Chapter III examines the ways that faith-based programs modified their training, screening and supervision of volunteers to accommodate faith-oriented mentors and high-risk youth. The question of how successful the sites were at recruiting mentors and who they recruited are explored in Chapter IV. Finally, Chapter V examines the duration of the mentoring relationships--the only indicator to date of their potential. The authors summarize their conclusions in Chapter VI. Appended to this report are: (A) Volunteer Survey Questions; and (B) Duration of Mentoring Relationships by Site. (Contains 8 tables and 19 endnotes.) [Additional funding for this report was provided by the Vera I. Heinz Endowment.]

AB  - Mentally disordered criminal offenders (forensic patients) under Ontario Review Board Orders were treated using either a team approach or a newer outreach approach. The approaches were compared using the clinical files of 60 male subjects. Results indicated that the outreach approach reduced hospitalization time, and was more likely to be used with high risk patients. High risk was associated with recidivism and substance abuse. Time spent on Review Board Orders was decreased by independent living, and by age at the time of the offence. Patients with schizophrenia were found to be younger at the time offence than those with bipolar disorder. In summary, the outreach approach is an effective means of treating forensic patients, and re-integrating them into the community.

AB  - A 5-year follow-up study was performed on 82 homeless men, with mental problems, who had been contacted by an outreach team run by the Social welfare administration of Stockholm 1995/1996. Data have been collected from the Cause of Death Register, death certificates, forensic autopsy reports, hospital medical reports, Hospital Discharge Register, interviews with social workers and with those men who were able to participate. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 4.7 times higher than expected. The highest mortality was found in the group where drug addiction was dominant; 46% had died. In the group of men with severe psychiatric disorders, with diagnosis such as schizophrenia, none had died. Compared with the others, they had spent less time in homelessness. Among the survivors, 75% were still homeless at the follow-up in spite of considerable treatment interventions from the social services and health authorities. Residential institutions or treatment seemed to have some protective effect concerning misuse, diseases and injuries. Among the still homeless, the mental health problems combined with substance use problems had increased with 17%. The life and housing situation for the whole group seemed not to have improved, even if fewer of them were staying in hostels for homeless people.

AB  - The authors provide examples of sports-based youth development programs and offer information about program mission and vision, program design and content, evaluation results, and program sustainability. The four sports-based youth development programs presented are Harlem RBI, Tenacity, Snowsports Outreach Society, and Hoops & Leaders Basketball Camp. These programs serve diverse audiences with diverse missions, but all are focused on using sports to develop life skills and facilitate learning. Harlem RBI serves boys and girls ages seven to eighteen living in East Harlem. The program combines baseball, academic, and enrichment programs with the overall goal that participants who enter the program as vulnerable children graduate as resilient young adults. Tenacity, a nonprofit organization with headquarters in Boston, uses tennis to attract and retain students who participate in a high-quality academic support and physical fitness program. The mission of Snowsports Outreach Society, based in Vail, Colorado, is building character in at-risk and underprivileged youth to develop their decision-making ability for healthy and successful life experiences. Hoops & Leaders Basketball Camp is a youth mentoring and leadership development program that offers summer camp experiences to improve the lives of at-risk urban youth in New York City. It uses the game of basketball to provide youth with caring mentors, develop leadership skills, and offer exposure to different educational and career paths.

AB  - The packet's first section describes the planning and implementation of the Red Hook Community Justice Center, a neighborhood-based court currently in development in southwest Brooklyn. The planning 'diary' offers lessons from a crucial moment in its development, i.e., the early stages of planning. The second section of the packet draws lessons from the Midtown Community Court, which is located on 54th Street in Manhattan; it is the first neighborhood-based court in New York City since the city's courts centralized in 1962. This section uses the experiences of the Midtown Community Court as a starting point for a broader discussion of the potential impact of neighborhood- based courts on the criminal justice system. It advises that when courts engage in unfamiliar practices, they also raise new concerns about due process, the adversarial system, and the independence of the judiciary. The next section of the packet focuses on the street outreach services of the Midtown Community Court. Under this program, experienced court workers accompanied by police officers identify likely prospects for court services, introduce themselves, describe the services available at the court, and explain where it is and when it is open. Another section of the packet is a guide for community court planners in engaging the community in the planning and implementation process. This is followed by a section that discusses the origins, expectations, and implementation of the Hartford Community Court (Connecticut). Other sections of the packet contain an executive summary of the implementation and effects of the Midtown Community Court; lessons from the Red Hook Youth Court; a design packet that contains concepts of community court design; and a catalog that offers tools, advice, and resources for community courts.

AB  - This paper reports on an experiment to test youth employment as a tactic for delinquency prevention. Features of jobs that should cause young people to develop a stake in doing well are described. Three elements of the bond to work that enable the work experience to reduce delinquency are identified: commitment, attachment, and belief. Various organizational arrangements are suggested that support youth investment in work, including the design of the job, recruitment and hiring procedures, training, instruction, evaluation, and feedback methods. Supportive services that will increase the probability that the jobs will be viewed positively by youth and adults are detailed. The form an experiment in youth employment might take is then described. Topics include the characteristics of these programs that distinguish them from typical youth employment programs; the various forms that these projects might take; the components of the youth employment system, the interests and concerns of each of the members, and tactics that might be used to draw others into the venture; and elements that appear to be important to the success or failure of change efforts.

AB  - This article proposes an alternative to zero tolerance policies without compromising school safety and introduces an approach to fostering academic success and emotional and mental health in the schools within a relational and developmental context. The RALLY program (Responsive Advocacy for Life and Learning in Youth), dealing with high-risk youth, many with serious psychological and social problems, is an in-school prevention and intervention program combining mental health and educational practice to support students' progress both in and outside the classroom. Teachers and students can work better together when added supports are in place. The effectiveness of this program has led to work to change traditional views of mental health and education and to work to convince policymakers to push for larger changes. Teachers cannot be expected to serve as mental health practitioners, family and community outreach workers, and mentors in today's environment of increased risk factors without seriously compromising their own quality of life or the quality of their students' education.

AB  - Student financial assistance has long been a means to promote access to postsecondary education and attainment of college degrees. Numerous types of financial aid programs have proliferated over the years, including a relatively new concept that specifically targets high-risk, low-income students, focusing not just on getting them to go to college but also increasing the chance of their earning a degree. "Early commitment" financial aid programs are designed to provide economically disadvantaged students in middle school and early high school with a guarantee of financial aid for postsecondary education if they meet certain requirements, including successful completion of a rigorous college-prep curriculum. Since affordability and academic preparation are considered the greatest barriers to higher education for low-income students, early commitment initiatives seek to provide a solution to both problems. This paper looks at different types of early commitment programs, summarizes relevant research, and suggests guidelines for future programs. Finally, this paper suggests a few guidelines for state leaders considering new early commitment programs, based on existing models and available research: (1) "Be clear about program goals and expectations" to ensure the program design clearly reflects the three core criteria suggested earlier; (2) "Consider linking early notification and qualification" for other federal programs, such as Medicaid or free and reduced-fee school lunch programs, to establish reliable eligibility; (3) "Provide for fiscal sustainability" by forecasting future demand and persistence; (4) "Require periodic assessment" to increase understanding of a program's impact; (5) "Invest in support and outreach programs," including academic and general college preparation, marketing, parent participation, and other support services; and (6) "Explore public-private partnerships" as a means of co-sponsorship of initiatives by government, business, foundations, and communities. Appended are: (1) Program Pledges or Requirements; (2) Selected Program Profiles from the Pathways to College Network. (Contains 54 endnotes.)

AB  - Job training and support services for homeless individuals served by the Job Training for the Homeless Demonstration Program exceeded planned levels of participants served, trained, and placed, according to the report. Almost 50 percent more than planned, or approximately 4,600 participants in the program, received job training; nearly 15 percent more than originally expected, or 2,400, were placed in unsubsidized jobs; and 40 percent of those placed were still working after 3 weeks on the job, according to the report. Direct placement in jobs, reliance on subsidized employment and the incorporation of an extended stabilization or recovery period are examples of approaches that may be required to meet the diverse employment and training needs of homeless persons. The demonstration consisted initially of 32 projects in 21 States and D.C. It is authorized by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act and administered by the Department of Labor.

AB  - The Open Studio Project (OSP) is a nonprofit arts and social service organization. This report presents the OSP process as a model of social action. It describes how the model was implemented in a particular community to address a need for arts programs for at risk youth. "Art & Action," an outreach program of OSP, became a unique year round after school and summer program that catered to the diverse needs of the participating youth. The advocacy efforts that emerged from the OSP method of using intention, artmaking, witness writing, and sharing, along with no commenting and no forced participation, are presented. Its relevance to the field of art therapy and the implications for practice are also considered.

AB  - Research and policy (e.g., Carnegie Council, 1992) have shown the importance and benefit of programs that supplement the education system, particularly among children living in high-risk environments. These programs have traditionally used an activity-based approach where the activity is central to the program's design. This article presents the concept of relationship-based programming, a perspective that places a greater emphasis on the ability to build and solidify a healthy relationship between a youth worker and participants using the program or activity as a medium. The authors present this issue based upon three years of case studies and a year-long ethnographic study, which examined the impact of a Roving Leader youth outreach program run by a Park and Recreation Department. The program was designed to serve youth identified as "hard to reach" and whom other community resources were not serving. A critical component of the program was the importance of the relationships established between leaders and participants as opposed to the activities in which they participated. Several elements were critical to this process: being multi-faceted and flexible, involved and able to make connections, consistent, compassionate, empathetic, and patient. Taking a relationship-based approach has considerable implications for youth program designers as they attempt to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse youth population.

AB  - APPROXIMATELY 35 PERCENT OF THIS CLUSTER EVALUATION EFFORT WAS EXPENDED IN DEVELOPING AN EVALUATION STRATEGY AND A SET OF INSTRUMENTS. THE EVALUATION STRATEGY WAS BASED UPON A GENERAL DRUG EDUCATION AND PREVENTION-MODEL. THIS MODEL IDENTIFIES FIVE ACTIVITIES IN WHICH PROJECTS ENGAGE (PREVENTIVE EDUCATION, ONGOING COUNSELING, OUTREACH COUNSELING, TRAINING SCHOOL STAFF AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION) AND A HIERARCHY OF IMMEDIATE, INTERMEDIATE AND ULTIMATE OBJECTIVES. EIGHT QUESTIONNAIRES AND EIGHT RECORDS-BASED INSTRUMENTS WERE DEVELOPED TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARD THESE OBJECTIVES. THE BULK OF THE CLUSTER EVALUATION EFFORT WAS THEN SPENT IMPLEMENTING THIS METHODOLOGY FOR THE CLUSTER PROJECTS. WHILE NO CONSISTENT EVIDENCE WAS FOUND TO INDICATE THAT ANY OF THE PROJECTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING DRUG USE OR MISUSE, SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON INTERVENTION CLIENTS WERE FOUND IN SIX INTERMEDIATE AREAS: HANDLING RESPONSIBILITY, GAINING SELF-CONFIDENCE, IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS, COMMUNICATING BETTER DECISIONS AND CLARIFYING VALUES. FURTHER, THE PROJECTS HAD VERY FAVORABLE IMAGES WITH BOTH YOUTHS AND ADULTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. FOR THE 21 DAY STATUS REPORT AND APPENDIXES TO THE FINAL EVALUATION SEE NCJ-15564 AND NCJ-15566.

AB  - Introduction and Aims. Despite substantial health disadvantage, few intervention studies have examined ways to deliver smoking cessation support to homeless people. This proof-of-concept study explored the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, low-cost, telephone-delivered program. Design and Methods. Clients aged over 18 years, English-speaking and currently receiving accommodation support from a homelessness outreach centre were invited to participate in a 'Phone for Health' program. Six sessions conducted once per week provided participants with personalised counselling about smoking cessation or reduction, as well as fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol use, physical activity and sun protection. Both clients and staff completed follow-up quantitative surveys, and clients completed qualitative interviews. Results. Of 14 eligible participants, 12 consented to taking part and completed baseline measures, 10 commenced the telephone intervention and six completed the intervention program. Average length of telephone sessions was 17.8 min and participants completed an average of 3.8 sessions. Findings suggested high acceptability with most participants reporting that the Phone for Health program helped them meet their smoking reduction goals, and was convenient, useful and practical. Most participants reported making changes to their health risk behaviours as a result of taking part in the program. Discussion and Conclusions. Telephone delivery of the smoking cessation and other health behaviours intervention was acceptable and feasible. The results provide pragmatic lessons for the development of future health research and practice with an underserved population markedly difficult to reach and engage.[Bonevski B, Baker A, Twyman L, Paul C, Bryant J.

AB  - Assessed the effect of client characteristics and community interventions on treatment entry and retention, and evaluated the relative effectiveness of treatment, compared to other interventions, in reducing drug use and crime among out-of-treatment opiate injectors. 2,973 Ss (mean age 38.8 yrs) from 15 US cities were randomly assigned to: standard intervention (SI)—HIV testing and counseling; or enhanced intervention (EI)—SI plus additional educational sessions stressing responsible drug use. EI in some cities included staff assistance with treatment admission. All locations provided intervention by community outreach workers. Factors positively associated with treatment entry included: prior treatment, intervention by community workers, assignment to the EI, not injecting cocaine, injecting opiates, and fewer program interventions received. Sites where the EI included active referral achieved significantly higher treatment entry rates than sites where the EI did not. Findings supported the efficacy of treatment over other interventions in reducing drug use and arrests, the addition of staff assistance to facilitate clients' entry into treatment, and the involvement of community outreach workers in achieving treatment entry.

AB  - The San Francisco, California– based HIV Homeless-Health Outreach Mobile Engagement (HHOME) program aims to improve health and housing outcomes for multiply diagnosed people experiencing chronic homelessness whom the HIV care system has failed to reach. From 2014 to 2017, HHOME’s mobile multidisciplinary team served 106 clients. Viral suppression increased from 23.6% to 60%, and 73.8% obtained permanent supportive housing (n = 61). System-level changes included the adoption of citywide standardized acuity assessment toolsHIV Care Coordination Taskforce by community partners. This article highlights HHOME’s core components and its public health implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This twelve-year study evaluated the effectiveness of a therapeutic community for young men who had been abused in a range of ways, and had themselves become sexually harmful, usually to children. Each young man was interviewed on arrival at the community, at their departure two years later, and thereafter at one-year intervals. Annual findings were relayed to the community on an action research basis, with recommendations such as an extended ex-resident outreach service, being implemented. 'Before and after' checklists revealed significant reductions in factors such as self-harm, suicidal thoughts and depression by the end of their stay in the community. Coping mechanisms, which they had acquired as residents, allowed the majority to manage post-leaving challenges including housing, employment, and family relations. Ministry of Justice re/conviction rates proved to be low as against those of a comparison group.

AB  - This study explored how the non-profit organization PoCoMo Youth Services Society (PoCoMo) can become more effective in best serving at-risk youth through their Mobile Outreach Program. Using an action research approach, this study provides PoCoMo with an opportunity to address some key issues that affect its ability to implement mobile outreach services to at-risk youth. It looks at change leadership as a crucial element in maintaining and securing organizational soundness, community connectivity, and program development. However, little information is collected on mobile outreach programs to better understand how to best serve at-risk youth populations and the role organizations play in implementing support services. This action research project investigates the needs, interventions, support services, and fostering collaborative relationship characteristics needed to create a sustainable outreach model for at-risk youth. Moreover, this report identifies model-efficiencies, potential for relationship-building, increased leadership capacity, and overall outreach program development.

AB  - Abstract: Background: California Prevention Education Program (Cal-Pep) provides street outreach services to injection drugs users and sex traders in Oakland and San Francisco, CA, to reduce their chances of contracting HIV/AIDS. Drug treatment is an effective barrier to HIV infections, but only clients who are ready for total abstinence from drug use can be referred to traditional treatment. Drug treatment readiness is currently defined by funding policies in the U.S. as a client''s willingness to totally abstain from alcohol and illegal drug use. This policy and practice eliminates a major harm reduction opportunity to reach drug users who are just contemplating recovery with treatment. With a CSAT grant to demonstrate an effective innovation in treatment, Cal-Pep started a harm reduction outpatient program for women who were active drug users. Over the course of 1 year, actively drug-using clients came to the program house during the day for meals, for risk-reduction education sessions, group discussions, and one-on-one psychological counselling. Method: From April 2001 to March 2006, 37 clients per year were interviewed at program entry and after 6 and 12 months to see if the intervention activities had an impact on their drug use and readiness for abstinence drug treatment. Results: By the 6th and 12th month of clients’ progression through the risk-reduction program, they reported a statistically significant reduction in their poly-drug use (cocaine, cannabis, heroin, PCP) in the 30 days prior to their interviews (p <.000). There were also significant reductions in poly-drug use with alcohol (p <.000) and use of crack cocaine alone (p <.003). There was also an added benefit: clients significantly improved their living circumstances from the streets and shelters to rooms and apartments while in the program (p <.034). There was no significant improvement in employment. Conclusion: This intervention shows that a harm reduction intermediate treatment program for actively using drug users can significantly reduce their drug use and improve readiness for full recovery.

AB  - MORE was a mobile outreach drug abuse prevention and HIV harm reduction program primarily for ex-offenders who are active drug users. Through case management, clients were provided substance abuse education, counseling, and referral. Long term goals of these services were to reduce their drug use and re-incarceration for drug related crimes. From January 2002 to May 2006, 487 unduplicated clients were recruited in year long cohorts and offered services. The program evaluation tool was the Federal Office of Budget and Management Government Performance and Results Act questionnaire. Government Performance and Results Act interviews were conducted at in-take into the program, approximately six months later and again approximately 12 months after their initial in-take. By the six and 12 month follow-up interviews, active drug using clients reported significant reductions in their use of alcohol, cocaine/crack, heroin, and fewer sex partners and crimes. Program completers reported significantly reduced cocaine/crack and heroin use as well as fewer days in jail and crimes than non-completers (p < .01 to .001). Six program components account for these reductions: case management, day-treatment, outpatient services, outreach, HIV/AIDS, and substance abuse education. The differences in program service intensity, income, and employment for program completers and non-completers were analyzed using logistic regression. The intensity of case management and all services received along with having higher income by month six were the most significant predictors of program completion.

AB  - Of 4,525 youths who were initially tracked through Targeted Outreach, 21 percent had a history of prior involvement with juvenile justice authorities; 92 percent did not show behavior warranting the involvement of juvenile justice officers while they were involved in Targeted Outreach activities. At school, 39 percent of participants demonstrated positive changes in their school work, and two- thirds continued to be involved in Targeted Outreach for the duration of the tracking period. Procedures for implementing a Targeted Outreach program are described according to four major areas: (1) understanding juvenile delinquency and juvenile delinquency prevention; (2) key elements of juvenile delinquency prevention efforts; (3) planning the program approach; and (4) resources. Sample program activities and forms are included, and an appendix defines juvenile justice terminology.

AB  - More than 1,100 local clubs provide activities for 1.4 million boys and girls nationwide. Typically, club members live in large or medium-sized cities, have three or more siblings, are from minority populations, and have families whose annual income is less than $12,000. Experiences provided by BGCA help youth develop leadership skills and lay the foundation for success in later life. Results indicate that clubs have a positive impact on the lives of young people, especially those from disadvantaged families. Club alumni report that the BGCA experience helped them avoid difficulty with the law and provided a support system against drug abuse. Club activities, such as sports, exercise, and other group activities, provide staff with excellent vehicles for teaching members teamwork, responsibility, and leadership. BGCA's involvement in public housing communities began more than 37 years ago. Clubs that operate cooperatively with local public housing authorities have played a critical role in reducing vandalism, curbing gang violence and drug activity, and giving youth a sense of belonging and purpose. The BGCA's Task Force on Inappropriate Detention was created in 1981 with technical assistance from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. A special Targeted Outreach Case Management System has been developed that tracks youths' progress and participation in club activities designed to prevent juvenile delinquency. The Targeted Outreach Youth Gang Prevention and Intervention Program is a new initiative being built on BGCA's Targeted Outreach Program. Another program, known as SMART Moves, is a community-based program to help adolescents say no to drug use and early sexual activity. Other BGCA initiatives include Reaching At-Risk Youth in Public Housing and a drug demand reduction program.

AB  - Background: High proportions of homeless individuals have mental illness and substance use disorders. Few of these individuals engage in consistent treatment, although they are likely to benefit from it. Shelter-based interventions to help this population engage in treatment have not been studied in a rigorous manner. Objectives: We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a shelter-based intervention, including intensive outreach by a psychiatric social worker and availability of weekly psychiatrist visits with continuity of care to engage homeless individuals with psychiatric and substance use problems. Research Design: This was a randomized controlled trial. Subjects: A total of 102 individuals were referred to a shelter-based psychiatric clinic. Measures: The primary outcome measure was first appointment attendance at a community mental health center (CMHC). Secondary outcome measures were attendance at second and third CMHC appointments, participation in a substance abuse program, and employment and housing status at shelter exit. Results: Individuals receiving the intervention were more likely to attend ≥1 CMHC appointment (64.7% versus 37.3%, P = 0.006) and to participate in a substance abuse program (51.4% versus 12.5%, P = 0.0006) than those in the control group. There was a trend towards being more likely to attend 2 CMHC visits (33.3% versus 17.7%, P = 0.083), but no significant differences in attending 3 visits, being employed, or having housing. Conclusions: Shelter-based interventions hold promise for improving treatment engagement in homeless populations with psychiatric and substance use problems. Further study should address how to foster care beyond an initial CMHC appointment and clarify key program components using a wider range of outcome measures.

AB  - Problem: Barriers, including distance and lack of transport, make it difficult for young people to access mental health services such as headspace. Design: A collaborative mental health outreach service initiative with outcome measures assessed at baseline and after 2 years. Setting: The service was designed and implemented by headspace Hobart and Pulse Youth Health Service based in Glenorchy, Tasmania, Australia. Key measures for improvement: Number of rural and socio‐economically disadvantaged young people accessing the outreach service.Wait time to see a mental health clinician. Strategies for change: Organisational leadership and adoption of co‐design principles. Staff and youth from both services were engaged in planning and implementation. Regular service reviews were undertaken by representatives from both organisations. Effects of change: Numbers of young people from rural and socio‐economically disadvantaged areas accessing the service increased. Wait times to see a mental health clinician were reduced by a minimum 10 working days. Lessons learnt: Staff engagement was vital in supporting and promoting the new outreach service. The risk of diluting the headspace model fidelity was ameliorated by collaborating with an existing, complimentary youth health service. The success of the service has resulted in four more outreach sites. Although administration resources are stretched, the outreach model offers an opportunity to increase access to youth‐friendly mental health services for young people from disadvantaged and rural areas of Southern Tasmania.

AB  - CONTEXT: The use of peer providers in family planning clinics has been proposed as a strategy that could better serve sexually active adolescent populations. METHODS: Baseline and follow-up survey data from 1,424 female and 166 male adolescent clients of five California community health clinics were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of a peer provider model between 1996 and 1999. Multivariable analyses examined differences in outcomes between clients' first and last clinic visits, and by whether clients received only clinical services or other components of the model (outreach and telephone follow-up) as well. RESULTS: Female clients were significantly more likely at their last visit than at their first visit to report consistent birth control use (odds ratio, 1.9), use at last intercourse (1.8) and use of effective methods (3.5), and were significantly less likely to report consistent condom use (0.7). There were no significant differences in male birth control or condom use between first and last visits. Females who received all components of the model were more likely than those who received only clinical services to return for an annual exam (2.2) and to make three or more visits during the study period (1.7). The full model was particularly effective for females who were Hispanic, had been born to adolescent mothers or had had more than one sexual partner in the six months before their first clinic visit. CONCLUSIONS: The peer provider model appears to be a promising addition to the mix of service delivery models, particularly for certain subgroups of clients. The findings underscore the importance of tailoring programs on the basis of clients' risk profiles.

AB  - This evaluation study investigated the clinical outcomes of children and adolescents served in a partial hospitalization program and included archival chart reviews, follow-up interviews, and surveys. Subjects included children and adolescents with 269 in the total study group and 132 in the follow-up group. As a means of determining outcomes, this study examined characteristics of children and adolescents treated and their follow-up status along a range of dimensions. Distinct clinical groups were identified based on those who experienced suicidal episodes and those who did not. Results indicate most admissions to be one-time admissions, with adolescent females composing most of the admissions and readmissions. Support for expected findings were found in the areas of: (a) more restrictive placements among males with co-occurring disorders and substance use; (b) suicide episodes most common among females, those with co-occurring disorders, clinical depression and substance use; and (c) high satisfaction and perceived improvement. Unexpected findings were found in the areas of: (a) high utilization of the program by children and adolescents in State's custody with substance abuse problems; (b) more restrictive placements among the non-suicide episode group; and (c) no outstanding differences between parents who responded to the initial study contact and those who needed outreach contacts to participate in the study. Limitations of this study and recommendations for future program evaluation are discussed.

AB  - The Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program (HPRP) was a federally-funded program in the United States that provided short-term financial and support services to individuals and families who were at-risk or currently experiencing homelessness. There is limited research on factors that predict placement in permanent housing following prevention and rapid rehousing interventions, particularly for single adult populations. The present study examined demographic and program-related predictors of permanent housing upon program exit among two groups of adults enrolled in HPRP in Indianapolis, IN: Homelessness Prevention (HP) recipients (n = 219) and Rapid Re-housing (RRH) recipients (n = 296). Results revealed that 76.3% of HP and 68.8% of RRH recipients were living in permanent housing when they exited HPRP. For HP recipients, completion of HPRP and outreach and engagement services were significant predictors of remaining in permanent housing. For RRH recipients, individuals who were African American, did not have a disabling condition, completed HPRP, received a greater amount of financial assistance, and received case management services had significantly greater odds of permanent housing. Findings have implications for informing short-term housing support programs for precariously housed or homeless single adults and highlight the need for future research on prevention and rehousing interventions.

AB  - Non-injecting heroin users (NIHU) who transition to drug injection will help shape the future course of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the spread of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) in the U.S. We examine (1) the extent of former injection drug use among young NIHU, (2) the incidence and predictors of injection transitions, and (3) the prevalence, incidence, and risk of HIV, HBV and HCV infections. NIHU 16-30 years old were recruited in Chicago through street outreach and respondent-driven methods for a prospective cohort study. Computerized self-administered interviews collected self-report data at baseline and subsequent follow-up visits scheduled at 6-month intervals for up to 3 years. Logistic regression analysis assessed factors associated with history of injection at baseline. Person-time methods estimated incidence rates and Cox proportional hazards regression examined predictors of transitions to injection and HIV, HBV, and HCV seroconversions. Of 689 NIHU, 51.2% were non-Hispanic(NH) Black, 64.4% male, and the median age was 25. Former injection was reported by 17.9% and of those, 66.7% injected <10 times. At follow-up, 561 (81.4%) returned for ≥1 visit. Transition to drug injection during follow-up was reported by 154 (27.5%, rate 14.7 per 100 person-years[py]) participants. The rate was significantly (p<0.001) higher among former injectors compared to never injectors. Multivariable analysis identified individual, drug use, and social factors that predicted injection transitions among young NIHU. Finally, of those initially at risk for infection, 1 (0.2%, rate 0.08 per 100py) participant seroconverted for HIV during follow-up, 11(2.6%, rate 1.2 per 100py) for HBV and 27 (5.0%, rate 2.3 per 100py) for HCV. Those with greater sexual risk exposure were at increased risk for HIV and HBV, and those who transitioned to injection at follow-up were at high-risk for HCV seroconversion. We detected a high rate of transitions to injection among young NIHU. The risk of injection was greatest among former injectors and NH-Whites, and least among NH-Blacks. Furthermore, we report individual, drug behavior and social factors that identify at-risk users and that can be used for developing intervention programs aiming to prevent injection and the transmission of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections among drug users.

AB  - Peer counselors can be a highly effective means of counseling in academic institutions. Peer counselors are used at the University of California, San Diego in the Academic Success Program. The targeted students to be helped are from economically or socially disadvantaged backgrounds and/or minority groups. This program was designed to ensure high-risk students success and retention rates. Trained student paraprofessionals (peer counselors) facilitate other students' success. Training is provided to potential peer counselors in a course entitled "The Psychology of Teaching". The class includes skills development, formation of counseling skills, conflict management, establishing relationships, and sensitivity to issues of ethnic students. A practicum component involves role playing and skill practice. Selection of counselors is based on maturity, communication skills, and understanding of the program's goals and commitment. Once selected, counselors receive further training in intervention skills, cardiopulmonary resusitation, team building, campus services, and program goals. Peer counselors help students with academic choices, financial aid, work-study opportunities, and housing clients. Academic progress is monitored and academic support is arranged when needed. Difficult problems are referred to the coordinator. Client students appreciate the help and peer counselors experience personal growth. (ABL)

AB  - Since 1988 a 24-hr psychiatric outreach service has been in operation in the inner city of Sydney, Australia, to provide services to residents of homeless shelters. A total of 506 homeless persons with schizophrenia were referred to the outreach service between April 1988–mid-1992, of whom 91 failed to attend. Hospitalization data were collected for the 4 yrs before and the 4 yrs after each individual's referral to the service. After introduction of the service, the rate and duration of psychiatric hospital admissions for residents with schizophrenia who were treated by the outreach service decreased significantly, whereas those who failed to attend showed no such decrease.

AB  - This pilot study evaluated the effects of a brief suicide prevention training. The intervention was efficient and targeted peer intervention for those least likely to engage in proactive help seeking on their own behalf. The results were promising but mixed. The results showed that the intervention can increase suicide literacy and confidence about safety planning and help seeking on behalf of an at-risk peer. Significant differences were found in the small sample with variables most relevant to the ability to recognize peers at risk for suicide and act effectively on their behalf. Variables not directly emphasized in the training and those with high baseline scores did not show change. The brevity of the intervention lends itself to potential dissemination opportunities in educational and healthcare settings such as new student orientations, teacher in-service trainings, hospital staff training and community-based outreach.

AB  - Belafonte-Tacolcy Center is among the most prevention-oriented of the programs presented in this text. Offering comprehensive services that span a wide developmental continuum from pre-school-aged children to young adults, the Center functions as a community center or 'clubhouse,' with additional programs provided in local schools. All phases of a youth's development are addressed through a mix of educational, counseling, recreational, vocational, and leadership training activities. Its programs primarily target the children and youth themselves and secondarily target parents, who participate in individual counseling, group meetings, and workshops. This chapter profiles the Belafonte-Tacolcy Center as an example of comprehensive service integration. The initiatives mission, goals, and objectives; current clientele; service configuration; service integration network type and make-up; funding sources; and involvement in evaluation activities are all examined. Further, a 1996 update shows that Belafonte-Tacolcy has continued to move forward since the authors visited the agency in 1992. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - GEAR UP (Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs) emerged in the late 1990s as a comprehensive outreach program seeking to enhance awareness of and readiness for college among low-income middle school students. After controlling for students' preprogram test scores and school characteristics, findings indicate that students participating in GEAR UP and in a comparison group gained in their reading and mathematics test scores. Analyses, however, found no statistically significant 2-year effects of program participation on students' reading scores, although a slight, nonsignificant trend across the study period suggested some closing of the statistically significant gap between the 2 groups in the baseline year.

AB  - The problem of families' limited access to community early childhood services and information was addressed in this practicum. Negative outcomes for young children and their families in a northeastern city were attributed to difficulties in locating and providing services for the developmental needs of children between birth and age 5. The children were at risk for (1) substandard care; (2) abuse, neglect, or heightened family stress; and (3) school failure. The practicum aimed to help families negotiate services through a community-based referral procedure that used a "warm line" format. A key feature of the procedure was the outreach method, which used informal kinship and friendship networks, formal networks, and conventional public service announcements. The pluralistic nature of the community demanded diverse, holistic strategies. Outreach, coordination, and human resource development were other features of the implementation. The results were positive. Difficult-to-reach families responded to the outreach, received information, and shared it in their informal networks. Planning efforts that represented community needs were initiated. Eighty requests were processed through the procedures, and steps toward advocacy were taken through an early childhood services network. Appendices contain advertisements of nanny and child care listings, a survey pertaining to family matters, a referral form and log, a form for a weekly journal, letters, responses to implementation, and other related materials. Contains about 100 references. (Author/LB)

AB  - The project was established under the Homeless Youth Act. Grants for pilot projects in Los Angeles County and the city and county of San Francisco were awarded on July 1, 1986. In San Francisco, shelter agencies served 3,375 youth yet turned away 233, almost half of whom were 15 years old or younger. Sixteen percent of those sheltered and 44 percent of those seen by outreach had a history of abuse and neglect, while 44 percent were chronic runaways or homeless. Only 30 percent were good candidates for reunification with their families. In Los Angeles, the shelter agencies served 4,861 youth while turning away 5,784; Forty-five percent of those sheltered had a history of abuse or neglect. Only 20 percent were good candidates for family reunification. Results demonstrate the need for continued support for emergency services for homeless youth. Tables and appended legislation are included.

AB  - This monograph describes Project START (Support To Affirm Rising Talent), a three-year collaborative research effort to develop and apply gifted identification procedures based on Howard Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences. Specifically, the study attempted to: (1) develop identification procedures; (2) identify high-potential primary age students from culturally diverse and/or low economic backgrounds using the multiple intelligences model; (3) investigate the reliability and validity of the identification procedures; and (4) test the efficacy of specific interventions on student achievement and attitudes about school and self. Identified students were assigned to one of three conditions: an experimental condition involving modification of classroom activities and a family outreach program; an experimental condition involving modification of classroom activities, a family outreach program, and a mentorship; and a control group. Findings of the qualitative and quantitative study are grouped into the following categories: psychometric properties of the assessment tools; achievement, attitude, and self-concept; teacher changes during the project; outcomes for students and their families; elements of the program found to be most effective; and other qualitative findings. Two appendices include a project lesson development flow chart and classroom observation protocols. (Contains approximately 225 references.) (DB)

AB  - Introduction: The Innovations project 15 to 25 years (IP) was a new multidisciplinary team based within an inner city area, walk-in health centre, in the North East of England (funded from January to December 2011) developed to provide a service to identify, assess and treat HTRYP. This research project draws data from the IP and compares them to data collected from a Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) in the North East of England. Aims: Initial Phase: to describe the mental health and evaluate the outcomes (mental disorder and social function) of the HTRYP who attended the IP. Phase 1: to compare the baseline demographics (Time Point 1 (TP1)) between a matched sample of IP and a sample of YP from CMHT. Phase 2: to identify and compare the indices for severity, complexity, engagement and response to treatment in a matched sample of IP and CMHT sample at TP1 and pre-discharge (TP2). Phase 3: to assess the mental state and social function of a group of individuals from the IP and CMHT samples who were retraced and agreed to be interviewed (24 months after discharge), TP3. Methods: Phase 1 and 2: a retrospective review of the clinical case notes of the YP who attended the IP (HTRYP) and CMHT was conducted. For Phase 1 the CMHT were matched to the HTRYP on age and date of discharge. The demographic characteristics of the two samples at TP1 were compared. For Phase 2 the samples were additionally matched for; gender, highest level of educational attainment and socioeconomic status. For phase 2 the focus was on severity of mental disorder and service input and change from TP1 to TP2 and between both services. Data were analysed using SPSS version 21. Phase 3 provided a follow up evaluation of the mental state and social function of YP who attended IP and CMHT (change was assessed using the Health of the Nation Outcome Scales for Child and Adolescent Mental Health (HoNOSCA) and the Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). For this phase the samples used for retracing were further matched for primary diagnosis and severity of mental disorder at TP1. Results: Forty referrals were received by the IP service from a variety of agencies. Four referrals were not appropriate. An assessment was offered to 36, five refused. Of the 31 (86%) YP who were assessed all met the criteria for HTRYP, nine repeatedly missed appointments and seven were judged not to be suffering from complex mental disorders and were signposted to local community services. 15 (48%) were then offered individually tailored therapy. In Phase 1 significant differences at TP1 were found between the 36 HTRYP and 115 CMHT samples. The IP group experienced significantly more severe deprivation (t142= -5.6, p=<0.0001), higher rates A case control and follow up study of ‘Hard to Reach’ young people who also suffered from multiple complex mental disorders v Dr Nigel Camilleri of unemployment (χ²2 =16.696, p<0.0002) and homelessness (Wx= 1, 23.812, p < 0.001) and achieved poorer educational attainment (Wx=4, 27.485, p < 0.001) compared to the CMHT sample. In Phase 2, at baseline the HTRYP (median 3, CMHT median 1, χ24= 31.58, P<0.001) had more mental disorders, higher severity scores and lower levels of social function than YP attending CMHT (HTRYP HoNOSCA mean score: 19.1 and CMHT mean score: 11.2 t91= 5.53, P= <0.001, and HTRYP CGAS mean score: 51.0, CMHT mean score 58.9, t47= -2.0, P= 0.05). In terms of service input; the clinic time offered to HTRYP (1538 minutes) was significantly greater (t100= 3.79, P= <0.001) than the CMHT sample (518 minutes). Changes in outcome measures scores between TP1 and TP2 showed that the HTRYP made significantly greater improvement compared to CMHT YP; (HoNOSCA scores t54= 4.81, P= <0.001 and the CGAS scores t20= -3.61, P= <0.002). In Phase 3, only 16 (57%) of 28 HTRYP and 23 (43%) of 54 CMHT were successfully contacted. 13 HTRYP (46%) of 28 attended the follow up review compared with 9 (17%) of 54 CMHT. These YP were shown to be representative of the target populations from which they were selected. At follow up review the HTRYP, (HoNOSCA, Wx=13, p=0.031 and CGAS Wx=13, p=0.013) showed a greater clinical improvement in mental state from TP1 to TP3 compared to YP from CMHT (HoNOSCA, Wx=9, p=0.674 and CGAS, Wx=2, p=0.655). At TP3 the CMHT YP had maintained a higher overall level of social function and had lower level of deprivation than the HTRYP. However there was great variability in terms of social function between the YP within each sample (HTRYP and CMHT). Conclusion: The IP identified a high risk group of YP. They came from more deprived backgrounds and carried more burden of mental illness compared to YP attending the CMHT. Engaging the HTRYP required more clinical hours and they received a different care package to YP who attended the CMHT. The sub-set of HTRYP who received the IP therapeutic intervention, made a significant clinical improvement when compared to the YP attending the CMHT. The findings of this study suggest that HTRYP may benefit from a flexible, individualised resource intense service that includes an outreach capability to maximise engagement, assessment and intervention planning. However the sample size was small and the resource implications for this type of clinical provision are considerable. Further clinical research is needed to investigate what might be the most resource efficient and effective in terms of ways of working with this high risk group of YP to help reduce the immediate and long term burden of mental disorders.

AB  - Background: Mental health problems are disproportionately higher amongst homeless people. Many barriers exist for homeless people with mental health problems in accessing treatment yet little research has been done on service provision and quality of care for this group. The aim of this paper is to assess current service provision and identify barriers to care for homeless people with mental health problems in 14 European capital cities. Method: Two methods of data collection were employed; (i) In two highly deprived areas in each of the 14 European capital cities, homeless-specific services providing mental health, social care or general health services were assessed. Data were obtained on service characteristics, staff and programmes provided. (ii) Semi-structured interviews were conducted in each area with experts in mental health care provision for homeless people in order to determine the barriers to care and ways to overcome them. Results: Across the 14 capital cities, 111 homeless-specific services were assessed. Input from professionally qualified mental health staff was reported as low, as were levels of active outreach and case finding. Out-of-hours service provision appears inadequate and high levels of service exclusion criteria were evident. Prejudice in the services towards homeless people, a lack of co-ordination amongst services, and the difficulties homeless people face in obtaining health insurance were identified as major barriers to service provision. Conclusions: While there is variability in service provision across European capital cities, the reported barriers to service accessibility are common. Homeless-specific services are more responsive to the initial needs of homeless people with mental health problems, while generic services tend to be more conducive to long term care. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different service delivery models, including the most effective coordination of homeless specific and generic services.

Outreach is critical for connecting youth to services, but factors influencing their outreach engagement are unknown. This study examined predictors of meetings with outreach workers among 79 non-service connected, substance using homeless youth between 14 and 24 years of age. Results provide direction to service providers in that older age, higher levels of depressive symptoms, fewer drug-related problems, and no use of hard drugs within the prior 30 days predicted higher meeting attendance. Future research is needed testing strategies that overcome barriers to outreach engagement.

AB  - Professional literature in the past five years regarding the care and treatment of deinstitutionalized chronic mentally ill (CMI) persons has presented growing concerns that services for some CMI persons are inadequate or nonexistent. A number of previous authors have suggested that there may be a consistent, as opposed to a random, bias in the traditional mental health service delivery system whose services are contingent upon client characteristics that, in the very least, assume foresight, independence, initiative, and consistency. Lacking these qualities, clients may not seek services to which they are entitled or they may be frustrated in maintaining those services. This study provides a description of a CMI population (n = 142) that received outreach services from a small county psychiatric hospital. These clients were selected because they were evaluated as severely disturbed, potentially impulsive, and had a history of not following through with traditional mental health services, i.e., they did not make or keep prescribed appointments for therapy or education. This group served as a model against which to compare characteristics of the traditionally engaged clients. Previous authors as well as this study found that the dropout populations were younger, less compliant with prescribed anti-psychotic medication, engaged in more alcohol and drug use, were more likely to live independently and to be rehospitalized with greater frequency. Increased hospitalization also correlated with less functional independent living skills. In other reported research several variables were found to discriminate the younger CMI. This study could only confirm an increase in substance abuse although several confounding factors are discussed. Finally, the outreach program itself was examined, some services were quantified, and some were related to specific client characteristics. For instance, 40 percent of this CMI population was primarily reliant on their outreach worker for all transportation beyond walkable distances; and those clients receiving the most number of outpatient visits were those rated most rejecting of services and those with the poorest independent living skills. The treatment population was found to have reduced their total number of admissions and days hospitalized during the two-year period of investigation.

AB  - This paper presents background, implementation, and feasibility findings associated with planning and conducting an after-school intervention program in an alternative education setting designed to prevent the initiation and escalation of violence and substance abuse among urban African American youth at high risk for life-long problem behaviors. Evolving from earlier preventive interventions implemented in clinic and school settings, the program, entitled "The Village Model of Care", consisted of structured group mentoring, parental support, and community outreach services administered to alternative education students and their primary caregiver(s) during the school year. Over a two-year intake period, 109 youth participated in the present process evaluation study. Findings from the study not only provided relevant demographic information on the characteristics of youth likely to be included in such programs but also indicated the importance of including the family in the rehabilitation effort and the need for school administrative system support for the underlying alternative education approach. The information presented in this report has a direct bearing on the planning of future prevention efforts conducted in similar settings that are aimed at reducing problem behaviors and promoting positive lifestyles among high-risk youth.

AB  - Recent research indicates that children exposed to certain risk factors in their families, at school, among their peers, and in their communities are at greater risk of becoming serious violent juvenile (SVJ) offenders. The Study Group on Serious and Violent Juvenile Offenders, a group of 22 researchers convened by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to study the population of SVJ offenders, implementing family, school, and community interventions is the best way to prevent children from becoming SVJ offenders. Interventions include strategies that prevent problem behavior or that intervene to reduce future problem behavior. The Study Group also concluded that programs similar in philosophy to public health approaches (i.e., those that both address risk factors and introduce protective factors) are the most promising prevention and early intervention programs for SVJ offenders. The Study Group examined five types of school interventions: structured playground activities, behavioral consultation, behavioral monitoring and reinforcement, metal detectors, and schoolwide reorganization. Programs monitoring student behavior and reinforcing attendance and academic progress increased positive school behavior and academic achievement, and decreased delinquency. The Study Group also examined eight types of community interventions: citizen mobilization, situational prevention, comprehensive citizen intervention, mentoring, afterschool recreation programs, policing strategies, policy changes, and mass media interventions. Several of these interventions showed positive results in reducing risk and enhancing protective factors. In studies with long-term follow-up, certain programs were effective in reducing juvenile crime and substance abuse. (Contains 89 references.) (GCP)

AB  - This article describes a model designed to engage very high-risk pregnant and parenting young mothers who are not traditionally served by home visiting or other young parent programs. These disengaged young mothers do not live in stable environments: they are street or gang involved, in danger of dropping out of school or have already dropped out, court involved, struggling with substance abuse and mental health issues, involved in domestic violence situations, and/or are isolated immigrants and refugees. They are at very high risk for long-term negative adult outcomes, including unemployment, systems involvement, and long-term poverty, increasing the likelihood of negatively affecting their children. This model utilizes engagement strategies to intentionally find these young mothers and retain them in programming over long periods of time. These engagement strategies, developed based on Prochaska's stages of change model, include relentless outreach, transformational relationships, and stage-based programming. Through the implementation of these strategies, 81 very high-risk young mothers were identified and served in the Circle of Care Project. The participant retention rate was 90%. Implications suggest that very high-risk young parents can be good candidates for programming to improve their lives and the lives of their children, as long as that programming is developmentally appropriate and incorporates a strong relationship-building component.

AB  - Background: In a previous report, enhanced resource commitment at a Level I trauma center was associated with improved outcomes for most major categories of injured patients, except those with gunshot wounds, which disproportionately affected the young (ages 15 to 24 years). We hypothesized that a primary violence-prevention initiative geared toward changing attitudes about interpersonal conflict among at-risk youths can be effective. Study design: Between May 2002 and November 2003, 97 youths (mean age 12.6 years) were recruited from one of two Police Athletic League centers in the catchment area of our Level I trauma center. Participant attitudes about interpersonal conflicts were surveyed with six previously validated scales before and after a hospital tour with a video and slide presentation graphically depicting the results of gun violence. Mean differences in scores between pre- and postintervention surveys were assessed. Results: Of the 97 participants, 48 (49.4%) completed the intervention program with both the pre- and postintervention tests, with a mean of 25.8 days between tests. There was a statistically significant reduction in the Beliefs Supporting Aggression scale (mean −0.38 U; 95% CI, −0.23 to −0.54; p < 0.01), and a trend toward reduced Likelihood of Violence (mean −0.17 U; 95% CI, 0.01 to −0.34; p = 0.06). Conclusions: A multidisciplinary violence-prevention outreach program can produce short-term improvement in beliefs supporting aggression among at-risk youth. Longterm impact of this attitude change needs to be examined in future studies.

AB  - The Chicago Project for Violence Preventions (CPVP) main objective is to work with community and government partners to stop shootings in Chicago. In 2004 there were 448 homicides in Chicago. It is estimated that 75% of the victims and perpetrators were young Latino or African-American males. The average Chicago homicide perpetrator has eight prior felony convictions while victims have nine (Chicago Police Department). In an effort to reach those most likely to engage in violence, CPVP has created an outreach program in 8 Chicago neighborhoods and 3 other cities in Illinois. The outreach workers are charged with making contact with youth most at risk for committing violence to provide them with alternatives and mediate conflicts. During 2004, 90 outreach workers worked with over 1,300 clients, providing informal counseling 10,698 times, performing 7,467 home visits, appearing in court 173 times and appearing in school 681 times for their clients. The average age of these youth was 19.5 years old. Outreach staff made over 2,000 referrals for services. 200 clients gained employment and 115 were enrolled in school/GED programs. Outreach staff mediated 155 high-risk conflicts and implemented late night targeted outreach during peak day, time, and locations of shootings in 2004.

AB  - Public support payments may facilitate exit from homelessness for persons with mental illness. We examined data from 10,641 homeless veterans contacted from October 1, 1995 to September 30, 2002 in a collaborative outreach program designed to facilitate access to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits. Those who were awarded benefits (22% of contacted veterans) were more likely to report disability, poor to fair self-rated health, and were more likely to have used VA services in the past. Thus, this program achieved only modest success and was most successful with veterans who were already receiving VA services and who might have received benefits even without the outreach effort.

AB  - Statistics show that arrests of youth rose by nearly 79 percent in Hawaii during the past decade, in comparison with a 17 percent increase seen nationally during the same time period. While arrests of youths for serious violent crime rose 57 percent nationally, in Hawaii, juvenile arrests for violent crime remained virtually unchanged between 1983 and 1993; most of the increase in juvenile arrests was attributed to arrests for status offenses, including running away and violating curfews. This section of the evaluation describes some of the specific programs conducted by YGRS agencies to combat delinquency. These programs include Positive Alternative Gang Education (PAGE), which features a joint school-police effort to prevent children from youth gang involvement; the School Attendance Program (SAP), based on the premise that truancy can lead to other delinquent behaviors and gang activity; Boys and Girls Club of Honolulu recreational programs; an after-school tutoring program; and YMCA outreach services. 8 references and 1 appendix

AB  - Abstract: Cognitive–behavioral integrated treatment (CBIT) is an intervention that social workers can learn to treat youth''s drug abuse by cognitive restructuring, behavioral modification, and goal setting. A way to enhance the learning is training specifically for CBIT. Evaluation of the effectiveness of such training in raising social workers'' CBIT practice and their young service users'' illicit-drug-free days is the aim of this experimental study. This study first randomly assigned 14 outreach social workers to receive training for CBIT and 14 outreach social workers not to receive the training. The study also assessed 222 young service users (aged 11–22years) engaged by 28 outreach social workers before the training and 169 of them after the training in a six-month follow-up. Furthermore, the study identified the reduction in the youth''s dysfunctional cognition of playfulness as a means to deter the youth''s drug abuse, based on personal interviews with outreach social workers and their young service users before the training. Derived from the statistical analysis of assessment data, results principally showed cascading effects from the social worker''s reception of the CBIT training to the young service user''s reception of CBIT, reduced playfulness, and lengthened drug-free days. A supplementary finding was that the young service user''s time in the outreach social work service prolonged drug-free days and reduced playfulness. These results imply that the outreach social work service, CBIT training, and CBIT are useful for treating youth''s illicit drug abuse.

AB  - Background Outcomes are reported for an assertive outreach team for adolescents that combines flexible service delivery (e.g. outreach) and broad-ranging interventions. Method A retrospective evaluation over a 2-year period from 30 June 2006 to 30 June 2008 examined rates of hospitalisation, engagement with education and scores on the Child Global Assessment Scale ( CGAS). Results The sample showed statistically significant decreases in hospitalisation rates (from 47% to 17%) and increases in engagement with education (full-time attendance from 23% to 56%). There was a mean increase of 7.4 points on the CGAS. Conclusion An intensive, flexible and broad-ranging approach can be applied to adolescents who display at-risk behaviours and/or have high risk factors for poor long-term outcome.

AB  - Background There has been a significant reduction in the number of people with severe mental illness who spend extended periods in long-stay hospitals. District health authorities, local authorities, housing associations and voluntary organisations are jointly expected to provide support for people with severe mental disorder/s. This `support' may well involve some kind of special housing. Objectives To determine the effects of supported housing schemes compared with outreach support schemes or `standard care' for people with severe mental disorder/s living in the community. Search strategy For the 2006 update we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register ( April 2006) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ( CENTRAL, 2006 Issue 2). Selection criteria We included all relevant randomised, or quasi-randomised, trials dealing with people with `severe mental disorder/s' allocated to supported housing, compared with outreach support schemes or standard care. We focused on outcomes of service utilisation, mental state, satisfaction with care, social functioning, quality of life and economic data. Data collection and analysis We reliably selected studies, quality rated them and undertook data extraction. For dichotomous data, we would have estimated relative risks (RR), with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we would have calculated the number needed to treat statistic (NNT). We would have carried out analysis by intention-to-treat and would have summated normal continuous data using the weighted mean difference (WMD). We would have presented scale data for only those tools that had attained pre-specified levels of quality and undertaken tests for heterogeneity and publication bias. Main results Although 139 citations were acquired from the searches, no study met the inclusion criteria. Authors' conclusions Dedicated schemes whereby people with severe mental illness are located within one site or building with assistance from professional workers have potential for great benefit as they provide a `safe haven' for people in need of stability and support. This, however, may be at the risk of increasing dependence on professionals and prolonging exclusion from the community. Whether or not the benefits outweigh the risks can only be a matter of opinion in the absence of reliable evidence. There is an urgent need to investigate the effects of supported housing on people with severe mental illness within a randomised trial.

AB  - Investigated the secondary prevention effects of a substance abuse primary prevention program. Logistic regression analyses were conducted on 4 waves of follow-up data from 3,412 6th and 7th grade baseline users of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana taking part in a school-based program in Indianapolis. There were 1,508 Ss in the control group, and 1,904 Ss in the program group. The program demonstrated significant reductions in cigarette use at the initial follow-up (6 mo) and alcohol use at the 1st 2 follow-ups (up to 1.5 yrs). Models considering repeated measures also showed effects on all 3 substances. Primary prevention programs are able to reach and influence high-risk adolescents in a nonstigmatizing manner.

AB  - Concern over youth disengagement from schooling, particularly disengagement by youth facing dual challenges of English Language learning and socio-economic hardship, has led to support from national, state, and local entities for after-school programs. UC Links was created in 1996 by the University of California Office of the President to foster learning and school success among at-risk children. UC Links places university undergraduates in contact with elementary school students in the environment of an after-school computer club and embeds academic and social support within the playing of computer and board games and related literacy activities. Undergraduate-club member interactions are intended to improve club members' academic and social skills while raising their educational aspirations so they will think of themselves as future university students. This study examined the impact of university undergraduates on the club members' perception of a student at a university. The treatment group studied were 4th and 5th grade students who attended Hoover Elementary in Santa Ana during the school day and participated after-school in the UC Links Cosmic Dimension Computer Club during a nine month period from September 1999 to June 2000. All students in grades 4 and 5 at Hoover Elementary were invited to draw a picture of a student at a university and write a description of their drawing. From a population of 206, 77 drawings and descriptions by club members were compared with 129 drawings and descriptions from non-club participants. Analysis of the drawings revealed that Hoover children have considerable variation in their representations of a university student and that information about post-secondary education is coming from teachers, undergraduates, and relatives. The children's written descriptions proved to be a window into their thinking about post-secondary education. Major thematic messages were positive and represented the university as a place where students learn, study, graduate, pursue careers, and receive support from others. The university is described as a pleasant place where the children envision themselves, their friends, and their family. Results from this study suggest that 4th and 5th grades would be fertile targets for university outreach efforts to begin building the pipeline to post-secondary education.

AB  - The theory of planned behaviour, social identity theory and attitudes toward institutional authority were used to predict the uptake of outreach services over a 3-week period in a prospective study of 126 homeless people in a major UK city. Consistent with previous research, subjective norm was an important predictor, but so were identification with support services and attitudes to authority. The effect of intention on behaviour was moderated by subjective norm, such that intention affected behaviour more when subjective norm was weak. Subjective norm was affected by identification with support services, which in turn, was predicted by identification with homeless people and attitude to authority. It is concluded that the role of social identity and social norms is of central importance in understanding uptake of outreach services among homeless people. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Two studies involved structured interviews with 203 homeless people to examine the impact of sociodemographic variables, prior behavior, and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) variables, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention, on uptake of outreach services. Study 1 was conducted in London, and Study 2 involved a comparable sample in New York. In line with previous research, the psychological variables accounted for more variance than the sociodemographic variables, and there was no evidence that the effects of TPB variables were moderated by sociodemographics. In London intentions and behavior were most affected by perceived control and subjective norms. In New York they were most affected by perceived control and attitude. These differences may be attributable to different institutional structures and opportunities for service uptake in the two cities. Sensitivity of the TPB to social context and implications for intervention strategies are discussed in light of these differences.

AB  - Essential elements of a housing intervention designed to serve people who are homeless or risk becoming homeless, have severe mental illness, and may have a substance use disorder are described and summarized in a logic model. Characteristics of the target population (aged 19–63 yrs), the community and the service system are examined, and how this program serves to address the issues. The effectiveness of this intervention appears to be the result of the organizational characteristics. The organizational structure and climate provide: (a) integrated services under one 'umbrella'; (b) flexible, responsive service delivery; and (c) a treatment philosophy which builds on the strengths of residents through effective staff–resident relationships.

AB  - This report describes the Maternal Infant Health Outreach Worker (MIHOW) program which operates in Appalachia and rural Western Tennessee. The program, which constitutes a partnership between community organizations and the Vanderbilt University Center for Health Services, trains local women to use home visitations to educate and support other women in matters related to prenatal care and infant development. An evaluation of the impact of the MIHOW project on prenatal health behavior, infant feeding, and quality of home environment compared client information to information on a comparison group and made use of interviews with clients in their homes. The evaluation showed mixed results concerning prenatal care and pregnancy outcomes, but unequivocal success in the postnatal phase. Monthly home visits made a difference in prenatal self-care and may have had an impact on prenatal care use, but had no apparent effect on the birthweights of infants. The results showed that a family support intervention using paraprofessional home visitors can improve the quality of the home environment of rural low-income children. (RJC)

This article discusses findings from a research evaluation that examined the advantages of participating in this service. The experiences of young people and youth workers involved showed a commitment to youth work values and methods that contributed to support and helped reduce feelings of isolation. The findings suggested that one-to-one support and group work sessions brought benefits in establishing empathy and generating positive experiences. This helped the young people to better understand domestic abuse and to feel safe and confident about working through their feelings and making new friends. Analysis also suggested that young people valued the services provided by qualified and experienced Women's Aid youth workers, which they perceived as different from other youth work services. The arguments for this kind of specialist service were compelling, yet analysis highlighted a need for caution in order to avoid creating dependency. There were also calls for improved communication and understanding among partner agencies involved in work with young people.

AB  - This report contains a summary of a survey of violence prevention programs and a conference on the state of the art in evaluating such programs, as well as conclusions and recommendations. The survey of 51 violence prevention programs focused on evaluation activities. Analysis of the data indicated: frequently the goals have not been used to refine objectives that can be used in evaluation design; there have been few attempts to employ multiple measures of impact; and there has been little attempt to examine the differential effects of interventions on subgroups of youth at risk. The conference summary includes texts of presentations by four individuals and findings from the discussion. These conclusions and recommendations are presented: (1) funding and technical assistance should be made available to review identified promising programs; (2) the provision of resources for the expanded evaluation of promising programs is a task beyond the capacity of any single funding source; and (3) the identified promising projects should be used as laboratories for the development of intermediate outcome measures, for the validation of existing measures, and for the development of new evaluation methods. Specific product recommendations made include a handbook on violence prevention and a catalog on culturally sensitive measures in evaluation. Recommended activities include convening an annual meeting; conducting a summer institute; developing interdisciplinary research centers; increasing outreach to and recruitment of minority students and faculty; and conducting rigorous evaluations of model programs.

AB  - Investigated differences between substance abusers (alcohol, drugs, or both) and nonabusers in 1,166 persons (mean age 27.8 yrs) identified as homeless or at risk of homelessness by an assertive outreach program in a moderate size city. The 603 self-reported substance abusers included disproportionate numbers of male, Black, unmarried, and currently homeless persons with a history or symptoms of mental illness, who expressed a primary need for assistance dealing with the social service system. Type of abuse was associated with demographic characteristics, length of homelessness, mental illness status, and primary expressed needs. An accurate picture of subgroup differences can aid design and delivery of services for the homeless. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The process evaluation gathered information by means of interviews of project staff at 37 projects, as well as government and school officials and criminal justice personnel. A quasi-experimental, retrospective pre-post design was also used to compare outcomes for participants and nonparticipants in the 13 consortium projects that provided direct services. The programs served youth at risk of gang and drug involvement due to school problems, families with low income or headed by a single parent, the lack of a support system, and a propensity for delinquency. Staff reported that youth took part because they needed something to do, sought physical activities, or had been urged to participate by others. They dropped out due to moves, boredom, age, or conflicting obligations. The 52 projects implemented more than 30 recreation, education, tutoring, outreach, cultural, and counseling services for youth, families, and the community. After participating in the program, participants were less likely than nonparticipants to have reported engaging in delinquent behavior overall and in specific delinquent behaviors. Participants were also less likely than nonparticipants to report using alcohol or other drugs after participating in the program. Both participants and nonparticipants had small decreases in their gang involvement. Additional findings, process and outcome recommendations, and 125 references

AB  - The secondary effect of a national, targeted, outreach initiative in reducing sexual risk behavior among newly diagnosed persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) was examined in the present study. The findings propose an optimal number of outreach program contacts associated with a change in sexual risk behavior. The primary goal of the initiative was to implement and evaluate strategies to engage and retain underserved populations (PLWHA) in HIV primary medical care. Participants from 10 sites nationwide were enrolled in outreach interventions from 2004 to 2005 that were designed to engage and retain hard-to-reach PLWH in care. The study population in the subanalysis performed was predominantly male, people of color, sexual minorities; mean age of 32, and 31% reported no visits to an HIV health provider since testing positive. The study design was prospective and nonrandomized; 116 newly diagnosed individuals reported on unprotected sex at baseline, 6-, and 12-month interviews. The proportion of individuals reporting unprotected sex postintervention was reduced significantly compared to baseline. Postbaseline, individuals were 80% less likely to report unprotected sex. Additionally, individuals with 1–3 program contacts per month were 80 times less likely to report risky sexual behavior compared to those with 2 or less contacts (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.20). Substantial risk exists for secondary HIV transmission; this study shows the promise of a supplemental intervention to ensure access to HIV care, retention in care, and risk reduction for positives.

AB  - Persons who inject drugs (PWID) are at risk for adverse health outcomes as a result of their drug use, and the resulting social stigma makes this a difficult population to reach for interventions aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality. During our study of adult PWID aged < 40 years living in San Diego during 2009 and 2010, we compared three different sampling methods: respondent-driven sampling (RDS), venue-based sampling at one syringe exchange program (SEP), and street-based outreach. We compared demographic, socioeconomic, health, and behavioral factors and tested participants for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and compared across the three methods. Overall, 561 (74.8%) of the targeted 750 PWID were enrolled. Venue-based convenience sampling enrolled 96% (242/250) of the targeted participants, followed closely by street-based outreach with 92% (232/250) recruited. While RDS yielded the fewest recruits, producing only 35% (87/250) of the expected participants, those recruited through RDS were more likely to be female, more racially diverse, and younger.

AB  - Implemented and evaluated the Street Outreach to Drug Abusers-Community AIDS Prevention Project, an HIV-prevention intervention aimed at current drug users. The intervention was developed using social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model of change. The outreach team assessed individuals' stages of change for the target behaviors and they were given stage-appropriate role-model stories. The program effects were evaluated using a quasi-experimental design with a repeated, cross-sectional sampling method in which community surveys were completed in 1996 (baseline), 1997, and 1998 to a total of 2,059 African Americans (mean age 34.18 yrs). Multivariate statistical models were developed for 4 outcomes (condom use with main and other partners, treatment entry, and stopping all drug and alcohol use). Exposure to intervention was a significant predictor for condom use with other partners and for stopping drug and alcohol use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study evaluated an HIV-prevention program to determine whether a street outreach intervention could increase condom use with main sex partner and with nonmain sex partners. In addition, the study attempted to determine whether the intervention could assist current drug users to either enter substance abuse treatment or to stop using all drugs and alcohol. The intervention used street outreach workers to distribute prevention messages in the form of role-model stories and personal persuasion from the workers. Safer-sex materials, including male condoms, were also distributed. The program was evaluated via a quasi-experimental design with four communities randomly assigned to either the intervention or the comparison condition. These four communities had been identified as having high incidence of sexually transmitted diseases and drug-related arrests. A time-place sampling frame was developed by using ethnographic methods. A total of 2059 subjects were intercepted going into or out of drug procurement zones. Surveys were conducted in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Analyses failed to show an HIV-prevention effect on the intervention communities as compared with comparison communities. However, some impact of the intervention was seen among residents exposed to the intervention compared with those not exposed. Specifically, the Street Outreach to Drug Abusers-Community AIDS Prevention (SODA-CAP) intervention reached substantial numbers of the target population and facilitated movement toward adopting consistent condom-use practices with sex partners other than the individual's primary sex partner. Exposure to the intervention also had an influence on readiness to stop using all drugs and alcohol. The ability of the SODA-CAP intervention to facilitate behavior change among a population of drug and alcohol users suggests the potential usefulness of this intervention approach to HIV prevention.

AB  - Abstract: A special program of outreach services was implemented to assist a poverty population to appropriately use health services in the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program. A study was conducted to determine the effect of outreach workers' intervention on the use of preventive services by this population. Initially, families were divided into two groups, one with and one without outreach workers. Outreach workers (neighborhood health coordinators) were trained in prevention and health education. They were then assigned to specific subgroups of the poverty population to teach the importance of preventive services and to motivate persons to use these services. This paper focuses on the effect of outreach workers' services on the use of selected preventive care services (immunizations and tine test) by preschool children from poverty families. Preschool children in families with coordinator services had higher use rates for preventive care. The sub-group for which outreach workers were specially trained to focus on preventive procedures for the pre-school group had markedly higher use rates for preventive care. The findings suggest that special intervention programs, using indigenous and nonprofessional outreach workers, can increase preventive service utilization by poverty groups.

AB  - This paper provides the results from an evaluation of the implementation and impact of the One Vision One Life (OVOL) program in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. OVOL, modeled after Chicago's version of Operation Ceasefire, is a community-driven violence prevention initiative that includes problem-solving, homicide incident reviews, public and "behind the scenes" responses to all homicides, collaborative partnerships, programs for at-risk youth, conflict intervention and mediation through the use of streetworkers and street intelligence, public education, community mobilization, and outreach. OVOL was first implemented in three Pittsburgh neighborhoods beginning in May 2004. As background information, we will present qualitative data to discuss the form, substance, and dosage of the program's implementation. Outcome data will include homicide, aggravated assault, and aggravated assault with a gun. Through a quasi-experimental design, we ascertain if these offenses were reduced after the program was implemented in the target neighborhoods relative to matched non-intervention control neighborhoods. The analysis will also determine if OVOL displaced crime into or extended violence suppression effects to surrounding neighborhoods. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess behavior change in the areas of drug use, productivity, criminal activity, and HIV risk among street-recruited injection drug users who entered methadone maintenance treatment. In addition, the study examined a number of variables that could account for these changes, including demographics, intervention effects, and treatment-related measures. A total of 168 participants were interviewed at baseline, received outreach interventions, entered methadone maintenance treatment, and were reinterviewed 5-9 months later. Significant (p<.001) improvements were seen in the areas of drug use, productivity, criminality, and HIV risk behaviors. The only variables significantly associated with behavior change were related to drug treatment. In particular, being in treatment at the time of the follow-up assessment had the strongest relationship to positive outcomes, including length of treatment. Having no prior treatment experience was associated with fewer injections at follow-up. These findings emphasize the importance of retaining clients, given the likelihood that positive change is likely to be evidenced while they remain in treatment.

AB  - Responding to the need for a universal and comprehensive approach for supporting all families with children from birth through age 5, the Early Childhood Initiative (ECI) was launched by a broad-based coalition of public and private partners brought together by the Cuyahoga County government in Ohio. This report describes the history of ECI, provides a statistical portrait of the early childhood population in Cuyahoga County, and examines ECI's scope and reach of in terms of the early childhood population in Cuyahoga County. In addition, the report details the evaluation findings of sub-studies examining the components of the program: (1) a one-time home visit by a nurse with first-time or teen mothers; (2) intensive home visits for at-risk children up to 3 years of age; (3) expansion and quality improvement of certified home-based child care; (4) child caregiver training, including training related to special needs child care; and (5) outreach and expansion of government-subsidized health insurance coverage for children of low-income families. Findings relate to capacity and systems, service provision and quality, and outcomes. Emerging through the ECI studies were five themes: taking the initiative to scale and expanding capacity; implementing leadership and collaboration; targeting and outreach; attaining and maintaining quality; and policy context and external factors. Both positive aspects and barriers and challenges are discussed for each theme. Recommendations are offered for the program's next 2-year phase. The report concludes by asserting that ECI has greatly enhanced the system of caring for children in Cuyahoga County, has been successful in meeting many of the objectives of the comprehensive package of programs and activities, and continues to pursue the goals of healthy children, effective parenting, and quality child care in Cuyahoga County.

AB  - The Maternal and Infant Health Outreach Worker Program (MIHOW) of Vanderbilt University's Center for Health Services gathered data on family planning, prenatal care, pregnancy outcomes, breastfeeding, and preventive child health care from 60 women in 6 rural, low income communities in Tennessee, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The resulting baseline was used to compare MIHOW program effectiveness, and to examine characteristics of women in poverty and how their poverty impacts maternal and infant health and health practices. The survey related measures of health care, status, and practices to resources, information, and access to care. Intermediate measures included adequacy of income to provide food at all times, type of support, sources of knowledge, and availability of transportation. Findings suggested resources for low income women and children were too low and that community-based home visitor programs were appropriate to provide additional resources. The survey found birth weights, contraceptive use, prenatal care, and breastfeeding all below national averages. Female-headed households, nonemployment income sources, age, and race were significant determining factors. Discussion of survey results contains 29 tables; survey data keyed to each table form the appendix. A map locates MIHOW survey communities. (LFL)

AB  - The special problems of the homeless psychiatrically ill are described and how services have developed to meet their needs. For reasons that are far from clear these problems are increasing and, despite the development of specific teams focused on the care of the homeless with mental illness, a great deal more needs to be done.Although the formation of outreach teams and related services have succeeded in improving care for this group their long-term outcome is uncertain and much more needs to be known.

AB  - Describes the development and outcomes of a 'low demand respite' residence in Philadelphia that was initiated to serve 'noncompliant,' treatment-resistant homeless women with mental illness. Through aggressive outreach and a low-demand congregate housing program, the program has been successful in bringing 120 women off the streets. Residents are required neither to undergo treatment nor to stay in the program, but are encouraged to seek mental health services and medical treatment. Former residents can be found primarily in independent housing (42.2%) and secondarily in highly and moderately structured housing. 14.1% of the former residents have returned to street life, but continue to receive outreach services.

AB  - This article presents the main findings of the second phase of a 'modest Inquiry' into the state of youth work within the still evolving integrated youth support services of eight local authorities. The Inquiry, carried out in the summer of 2010 by staff of Leicester De Montfort University, explored how youth work's defining features were responding to the continuing influence of New Labour requirements to meet statistical targets, to target 'at risk' and 'risky' young people, to 'integrate' youth work with other services; and to the early stages of the Coalition's public service cuts. Though the evidence was limited, it suggested significant gaps of perspective and experience between managers and workers on some of these issues. Concerns also emerged within the voluntary sector about the implications for them of these developments and also about the commissioning regimes increasingly being implemented by local authorities. Young people's views on some of these issues were also recorded. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The transfer to a new school or grade has been identified as a typical transition period for students that is usually characterized by declining academic performance and increased absences. At the close of the 1991-92 academic year 26% of 9th-grade students in a large urban high school were failing 50% or more of their courses. A preventive network of student assistance programs was designed to increase the level of available student supports within the social environment of the school and thereby reduce the number of students experiencing failure. The preventive approach attempted to reach out to a cohort of transitioning 9th-grade students (N=67) considered to be at-risk for continued school failure and dropout. Intervention components included: technological support; student-centered support; instructional support; community-focused outreach; school governance; and teachers' professional staff development. During the course of the year 39% of the 67 students targeted for study withdrew from the high school to re-enroll elsewhere. Records show that as expected with the transition from middle school to high school attendance figures dropped for this group, resulting in an increase in absences from an 8th-grade average of 19.1 to a 9th-grade average of 22.26. Overall, an analysis of grades for all freshmen showed that the programmatic efforts resulted in a reduction in the incidence of freshmen failure from 26% to 14%.

AB  - This document presents a review of the literature on the nature of alcohol and other drug problems among Hispanic American youth, analyzes a series of programs funded by the Office for Substance Abuse Prevention (OSAP) for Hispanic Americans, and presents the results of an evaluation of those programs. The section reviewing literature on drug abuse among Hispanic American youth notes the lack of reliable information on this population and the shortcomings of the available studies. However, the report does note the following: (1) adolescent Spanish Americans represent the third largest group of drinkers; (2) Hispanic American female adolescents have low rates of drug use; (3) there are important gender differences in drug use; (4) drug use increases with age; and (5) recent data show lower rates of use among Hispanic Americans as compared to Anglo Americans. The report emphasizes the importance of Hispanic culture in any analysis of services for Hispanic Americans. The study of OSAP demonstration projects resulted in the following findings: (1) most projects identified at-risk youth from diverse sources; (2) most focused on the economically disadvantaged; (3) the projects used a variety of approaches; (4) nearly half are developing specialized curriculum; (5) many positive outcomes were anticipated; (6) outreach to the community was a prominent part of most programming; and (7) similar implementation problems arose across programs. Included are four tables, two graphs, recommendations, a copy of the site visit evaluation questionnaire, and 78 references. (JB)

AB  - Purpose: Current government policy aims to tackle youth anti-social behaviour and its psychological and social impacts. Given an increased likelihood that young victims of crime are also likely to engage in aggressive or deviant behaviour and to have psychological and social difficulties, interventions are needed which access vulnerable youth with adverse lifestyles to increase well-being and reduce offending. The current project utilised a hospital emergency department (ED) as an appropriate location to identify and interact with youth victims of violent crime; to support key lifestyle risk and mental health difficulties; and build resilience. The purpose of this paper is to use a youth work paradigm, to target vulnerable youth in a health setting at a crisis point where intervention may have a higher chance of uptake. Design/methodology/approach: The study applied a quasi-experimental, longitudinal design. Using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire and the 'What Do You Think' component of the ASSET risk assessment, data were collected from 120 youth aged 12-20, at baseline with 66 youth who successfully completed the programme with assessments at baseline and follow-up, at an average of 14 weeks. Findings: There was significant reduction in both psychological problems and lifestyle risk at follow-up. Research limitations/implications: These findings support the government initiative to intervene in youth violence in healthcare settings. Challenges revolve around increasing participation and greater formalisation of the intervention. Originality/value: The youth work led violence intervention in the ED is successfully tackling psychological problems and lifestyle risk following injury.

AB  - Objective: The at-risk mental state (ARMS) is associated with a very high risk of psychosis, but it is difficult to predict which individuals will later develop psychosis on the basis of their presenting symptoms. We investigated psychopathological dimensions in subjects with an ARMS and examined whether particular symptom dimensions predicted subsequent transition to psychosis. Method: The sample comprised 122 subjects (aged 16–35 years) meeting Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation clinic criteria for the ARMS recruited through Outreach and Support in South London, a clinical service for people with an ARMS. A principal axis factor analysis was performed on symptom scores, obtained at presentation from the Comprehensive Assessment of the At-Risk Mental State, using Varimax rotation. The relationship between dimension scores and transition to psychosis during the following 24 months was then examined employing Cox regression analysis. Results: Factor analysis gave rise to a 5-factor solution of negative, anxiety, disorganization/cognitive, self-harm, and manic symptom dimensions, accounting for 37% of the total variance. Scores on the negative and on the disorganization/cognitive dimensions were associated with transition to psychosis during the follow-up period (P = 0.044 and P = 0.005, respectively). Conclusion: The symptoms of the ARMS have a dimensional structure similar to that evident in patients with schizophrenia except for the positive symptom dimension. The association between scores on the disorganization/cognitive and negative dimensions and later transition is consistent with independent evidence that formal thought disorder, subjective cognitive impairments, and negative symptoms are linked to the subsequent onset of psychosis.

AB  - Objective: Pregnancy in youth is considered high risk from a number of different standpoints. At present, limited data has explored demographic factors associated with Canadian cohorts of pregnant and postpartum youth seeking mental health services. We aimed to describe demographic characteristics associated with pregnant and postpartum youth and young adults referred for mental health services in the community and to compare this with data drawn from a hospital-based perinatal mental health clinic. Method: Patients were recruited at a young parents' outreach center (YPOC) in a large urban Canadian city. The patients completed questionnaires at the time of initial assessment. The number of attended and missed appointments was tracked and compared to a hospital-based control group in an effort to determine whether the community-based clinic would result in fewer missed appointments. Results: A total of 28 patients were assessed at the YPOC. The mean age of all participants was 19.4 years (+/-2.3years) as compared to 18.57 years (± 1.81 years) for the hospital-based group. Rates of poverty were high, and high school completion and level of social support low for many patients. Patients attending the YPOC clinic missed fewer appointments overall. Conclusions: Pregnant and postpartum adolescents and young adults possess multiple risk factors across various domains that threaten short and long term health outcomes. Establishment of outreach mental health clinics may help minimize barriers to care as demonstrated in the present study by fewer missed appointments and should be investigated further as a means of improving mental health access and outcomes. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objectif: La grossesse chez les adolescentes est considérée à risque élevé d'un certain nombre de points de vue différents. À l'heure actuelle, des données limitées ont exploré les facteurs démographiques associés aux cohortes canadiennes d'adolescentes enceintes et en postpartum qui cherchent à obtenir des services de santé mentale. Nous visions à décrire les caractéristiques démographiques associées aux adolescentes et aux jeunes femmes enceintes et en postpartum adressées à des services de santé mentale dans la communauté, et à les comparer avec des données tirées d'une clinique de santé mentale périnatale en milieu hospitalier. Méthode: Les patientes ont été recrutées dans un centre d'approche pour jeunes parents (CAJP) d'un grand centre urbain canadien. Les patientes ont répondu à un questionnaire au moment de leur évaluation initiale. Le nombre de rendez-vous respectés et manqués a été suivi et comparé avec celui d'un groupe témoin en milieu hospitalier en vue de déterminer si la clinique communautaire aurait moins de rendez-vous manqués. Résultat: Au total, 28 patientes ont été évaluées au CAJP. L'âge moyen de toutes les participantes était de 19,4 ans (+/-2,3 ans) comparativement à 18,57 ans (± 1.81 an) pour le groupe en milieu hospitalier. Les taux de pauvreté étaient élevés, et ceux d'études secondaires terminées et de soutien social étaient faibles pour beaucoup de patientes. Les patientes de la clinique du CAJP ont manqué moins de rendez-vous globalement. Conclusions: Les adolescentes et les jeunes femmes enceintes et en postpartum présentent de multiples facteurs de risque dans divers domaines qui menacent les résultats de santé à court et à long terme. La création de cliniques de santé mentale d'approche peut contribuer à minimiser les obstacles aux soins comme le démontre la présente étude par le nombre réduit de rendez-vous manqués, et devrait faire l'objet de plus de recherche comme moyen d'améliorer l'accès à la santé mentale et les résultats.

AB  - Objective: Approval rates for first-time applications for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) among adults who are homeless can be as low as 10%. This study examined approval rates among applicants who were assisted by SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery (SOAR), a federal initiative to increase access to disability benefits among people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and who have mental illness or other co-occurring disorders. Methods: Data were collected in 37 states that had participated in SOAR for at least one year. Results: Of 8,978 applications assisted by SOAR, 6,558 (73%) were approved. The average number of days between application and decision was 91. SOAR was associated with increased access to housing and cost savings through increased Medicaid reimbursement. Conclusions: SOAR substantially increased access to SSI and SSDI entitlements for people with disabilities who experience or are at risk for homelessness.

AB  - Objective: Using a longitudinal, randomized controlled trial, this study assessed the impact of a community-based outreach versus a more traditional criminal justice system-based referral program on women's distress and safety following police-reported intimate partner abuse (IPA). Method: Wom (N = 236 women) with police-reported IPA were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 interdisciplinary community-coordinated response program conditions: Outreach (community-based victim advocate outreach) or Referral (criminal justice system-based victim advocate referrals to community-ba agencies). Participants were interviewed 3 times over a 1-year period: within 26 (median) days of police-reported 1PA, 6 months later, and 12 months later. Primary outcome measures included posttraumatic stress disorder and depression symptom severity (Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale; Beck Depression Inventory-ll), fear appraisals (Trauma Appraisal Questionnaire), IPA revictimization (Revised Conflict Tactics Scale), and readiness to leave the relationship with the abuser. Results: One ye after the initial interview, women in the Outreach condition reported decreased PTSD and depression symptom severity and fear compared with women in the Referral condition. Although both conditions were unrelated to revictimization in the follow-up year, women in the Outreach condition reported greater readiness to leave the abuser and rated services as more helpful than women in the Referral condition Conclusions: This is one of the first studies to examine community-based outreach in the context of an interdisciplinary community coordinated response to police-reported IPA. The findings suggest that community-based outreach by victim advocates results in decreased distress levels, greater readiness to leave abusive relationships, and greater perceived helpfulness of services relative to system-based referrals.

AB  - Randomized control designs have been used in the public health and psychological literatures to examine the relationship between victim outreach following intimate partner abuse (IPA) and various outcomes. These studies have largely relied on samples drawn from health providers and shelters to examine outcomes outside the criminal legal system. Based on the positive findings from this body of research, we expected that a victim-focused, community-coordinated outreach intervention would improve criminal legal system outcomes. The current study used a randomized, longitudinal design to recruit 236 ethnically diverse women with police-reported IPA to compare treatment-as-usual with an innovative community-coordinated, victim-focused outreach program. Findings indicated that the outreach program was effective in increasing women’s engagement with prosecution tasks as well as likelihood of taking part in prosecution of their abusers. Results were particularly robust among women marginalized by ethnicity and class, and those still living with their abusers after the target incident.

AB  - Purpose: To develop and pilot a theory-based, mobile phone texting component attractive to minority youth as a supplement to the Teen Outreach Program®, a youth development program for reducing teen pregnancy and school dropout. Methods:We conducted iterative formative research with minority youth in multiple focus groups to explore interest in texting and reaction to text messages. We piloted a month-long version of TOP® Plus Text with 96 teens at four sites and conducted a computer-based survey immediately after enrollment and at the end of the pilot that collected information about teens’ values, social support, self-efficacy, and behaviors relating to school performance, trouble with the law, and sexual activity. After each of the first three weekly sessions we collected satisfaction measures. Upon completion of the pilot we conducted exit interviews with twelve purposively selected pilot participants. Results: We successfully recruited and enrolled minority youth into the pilot. Teens were enthusiastic about text messages complementing TOP®. Results also revealed barriers: access to text-capable mobile phones, retention as measured by completion of the post-pilot survey, and a need to be attentive to teen literacy. Conclusions: Piloting helped identify improvements for implementation including offering text messages through multiple platforms so youth without access to a mobile phone could receive messages; rewording texts to allow youth to express opinions without feeling judged; and collecting multiple types of contact information to improve follow-up. Thoughtful attention to social and behavioral theory and investment in iterative formative research with extensive consultation with teens can lead to an engaging texting curriculum that enhances and complements TOP®.

AB  - Children who manifest serious conduct problems in their early years are likely to experience increasing difficulties in adolescence and adulthood. Early intervention strategies, therefore, can play an important role in improving outcomes for these children and their families. One such intervention - the SNAP (Stop Now And Plan) Under 12 Outreach Project - uses a multifaceted approach to treating boys under 12 years of age in conflict with the law. This study uses the Early Assessment Risk List for Boys (EARL-20B), an assessment tool that specifically measures future antisocial potential in young boys, to examine the effectiveness of the SNAP ORP in a sample of 319 boys in relation to risk classification (i.e., problem severity) and treatment intensity. Mixed model and growth curve analyses were used to measure these relationships at admission, post and six months follow-up. Results showed a significant overall reduction in parent-reported delinquent behaviour, and a significant relationship between risk class, service intensity and outcome. Overall, the findings support the EARL-20B as a clinical risk management tool and suggest that better treatment outcomes can be achieved by taking into account assessed client risk and need. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of a California state mandated effort to reduce dropout rates. In particular, the analysis looks at which program components and strategies are successful in increasing school holding power and what organizational and administrative factors are linked to the decision to actually implement the program as designed. Section I of the analysis describes the legislated program and its outcomes, including assessment of the value of specific techniques (such as early identification of at-risk students, the value of parent involvement, and career training programs). After brief discussions of program components (an outreach consultant, student study teams as a dropout prevention methodology, school site councils in dropout prevention, and school-based coordination) in section I, section II explores the issues by examining linkages between specific program components or techniques and improvement in overall school holding power. Linkages are also examined for specific gender and ethnic target groups and the impact of the program on lower grades. Section III moves to mapping the program context, and examines the link between adoption or emphasis of the state program elements and roles played by three major institutional actors (the outreach consultant or program coordinator, the school principal, and the relevant oversight units of the California State Department of Education). Included are 15 tables and 4 figures. (JB)

AB  - Recent research has indicated that young people experiencing homelessness live with high rates of psychological distress and mental illness, yet often do not access mental health services due to a number of barriers. Access may be enhanced through greater interagency collaboration, adopting principles of early intervention, outreach and youth cultural competence. The St Vincent's Hospital Program for Early Intervention and Prevention of Disability (PEIPOD) has implemented these recommendations in an innovative outreach clinic being conducted at Oasis Youth Support Network in Sydney (Oasis). The purpose of this article is to describe the clinic and to present the perspectives of Oasis youth workers and the PEIPOD clinical team arising from focus groups regarding the extent to which the clinic has: (i) facilitated access to mental health services for young people; (ii) provided a positive experience of a mental health service for young people; and (iii) enhanced the capacity for Oasis staff to work with young people living with complex needs and mental illness. This article also reports the results of a file audit of all case notes and triage forms for the 29 clients who attended the clinic between January 2010 and January 2011. Findings suggest that the highly transient behaviour of the Oasis clients is a key challenge to linking young people to (mental health) services. This article describes several service strengths, including the close partnership between Oasis and PEIPOD staff and access to a mental health assessment for young people at a youth-friendly location. Recommendations arising from the staff interviews include expanding the outreach clinic model to other service sites, improving handover information from the Oasis youth support staff and involving medical staff in the clinic assessment.

AB  - By offering information, counseling, and tutoring, college outreach programs attempt to smooth the path between high school and higher education for at-risk students. But do these program work? This paper uses longitudinal data from the Education Longitudinal Study to construct two quasi-experiments to assess the effectiveness of college outreach. The first compares outreach program participants with a propensity score matched sample of program non-participants to measure the effects of targeted college outreach programs. The second assesses the effects of school-wide college outreach programs by comparing students in school-wide outreach high schools with students in a matched sample of high schools that offer no formal outreach. The results suggest that targeted outreach programs do little to change the educational experiences of participating students. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that school-wide outreach programs may have modest "spillover" effects, improving the educational outcomes of relatively unengaged students at participating schools.

AB  - Highlights • Integrated intensive outreach interventions for HYFEPA contribute to better outcomes. • 80% of HYFEPA achieve housing stability and remain engaged in services at 24 months. • There is a significant reduction over time of substance use disorders. Abstract In Canada, about 6,000 youth are homeless every night, many of whom suffer from addiction and psychotic disorders. To facilitate the exit out of homelessness, access to care and to improve psychosis and addiction outcomes, a new intensive outreach intervention team (EQIIP SOL) was created in Montreal (2012). It offers intensive outreach services dedicated to homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and addiction (HYFEPA) in addition to an early psychosis intervention service (EIS) in collaboration with the Addiction Psychiatry Unit. Our aim is to describe the characteristics, clinical, functional and housing outcomes of HYFEPA followed by EQIIP SOL. This two years long prospective longitudinal study with all HYFEPA (n = 42) admitted to EQIIP SOL between 2012–2015 reports at multiple time points, clinical (CGI, GAF), functional (SOFAS, work/study, housing autonomy) and substance use disorder (DUS, AUS) outcomes and acute services use (hospitalizations, emergency room visits). We observed that, at baseline, HYFEPA showed poor prognostic factors (eg. cluster B personality, substance use disorders, legal problems, childhood trauma and lower education level). The majority reached housing stability after 6 months and their functioning and illness severity improved with time. This suggests that HYFEPA improve with an intensive outreach intervention team integrated to an EIS.

AB  - Aim: No previous study has investigated interventions for homeless youth suffering from first episode psychosis and comorbid substance use disorder (HYPS). An intensive assertive community intervention team (IACIT) offering outreach interventions, housing support as well as integrated care for early psychosis and substance use disorder (SUD) was created in 2012 at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM). To explore the impact of the addition of an IACIT to an early intervention for psychosis service (EIS) on housing stability, functional and symptomatic outcomes and mental health service use. Methods: A two‐year longitudinal study comparing the outcome of HYPS receiving combined EIS and IACIT since 2012, to a historical cohort of HYPS receiving EIS only between 2005 and 2011. Socio‐demographic data, housing stability, functioning, illness severity, SUD severity, emergency room visits and hospitalizations were assessed at admission, at 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter. Results: HYPS receiving EIS + IACIT achieved housing stability more rapidly and spent less time hospitalized than HYPS getting EIS only (RR 2.38, P =.017). HYPS with cocaine misuse were less likely to attain housing stability (RR 0.25, P =.04). No between‐group differences were found for psychiatric symptoms, functioning and SUD outcomes. Conclusion: The addition of IACIT‐HYPS to EIS was associated with earlier housing stability and reduced total hospitalization days compared to EIS alone.

AB  - Initiated in 1994, Structured Learning Assistance (SLA) is a research project whose purpose is to determine if, for certain courses, grades can be improved by requiring students to attend weekly practice workshops. These SLA workshops assist students in developing the background needed to connect to the course content and to develop and apply the learning strategies most appropriate to the content area. This report details the 3-year findings of the SLA project, as well as findings for all students who participated in it during the 1996-1997 academic year, with a focus on minority students. Results indicated that SLA can significantly improve student pass rates, even for at-risk students. In nearly 85% of the 42 courses offered with SLA support, the SLA students had higher pass rates than those of all other university students taking the same courses. This improvement was especially marked in the mathematics courses, where the average pass rate increased anywhere from 24 to 45 percent. Student evaluations of the SLA project are included. Appended are minority and total student data for fall 1996 and winter 1997, statistics on the project's 3-year averages, and pass rate by subject area. (EMH)

AB  - A comprehensive study of the Adult Education for the Homeless Program (AEH) was conducted using data from the following sources: program files; focus groups conducted with state project administrators; site visits to 9 local programs in 3 states; surveys of 32 state projects, 230 local programs, 588 service delivery sites, and 2,943 program participants; and an assessment of the literacy skills of a representative sample of new enrollees at 30 local programs. The following were among the study's major findings: AEH clients are making progress but still function at a fairly low level; establishment of the AEH-created educational services where none were available previously; AEH services are offered in residential and nonresidential settings, and nearly all local programs have implemented aggressive outreach strategies to attract homeless participants; AEH clients differ from the homeless population at large; the AEH program's limited resources and the high rate of mobility among homeless individuals pose formidable challenges to the program's ability to meet its clients' educational needs. Appended are the following: state-by-state descriptive data, state/local surveys; a document literacy test; and statistical methods and detailed results of the analyses of client participation and academic improvement.

AB  - This conference paper discusses the results of a study that investigated the characteristics and needs of mothers participating in Hawaii's Healthy Start Program (HSP). The HSP is a screening and outreach program with two components: (1) the early identification component, which consists of community-based screening to identify newborns at environmental risk for child abuse and neglect and (2) the Home Visiting component, which consists of in-home counseling by trained paraprofessionals. The evaluation focused on six geographically defined communities on Oahu that are served by HSP program sites and included a sample of 664 participants. Results indicated: (1) most mothers qualify for the state's health coverage program, which is targeted to low-income families; (2) half of the mothers received WIC while pregnant; (3) 18 percent reported problems with their current living situation; (4) 20 percent reported they will need help finding a job or work training; (5) 40 percent reported needing help arranging child care to return to work or school; and (6) 95 percent of the mothers were classified as being in poor mental health.

AB  - Pupils with Compensatory Educational Needs (PCEN) provides New York State funding for remediation in reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies for eligible high school students. During summer 1993, 30,195 students took PCEN-funded summer classes. About two percent were enrolled in Project Outreach, a program for high school dropouts resuming their education and other high-risk students. The program met or exceeded its evaluation objectives. Overall, at least 79 percent of PCEN students with valid data passed at least one course, and 54 percent of those taking a Regents Competency Test passed the test; however, less than 50 percent passed the reading mathematics, and science tests. Fifty-seven percent of students in Project Outreach passed Regents examinations they took, and the passing rates for individual tests for these students were higher than those of other PCEN students. All Project Outreach students who took a Regents writing test passed it. The Office of Educational Research recommends that special attention be focused on increasing the percentage of students who pass Regents examinations in mathematics, reading, and science. Three tables present evaluation findings. (SLD)

AB  - This report evaluated a project designed to identify, locate, and assist high school dropouts in Oahu, Hawaii. The study group consisted of 105 males and 145 females. Former dropouts were used as outreach aides to: (1) contact potential dropouts in the schools, and (2) to assist the student in resolving his difficulty. The study revealed that most students dropping out of school value education and find it personally desirable. This became clear after an attempt to steer students to the Employment Opportunity Center was unsuccessful. Some proposals were: (1) get students and teachers together outside of the classroom to discuss what each of them likes, and (2) schools must pay attention to morality and values. The report is divided into three parts: (1) the Aide Training Program, (2) the Students, and (3) the Jobs. A general discussion of dropouts, some concluding remarks and some recommendations for further projects follow. (Author/EK)

AB  - The Runaway Youth Act authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to make grants to local nonprofit, private agencies to develop local facilities that would deal primarily with the immediate needs of runaway youth. The Youth Development Bureau of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare) administers this National Runaway Youth Program. The services funded are in three general categories: multiservice youth agencies, youth and family services, and runaway youth shelters. The Youth Development Bureau, in its efforts to increase organizational development and the provision of services by runaway programs, has developed a series of program performance standards. They deal with program accessibility and services, outreach, temporary shelter, the intake process, family counseling, service linkages, aftercare, case disposition, staffing and staff development, youth participation, youth files, project planning and development, and advocacy. Program evaluations have found them to be diverse but generally effective in meeting the variety of needs of runaway youth. Persistent legal issues bearing upon the implementation of runaway programs are compulsory education laws; child labor laws; the need for parental consent for medical services; and harboring, contributing to the delinquency of, or interfering with a minor. Data are provided from a 1975 evaluation of runaway programs. Notes accompany each chapter.

AB  - This study evaluated the effects of a peer-peer depression outreach program for college students (Depression OutReach Alliance [DORA] College Program). Fifty-six college students participated in either the DORA program or a control program and completed pretest, posttest, and follow-up assessments. These assessments measured responses to and desired social distance from an at-risk male peer, self-stigma and perceived social stigma associated with psychological help-seeking, knowledge of depression and suicide, and crisis response skills. Results indicated that DORA participants reported improved crisis response skills, t(50) = 2.55, p = .014, d = .71, desired less social distance from the distressed peer, t(26) = 3.07, p = .005, d = -.60, and perceived there to be less social stigma related to seeking psychological help after the intervention, t(26) = 2.71, p = .012, d = -.52. Implications for college student depression and suicide outreach are discussed.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Studies of injection drug use cessation have largely sampled adults in drug treatment settings. Little is known about injection cessation and relapse among young injection drug users (IDU) in the community. Methods: A total of 365 HCV-negative IDU under age 30 years were recruited by street outreach and interviewed quarterly for a prospective cohort between January 2000 and February 2008. Participants were followed for a total of 638 person-years and 1996 visits. We used survival analysis techniques to identify correlates of injection cessation (≥3 months) and relapse to injection. Results: 67% of subjects were male, median age was 22 years (interquartile range (IQR) 20–26) and median years injecting was 3.6 (IQR 1.3–6.5). 28.8% ceased injecting during the follow-up period. Among those that ceased injecting, nearly one-half resumed drug injection on subsequent visits, one-quarter maintained injecting cessation, and one-quarter were lost to follow-up. Participating in a drug treatment program in the last 3 months and injecting less than 30 times per month were associated with injection cessation. Injecting heroin or heroin mixed with other drugs, injecting the residue from previously used drug preparation equipment, drinking alcohol, and using benzodiazepines were negatively associated with cessation. Younger age was associated with relapse to injection. Conclusion: These results suggest that factors associated with stopping injecting involve multiple areas of intervention, including access to drug treatment and behavioral approaches to reduce injection and sustain cessation. The higher incidence of relapse in the younger subjects in this cohort underscores the need for earlier detection and treatment programs targeted to adolescents and transition-age youth.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the relationship between social exclusion and outcomes of mentally ill patients with substance abuse problems receiving assertive outreach treatment in London. Method: Analysis was conducted on data on 580 patients from the ‘Pan-London Assertive Outreach Study (PLAO)’. Data were collected using clinician-rated scales of alcohol and drug abuse in the last 6 months before baseline. Outcomes – hospitalization and compulsory hospitalization– were assessed over a 9-month follow-up period. Results: The analysis identified a group of patients with substance abuse who suffer from social exclusion and forensic problems ( n = 77, 15.8%), and had poorer outcomes than the rest of the patients in terms of hospitalization (52% vs. 36% respectively) and compulsory (39% vs. 22% respectively) hospitalization. Conclusion: There is a distinct group of patients whose treatment requires social inclusion and forensic expertise. Future research into which model of service is suitable for these patients and in what setting is recommended.

AB  - Homeless, street-dwelling youths are an at-risk population who often use survival behaviors to meet their basic needs. The traditional outreach approach brings services into the streets, yet does not adequately replace the youths' high-risk behaviors. Similarly, job training programs often fail to address the mental health issues that constitute barriers to their productive employment. Drawing on social development principles, the Social Enterprise Intervention (SEI) model is proposed as an alternative approach. The SEI seeks the tripartite effect of employment, service-related, and mental health outcomes for street youths. This article compares existing intervention models and suggests that through the SEI, homeless youths can acquire vocational and business skills, clinical mentorship, and linkages to services that otherwise would not be available to them, given their street-dwelling status.

AB  - Discusses the service model used by the Greater Bridgeport Adolescent Pregnancy Program (GBAPP), which provides sex education and pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prevention via the Teen Outreach and Primary Services (TOPS) project. TOPS uses a teen-focused community outreach model to expand and ensure access to health and support services for primarily underserved inner-city minority adolescents and young adults (aged 13–27 yrs) at risk for or living with HIV. The program provides outreach, case management, HIV counseling and testing, risk-reduction activities, and referrals for housing, entitlements, specialty HIV clinics, and substance abuse counseling and treatment. A group of peer educators recruited from among the target population is trained and paired with the staff to provide outreach services, peer counseling, and education, and to assist with recreational opportunities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine substance abuse treatment referrals that were made by outreach workers in a homeless outreach project. Ten outreach workers completed questionnaires on each of their clients who they had referred to a substance abuse treatment program over the previous year. Additional data was collected on the client's motivation level at the point the referral was made, which agencies the client was referred to, and if the client was rejected from any of the treatment programs. Bivariate correlation analyses were used to examine relationships between the variables. Of 73 project clients who were referred to substance abuse treatment in a one-year period of time, 41% successfully entered treatment. As might be expected, there was a statistically significant relationship between clients' motivation level and completed referral, and between referrals made and program acceptance. This study provides evidence that assertive outreach is effective in engaging and linking homeless persons with substance use disorders to substance abuse treatment services.

AB  - Some facts about the homeless population in Florida are the following: (1) 40,000 persons in Florida are homeless on any given day, with 40 percent of the total being families; (2) 65 percent are new homeless (not chronic); (3) 30 percent of the homeless are addicted to drugs or alcohol and 20 percent are mentally ill; (4) causes of homelessness include a lack of affordable housing, unemployment and low wages, substance abuse and mental illness, family disintegration, migration, and illiteracy; and (5) single women heads of households are particularly vulnerable to homelessness. Attempts to alleviate the problem of homelessness in Florida include implementation of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act's Adult Education for the Homeless (AEH) program, which provides a basis for local programs that include outreach, cooperation with employment and training and other social service agencies, individualized instruction, written goals, a reasonable budget, and an evaluation plan. More than $500,000 has been provided to Florida in AEH funds for 1993-94 year. The AEH program includes the following components: collaboration with rehabilitation and treatment programs; self-esteem, social interaction, and coping skills training, General Educational Development (GED) test instruction; referrals to meet survival needs; adult basic education, with emphasis on functional skills; and linkage to jobs, and vocational and other training. During the 1992-93 program year, approximately 3,200 homeless people in Florida received instructional services through the AEH program through seven local agencies at numerous sites. Approximately half the participants were Black, one-third were White, 12 percent were Hispanic, and 1 percent were other ethnic groups. The largest number of participants were aged 25-44, followed by the 16-24 age group and the 45-59 age group. The following results were found: 1,358 students improved their basic skills; 2,207 learned reading, writing, and mathematics; 60 obtained a high school diploma or passed the GED test; 115 completed beginning classes in English as a Second Language; and 169 obtained a job.

AB  - Six agencies in Illinois received 18 months of funding from the governor's office to develop effective and innovative strategies to recruit young children from traditionally underserved families into early childhood education (ECE) programs. The five agencies that provided families with immediate follow-up and some services shortly after recruitment were able to maintain contact with families while those families waited for their child to be enrolled. Most agencies reported enrollment delays because of waiting lists. Agencies that provided "interim services," such as weekly preschool activities or a monthly home visit, reported retaining the largest number of families for future enrollment in ECE programs. In addition, agencies indicated that it was essential to "go to" families to assist them with enrollment-related paperwork and not expect families to come to the agency. Collaborating with other agencies that provide additional services to families living at or near the poverty level was another important factor for retaining families for future enrollment. A research team at the University of Illinois conducted the evaluation of the program. Each of the six agencies participated in three evaluation interviews scheduled at the beginning, middle, and end of the funding period as well as an optional monthly teleconference call to share information and solve problems. The research team used the interviews and teleconferences to evaluate the effectiveness of the six agencies' recruitment strategies.

AB  - Presents an attempt to overcome a number of the defects customarily attributed to conventional measures in formal tests for individuals from culturally deprived and poverty-level backgrounds by the construction and application of a test battery tailored specifically in content, format, and administration to disadvantaged adolescent groups. The measures were administered to 256 male and female high school dropouts enrolled in a federally funded, youth-work training program. Results based upon item characteristics, levels of internal consistency, validity, the interpretability of the factor patterns, and various research findings suggest that the measures and the techniques utilized in their design warrant further development and research application.

AB  - This report presents the results of an 18-month research project that studied the effectiveness of youth work with vulnerable young people. The research, representing six distinct geographical areas of Scotland characterized by disadvantage, focused on young people aged 13 to 16. In each neighborhood, the project examined the experiences of young people and youth work service providers that serve vulnerable young populations. The areas included inner city areas, smaller towns, and rural areas. In each locale, questionnaires were completed (nearly 1,200 in all) and focus groups were held with students in local secondary schools. It was evident from the way that young people used their leisure time that the transition from organized activities for groups to more casual leisure activities can increase vulnerability. Organized youth work had the greatest appeal for those under age 14; older adolescents tended to "hang around" with friends. About half the girls and 6 in 10 of the boys were currently involved in some sort of youth club or activity, with participation decreasing with age. Membership in such organizations was less common among these disadvantaged adolescents than for a nationally representative sample reported by other researchers. Survey findings showed that the most vulnerable youth were the least likely to participate in organized activities, and current membership in a youth group was not associated of itself with a reduction in risk. Attending a youth club, however, meant less time spent on the street which in turn could indirectly reduce risk. In most areas there was extensive and varied provision for young people, but it was difficult to determine the extent of programming and the extent of use. Suggestions, many centering on financial support, are made for meeting the needs of youth programs in Scotland. Four appendixes contain questionnaires, a youth service group involvement grid, and a schedule of youth work providers. (Contains 14 figures, 31 tables, and 92 references.) (SLD)

AB  - Abstract: Introduction: Prevention of psychosis has become a major objective of modern clinical psychiatry. An increasing number of new services have been established in Europe and in the world. The OASIS team has become an established model where clinical practice and research are fully integrated in the field of preventative interventions in psychosis. Method: Comprehensive analysis of different clinical and service measures describing the 2001–2011 implementation of the OASIS team. Results: Over the last decade, the OASIS team has received a total of 1102 referrals, mostly young males from ethnic minorities. After the assessment, 35% were diagnosed with an At Risk Mental State (ARMS) while 32% were already psychotic. Within the ARMS, 70% met the inclusion criteria for the attenuated psychotic symptoms subgroup, 1% met the inclusion criteria for the genetic deterioration syndrome, 9% met inclusion criteria for a brief and self-limited intermittent psychotic episode and the others met inclusion criteria for more than one subgroup. Most of them had at least one comorbid diagnosis, mainly relating to anxiety and depressive domains. The majority of the OASIS clients received cognitive behavioural therapy alone or in combination with antidepressants/antipsychotics. Over the 2-year follow-up time, 44 subjects (15.2%) developed a frank psychotic episode. Conclusions: The OASIS service represents one of the largest and most established prodromal services in the world. The burden of research evidence and the translational impact produced on the clinical practice support the OASIS as a model for the development of similar services.

AB  - As the Latino population in the United States experiences rapid growth, the well-being of Latino adolescents is a growing concern because of their high rates of mental health problems. Latino adolescents have higher rates of mental health problems than their peers, including depressive symptoms, suicide attempts, and violence. Sophisticated, realistic health promotion efforts are needed to reduce these risk behaviors and enhance protective factors. Parents and schools can be key protective factors, or assets, in adolescents’ lives. This article details the steps undertaken to develop Project Wings Home Visits, a collaborative school-based, community-linked mental health promotion intervention for Latino adolescents and their families. Core to the intervention is the use of a community health worker model to provide home-based outreach and education to parents of Latino adolescents. The intervention was developed using a community-based participatory research approach that involved the cooperation of a community health care system, a public high school, and a university. Our process demonstrates the benefits, strengths, and challenges of using community-based participatory research in creating and implementing health promotion interventions.

AB  - This article describes the three-decade experience in model development and replication and in introducing and sustaining organization change of Child Development Resources (CDR), of Williamsburg, Virginia. CDR provides an integrated system of services for children with disabilities and developmental delays as well as for children who are at risk. Since 1975, CDR has successfully won and completed 29 model demonstration and outreach projects. Most models have been widely replicated and their materials used throughout the country. Listening to families and professionals define their needs is at the heart of CDR's model development. The author identifies and describes three sets of factors for successful model development and replication: (1) factors related to the model; (2) characteristics of the replication site; and (3) elements of the change or replication process used to ensure that replication will be carried out with fidelity to the original model and will achieve the anticipated results in the new site.

AB  - Background: Sufficient sample size and minimal sample bias are core requirements for empirical data analyses. Combining opportunistic recruitment with a Web-based survey and data-collection platform yields new benefits over traditional recruitment approaches. Objective: This paper aims to report the success of different recruitment methods and obtain data on participants' characteristics, participation behavior, recruitment rates, and representativeness of the sample. Methods: A longitudinal, Web-based survey was implemented as part of the European PASTA (Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches) project, between November 2014 and December 2016. During this period, participants were recruited from 7 European cities on a rolling basis. A standardized guide on recruitment strategy was developed for all cities, to reach a sufficient number of adult participants. To make use of the strengths and minimize weakness, a combination of different opportunistic recruitment methods was applied. In addition, the random sampling approach was applied in the city of Orebro. To reduce the attrition rate and improve real-time monitoring, the Web based platform featured a participant's and a researchers' user interface and dashboard. Results: Overall, 10,691 participants were recruited; most people found out about the survey through their workplace or employer (2300/10691, 21.51%), outreach promotion (2219/10691, 20.76%), and social media (1859/10691, 17.39%). The average number of questionnaires filled in per participant varied significantly between the cities (P<.001), with the highest number in Zurich (11.0, SE 0.33) and the lowest in Orebro (4.8, SE 0.17). Collaboration with local organizations, the use of Facebook and mailing lists, and direct street recruitment were the most effective approaches in reaching a high share of participants (P<.001). Considering the invested working hours, Facebook was one of the most time-efficient methods. Compared with the cities' census data, the composition of study participants was broadly representative in terms of gender distribution; however, the study included younger and better-educated participants. Conclusions: We observed that offering a mixed recruitment approach was highly effective in achieving a high participation rate. The highest attrition rate and the lowest average number of questionnaires filled in per participant were observed in Orebro, which also recruited participants through random sampling. These findings suggest that people who are more interested in the topic are more willing to participate and stay in a survey than those who are selected randomly and may not have a strong connection to the research topic. Although direct face-to-face contacts were very effective with respect to the number of recruited participants, recruiting people through social media was not only effective but also very time efficient. The collected data are based on one of the largest recruited longitudinal samples with a common recruitment strategy in different European cities.

AB  - The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act authorizes funds under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 for community-based centers that serve the shelter needs of runaway or homeless youths. To examine the effectiveness of the programs and the characteristics of program participants, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) visited 17 runaway and homeless youth centers in 13 states to observe program operations, gather statistical information from the administrators, and to interview 353 persons associated with the centers including residents, parents of former residents, staff members, and community service personnel. The GAO's findings were generally favorable and indicated that the programs were operating as intended by the statute. The majority of the youths sheltered were from the immediate geographic area and were not psychotic, violent, or substance-abusers. Staff members estimated that 20 to 40 percent had been physically abused and 14 to 35 percent were victims of parental neglect. Services offered included family and individual counseling, and outreach activities. Less than 50 percent of the youths were counseled after leaving the center. The majority of the centers were clean, well-kept, and adequately furnished, and had written rules of behavior. The very fact of the program's existence was cited as its greatest strength. Inadequate funding was cited as the major weakness. Participants' suggestions for improvement included expansion of the outreach and prevention services, increased networking with other agencies, expansion of activities and training for youths, and enhancement of the physical condition of the shelters. The GAO suggested that more attention should be given to aftercare, outreach to high-risk youths on the street, and activities that develop coping and living skills. (JAC)

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Independent Living (IL) program targeting foster youths to prepare them for effective adulthood. The study employed a pre-post, two-group comparative research design. The IL group was composed of 49 young adults who participated in the IL or SIL (subsidized IL) program prior to their emancipation from foster care (mean age, 20.6 years). The comparison was made up of 18 young adults who experienced foster care but never participated in the IL or SIL programs (mean age, 20.2 years). Data were collected via a mailed survey that included the Daniel Memorial Independent Living Assessment (DMILA) and an additional questionnaire developed by the researcher. The study also examined: (1) why youth in foster care do not participate in IL programs, (2) how participating youth evaluate IL services and what recommendations they make to improve services, and (3) the internal consistency of the DMILA. Results suggest that the DMILA assessment has mediocre reliability. IL program participation is associated with better educational, employment, income, housing, early parenting-prevention, transportation, anger control, criminal-prevention, and self-evaluation outcomes. However, IL participation is not associated with better social support, perceived parenting competence, substance abuse-prevention, sexual risk-prevention outcomes, increased knowledge in money management skills, job seeking and job maintenance skills, interpersonal skills, or lower depression. Results also suggest that the outreach activities of the IL program may be flawed. IL participants reported the IL program was doing best in educational preparation, criminal involvement prevention, and money management preparation and least well in parenting preparation, housing preparation, employment preparation, and substance abuse prevention. To improve services, youths recommended primarily that IL counselors develop closer relationships with youths, that IL training better address organizational skills, and that monthly subsidy be raised and SIL eligibility requirements softened. The study's political context and limitations are also discussed and implications are derived regarding prevention, intervention, outreach, mentorship, empowerment, cross-systems collaboration, and future research.

AB  - Street Kids opens a window to the largely hidden world of street youth. Drawing on their compelling narratives to give new insight into the experiences of youth homelessness and youth outreach, Gibson argues that the enforcement of quality of life ordinances in New York City has, alarmingly, spurred hyper-mobility amongst the street youth population. These youth in motion, resultingly, have become socially invisible and marginalized from public spaces where social workers traditionally contact them, jeopardizing their access to the already limited opportunities to escape street life. Street Kids illustrates the critical role that public space regulations and policing play in shaping the experience of youth homelessness and the effectiveness and limits of street outreach.

AB  - From January 1978 through December 1980, Girls Clubs of America (GCA) and affiliates in seven cities across the country undertook a major project to reach out and serve new communities and girls, particularly girls whose backgrounds and behavior placed them at risk of involvement in the juvenile justice system. The seven clubs involved were Allentown, Pa; Birmingham, Ala.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Lynn, Mass.; Omaha, Neb.; Santa Barbara, Calif.; and Worcester, Mass. Funding for the GCA Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Project (JDPP) was from the Federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The JDPP served a little over 2,000 girls in the project's first 2 years. Most of the girls came from communities characterized by high unemployment, family instability, widespread crime, truancy, significant school dropout rates, and a high incidence of teenage pregnancy. Outreach strategies were developed to attract girls who were apathetic, rebellious, or already involved in the juvenile justice system. Outreach included the use of mobile units, street work, and formal linkages with schools, probation departments, and local housing authorities. The clubs served the girls at risk by developing special programs to address their needs. Programs included sexuality education and career exploration. The clubs increased their capacity to serve girls at risk by maintaining successful JDPP programs beyond the grant period and revising ongoing planning, programming, and evaluation procedures to ensure high quality programs. Programs and program development are discussed in detail, along with staff development and community collaboration and networking.

AB  - The Chicago Youth Development Project was an action-research program jointly undertaken by the Chicago Boys Club and the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research to test whether a program of aggressive street work and community organization in the core of a city could reduce delinquency among youth living there. The report presents a comprehensive account of what was actually done and with what effect, providing the most complete and objective information obtainable, demonstrating to what degree this kind of program can achieve its goals and suggesting what improvements are needed for an even greater impact. The study compares the effects, over five years, of the program in two inner city areas with comparable control areas nearby on such variables as delinquency rates, youth employment rates, school attendance, and adults' satisfaction with their community. The researchers conclude that the project made negligible impact on these respects, but that when boys' expectations of their eventual educational attainment were raised, their delinquency declined. Based on this finding, the researchers suggest that effective future programs will concurrently open educational and vocational opportunities and prepare youngsters to grasp them, fashioning new ways for some adolescents to be students.

AB  - THE TARGET POPULATION WAS SIXTEEN-TO-EIGHTEEN-YEAR OLD SCHOOL DROPOUTS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE 'UNEMPLOYABLE' YOUTH. THE FOUR PROGRAMS VARIED IN SERVICES OFFERED AND WERE ADMINISTERED BETWEEN 1962 AND 1965 BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES CHOSEN BY THE NEW YORK STATE DIVISION FOR YOUTH AND THE NEW YORK CITY YOUTH BOARD AS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES OF A MODEL PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY THE STATE DIVISION FOR YOUTH. THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED SUPERVISED WORK EXPERIENCE, GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING, REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION IN READING, ARITHMETIC, JOB REFERRAL, JOB SKILLS TRAINING, AND TRADE TRAINING. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PROJECT GOALS, A NUMBER OF ANALYSES WERE UNDERTAKEN. EXAMINED WERE: THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBJECTS; EMPLOYMENT CRITERIA; THE EFFECTS OF THE SET OF FOUR PROGRAMS ON THE TRAINEES' EMPLOYMENT; DIFFERENTIAL PROGRAM EFFECTS ON EMPLOYMENT; PROGRAM EFFECT ON EMPLOYMENT AS A FUNCTION OF THE SUBJECTS' SOCIAL BACKGROUND AND PERSONAL HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS; PROGRAM EFFECTS ON SCHOOL RETURN, OCCUPATIONAL ASPIRATION, AND POST-PROGRAM ARRESTS; EXTENT OF SERVICES RENDERED SUBJECTS BY ALL COMMUNITY AGENCIES; ATTITUDES OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS TOWARD THE PROGRAMS AND PARTICULAR SERVICES RENDERED; AND EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCES OF SUBJECTS. A RANDOMIZED CONTROL GROUP WAS USED FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES. PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF DATA WERE FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS FOCUSING ON JOB HISTORY AND DISPOSITIONAL INFORMATION FROM COLLATERAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION. A FACTOR ANALYSIS WAS UTILIZED TO ASSIST IN THE DETERMINATION OF REASONABLE EMPLOYMENT CRITERIA, AND A MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ANALYZE THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS OF PROGRAMS ON THESE CRITERIA. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE JOB EXPERIENCES OF YOUTHS DERIVED FOUR DIMENSIONS THAT APPEARED MOST RELEVANT TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT - SUPPORTIVE CONTEXT OF JOB, RATE OF JOB AND FIELD MOBILITY, JOB ACHIEVEMENT, AND PERSISTENCE. THE PROGRAMS APPEARED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON ONE OF THESE DIMENSIONS - JOB AND FIELD MOBILITY - BUT SHOWED NO EFFECT ON THE OTHER THREE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE LOCUS OF PROGRAM EFFECT WAS ON THE ATIITUDES OF YOUTHS TOWARD JOBS, RATHER THAN THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE JOBS AVAILABLE TO THE SUBJECTS AFTER TRAINING. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE FINDINGS IN THIS STUDY THROW DOUBT UPON THE IDEA THAT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE YOUTH AND WORK TRAINING PROGRAMS WILL MARKEDLY AFFECT THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION OF SCHOOL DROPOUTS IN URBAN POVERTY NEIGHBORHOODS, WHILE INDICATING THAT SUCH PROGRAMS DO HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR OF YOUTHS WITH RESPECT TO MAINTAINING JOBS. EVALUATORS SUGGEST THAT PROGRAMS WOULD BE IMPROVED IF THE YOUTHS WERE: DIFFERENTIATED ACCORDING TO NEED AND SELECTED WHEN THEIR VOCATIONAL NEEDS WERE MET BY THE TRAINING OFFERED; TRAINED FOR THE JOBS THEY WILL HOLD AFTER TRAINING; CHANNELED TO JOBS THEY WERE WILLING TO MAINTAIN; AND ASSISTED TO COPE WITH JOBS BY SUPPORTIVE THERAPEUTIC COUNSELING OR OTHER SERVICES AIMED AT MAXIMAL ADAPTATION TO THE JOB. AN EXTENSIVE APPENDIX CONTAINS ALL PROGRAM DATA AND DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING INTERVIEW FORMS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS. A TOTAL OF 145 TABLES OF DATA ARE INCLUDED IN BOTH THE BODY OF THE REPORT AND AS APPENDED MATERIAL. (AUTHOR ABSTRACT MODIFIED)

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Several studies have reported pronounced racial/ethnic differences in smoking behavior among homeless youth. Better understanding the factors underlying racial/ethnic differences in daily smoking among homeless youth may help inform programs to reduce smoking in this population.<bold>Methods: </bold>Data come from a probability sample of homeless youth in Los Angeles County collected between 2008 and 2009. The sample includes 116 African American, 99 Hispanic, and 119 White youth with ages ranging from 13 to 24 years. Chi-square tests were used to test the differences in daily smoking among African American, Hispanic, and White youth. Propensity score and doubly robust methods were used to produce a less biased estimate of the association between daily smoking and race/ethnicity after having removed the effect of potential confounders.<bold>Results: </bold>The daily smoking rate for White youth was 70.1%, more than 31 percentage points than the rates for either African American or Hispanic youth. Propensity score analysis revealed that the majority of the racial/ethnic differences in smoking rates could be explained by differences in homelessness severity, although background characteristics and comorbidity were relevant as well.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>As programs are developed to reduce smoking among homeless youth, results suggest that additional outreach may be needed to engage White youth in services. Also, smoking prevention programs may benefit from incorporating a social network-based approach that assists youth in fostering relationships with lower-risk peers, as well as addressing other forms of substance use. Incorporating these elements may help reduce the large racial/ethnic disparities in daily smoking among homeless youth.<bold>Implications: </bold>This report extends the small existing literature on racial/ethnic differences in smoking among homeless youth in two important respects. First, it confirms differences in daily smoking, an important indicator of dependence, across racial/ethnic groups. Second, it seeks to understand the extent to which differences in smoking can be explained by demographic characteristics (other than race/ethnicity), background factors, homelessness severity, and comorbidity characteristics known to be associated with substance use among homeless youth.

AB  - An experimental outreach program offered shelter-based support groups or phone counseling to battered women in the criminal and civil courts. The outreach project attempted to contact 1,895 eligible women drawn from the court dockets. Nearly 50% of these women could not be reached, another third refused services, and about a fifth of the women accepted either the shelter-based counseling or phone counseling. However, only 19% ( n = 71) of those who accepted service (or less than 4% of the total eligible women) actually participated in the service. The women refused services primarily because they did not feel they needed them; they accepted service mainly to get help with their emotions. The women who participated in the shelter-based counseling tended to be of a higher social economic status than women who generally contacted the courts. The main problems for the women in phone counseling was recurring abuse from their partners and getting help for their children. The findings may suggest different types of battered women that warrant different strategies to reach them. The outreach efforts might be further developed, as well, to more actively recruit and engage women in general.

AB  - Many federal, state, and local education policy priorities are aimed at preparing high school students, especially those at risk, to be college- and career-ready when they graduate from high school. A number of programs across different institutional entities have been initiated to achieve these goals, encompassing individual partnerships with schools. Many of these programs include a variety of interventions, ranging from college and course counseling to college visits. Although there have been some evaluations of the larger federal programs, and some state and district programs, few have examined national observational data on the impact of these programmatic efforts on college enrollments. This study uses the HSLS:09 database to investigate the impact of specific treatments in at-risk schools on college enrollments. Results show that several of these programmatic initiatives have a positive effect on college enrollment; however, the effects are small compared to some of those reported by other national studies.

AB  - BackgroundInternational agreement dictates that clients must be help-seeking before any assessment or intervention can be implemented by an ‘at-risk service’. Little is known about individuals who decline input. This study aimed to define the size of the unengaged population of an ‘at-risk service’, to compare this group to those who did engage in terms of sociodemographic and clinical features and to assess the clinical outcomes of those who did not engage with the service.MethodGroups were compared using data collected routinely as part of the service's clinical protocol. Data on service use and psychopathology since referral to Outreach and Support in South London (OASIS) were collected indirectly from clients' general practitioners (GPs) and by screening electronic patient notes held by the local Mental Health Trust.ResultsOver one-fifth (n=91, 21.2%) of those referred did not attend or engage with the service. Approximately half of this group subsequently received a diagnosis of mental illness. A diagnosis of psychosis was given to 22.6%. Nearly 70% presented to other mental health services. There were no demographic differences, except that those who engaged with the service were more likely to be employed.ConclusionsOver one-fifth of those referred to services for people at high risk of psychosis do not attend or engage. However, many of this group require mental health care, and a substantial proportion has, or will later develop, psychosis. A more assertive approach to assessing individuals who are at high risk of psychosis but fail to engage may be indicated.

AB  - Objectives: The current study sought to test hard drug use outcomes for youth receiving a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention that linked youth to either a shelter or a drop-in center. Methods: Homeless youth (14–24 years old) were engaged by research assistants (RAs) at soup kitchens, parks, libraries, and other locations that homeless youth were known to frequent. Youth were randomly assigned to receive six months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Hard drug use over time was the main outcome. Intervention condition and service connection were used as predictors for the baseline level and the slope of change in hard drug use over time. Data analysis was conducted with Bernoulli Hierarchical Generalized Linear Modeling in HLM7. Results: The current study found that those who were in the drop-in linkage condition exhibited a greater reduction in their odds of using hard drugs during the follow-up points than their counterparts in the shelter linkage condition. And finally, those who utilized services more often during the follow-ups were those who exhibited less hard drug use at baseline and less reduction in their odds of using hard drugs. Conclusions: This study suggests that drop-in centers, which are often characterized by low-demand programming and few behavioral restrictions, are effective for addressing hard drug use among homeless youth.

AB  - This study examined prevalence of sexual risks among homeless adolescents and described factors associated with those risks. Community-based outreach methods were used successfully to access this difficult-to-reach population. The sample included 203 homeless youth aged 15-22 recruited from community sites. Questionnaire items addressed demographics, sexual behaviors, alcohol/drug use, STI history and testing, and pregnancy history. In cross-sectional analysis, 58.7% of males and 75.6% of females reported recent sexual intercourse. Of those, one third of males and half of the females used no barrier method with at least one partner. Both gender (female) and race/ethnicity (non-Black) were associated with having intercourse without a barrier contraceptive method. Over one fifth reported a history of "survival sex" or receiving money, drugs, clothing, shelter, or food for sex. These results show disturbingly high rates of a number of sexual risks, reinforcing the need for targeted interventions with this highly vulnerable population.

AB  - THE PROJECT ASSIGNS ALLEGED DELINQUENTS TO THEIR OWN OR SURROGATE HOMES UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF AN OUTREACH WORKER. OBJECTIVES WERE TO SERVE A CLIENTELE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE HELD IN SECURE DETENTION UNTIL FORMAL DISPOSITION OF THEIR CASES, TO SAVE THE COMMUNITY APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT IT WOULD NORMALLY COST TO DETAIN THEM IN A SECURE FACILITY, AND TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO SUPERVISE MANY CHILDREN OUTSIDE OF SECURE DETENTION. THIS EVALUATION WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: (1) TO DOCUMENT PROGRAM PROGRESS IN MEETING STATED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES; (2) TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN PROGRAM OPERATION; (3) TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MIGHT REMEDY IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS; AND (4) TO PROVIDE DECISIONMAKING BODIES WITH INFORMATION NECESSARY TO RENDER JUDGMENTS WITH REGARD TO FUNDING. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH INSTRUMENT WAS A CLIENT DATA FORM DEVELOPED THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH PROJECT STAFF. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION IS EXAMINED WITH EMPHASIS ON PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT. A DISCUSSION OF CLIENT INTAKE AND TERMINATION IS FOLLOWED BY DETAILS ON CLIENT PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING NEW POLICE CONTACTS AND CHARGES, RETURNS TO SECURE DETENTION, AND A SUMMARY OF SUCCESSES AND FAILURES. PROGRAM SUPERVISION AND SERVICES ARE DISCUSSED AND SYSTEM IMPACT IS ASSESSED IN TERMS OF THE USE OF SECURE DETENTION, THE FINANCIAL IMPACT, AND JUDICIAL DISPOSITION INFLUENCE. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS IS PRESENTED OF THREE HOME DETENTION PROJECTS, WITH ATTENTION TO PROJECT AND CLIENT CHARACTERISTICS, SUCCESSES AND FAILURES, AND SYSTEM IMPACTS. PROJECT PROBLEMS AND POLICY ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED IN RELATION TO PROJECT CASELOADS, THE USE OF SECURE DETENTION, CLIENT SUPERVISION AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT, LOCATION AND LOGISTICS, AND STAFF TRAINING. FINALLY, PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR EACH OUTREACH SERVICE AND OUTCOME OBJECTIVE ARE DETAILED. APPENDED MATERIALS INCLUDE A CLIENT DATA FORM, THE PROBATION OFFICER QUESTIONNAIRE, EXCERPTS FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE, AND A NOTE ON STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES. GRAPHIC AND TABULAR DATA ARE PROVIDED.

AB  - Refugees in the United States often deal with multiple difficulties such as sequalae of trauma, psychiatric diagnoses, and resettlement stress. Despite the need for intervention, many refugees face barriers to accessing and engaging in mental health treatment. Although many studies address ways to increase treatment engagement for "hard-to-reach" populations, such as at-risk youth or the severely and persistently mentally ill, few studies have examined this issue for refugees specifically. The current study adopted an exploratory approach to examine clinician and case manager outreach to refugee children as a possible tool for increasing client engagement in treatment. Demographic data were collected for 103 refugee children from 35 different countries receiving treatment at a Chicago mental-health clinic. Data were also collected on clinician and case manager outreach activities, and the children's function was assessed at 3 month intervals over a period of three years. Results indicated clinicians and case managers tended to extend outreach prior to enrollment in treatment more frequently to children with trauma histories, to children with undocumented or refugee status, and to those with greater material need disruption. Findings also suggested that clients who received outreach prior to enrollment in the clinic were less likely to drop out of treatment. Outreach did not demonstrate a measurable impact on treatment outcomes for the children in the study, however. Thus, the results of the study provided an initial suggestion that outreach prior to client enrollment in treatment may be a factor that can help refugee children and families overcome barriers to accessing and engaging in treatment.

AB  - The program provided funding for 164 runaway youth programs which have provided services to over 43,000 runaway youths and their families located in 47 States, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and Guam. It continued funding for demonstration projects and for the toll-free communications system to serve runaways and their families. It implemented and automated a management information system, developed a contract to conduct a statewide demonstration project within the Ohio Network of Runaway Youth Services, developed model regulations for runaway youth legislation, and provided technical assistance and training through a contractor for 164 grantees. The program's essential services (outreach, information and referral, individual intake and counseling, and temporary shelter), supplementary services, (family counseling, medical and legal services, and advocacy), and procedural requirements (referral linkages) are all intended to meet the program's legislative goals. Runaway youth centers are serving distinct youth populations: runaways, youths encouraged to leave their homes, youths who leave home with the knowledge/approval of their parents, potential runaways, youths in crisis who are not planning to run away, and other youths coming to the project for services. Most youths served by the projects are runaways and female, between the ages of 14 and 17 years old, white, and had been living at home with their parents. Youths blame poor communication with their parents as the main reason for seeking services, and most seek services on their own. Current demonstration projects are described, and a list of 1979 program grantees by region/State and level of support is included. An evaluation report on the program is appended. Tabular data are included.

AB  - Purpose: Communities That Care (CTC) is a prevention system designed to reduce levels of adolescent delinquency and substance use through the selection and use of effective preventive interventions tailored to a community's specific profile of risk and protection. This article describes early findings from the first group-randomized trial of CTC. Methods: A panel of 4,407 fifth-grade students was surveyed annually through seventh grade. Analyses were conducted to assess the effects of CTC on reducing levels of targeted risk factors and reducing initiation of delinquent behavior and substance use in seventh grade, 1.67 years after implementing preventive interventions selected through the CTC process. Results: Mean levels of targeted risks for students in seventh grade were significantly lower in CTC communities compared with controls. Significantly fewer students in CTC communities than in control communities initiated delinquent behavior between grades 5 and 7. No significant intervention effect on substance use initiation by spring of seventh grade was observed. Conclusions: CTC's theory of change hypothesizes that it takes from 2 to 5 years to observe community-level effects on risk factors and 5 or more years to observe effects on adolescent delinquency or substance use. The early findings indicating hypothesized effects of CTC on targeted risk factors and initiation of delinquent behavior are promising. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Community-based early intervention strategies can provide students with skills and attitudes that make dropping out of high school an unnecessary choice. This report analyzes the high school dropout phenomenon in terms of its magnitude, influence on minority populations, and need for local outreach programs. In California, the dropout rate has increased 100 percent since 1970. One in 3 high school students do not graduate, and among minorities, the ratio increases to 5 out of 10. Causes of high dropout rates among minorities include language problems and teacher inability to deal with cultural differences. In an opinion study of predominantly white California elementary teachers, 37 percent reported no cultural awareness workshops relevant to their Black and Hispanic students' backgrounds during the last three years. Local dropout prevention facilities designed to provide remediation, survival skill training, and academic tutoring for secondary students were established through private initiative, but it became evident that students needed assistance before attaining high school status. Consequently, a proposal for an early intervention dropout program was written, and this program, funded by the San Bernardino City Council and assisted by volunteers, provided enhancement support for 130 elementary students for 6 months. Students demonstrated marked improvement in the program's academic disciplines. This program's success suggests that intervention should commence at the elementary level through local collaboration.

AB  - This paper addresses educational reform as it affects dropouts, minorities, diverse cultures, training programs, and community-based education. Effective dropout-prevention models are presented that address the needs of at-risk populations. The author states that much dropout prevention and reclamation takes place off of school district campuses and suggests that many community-based educational programs are having a significant impact on prevention and recovery. Several programs are highlighted such as Alternative Street Academy, Project Early Outreach, Operation RETAIN (Rescue Educational Training and Initiative Now), Teens for Responsible Behavior, Project Earn and Learn, RETAIN II, Operation Reclaim, Operation Read/Project Citizen, and the Substance Abuse and Gang Intervention Program. Several reasons are attributed to the success of these programs, including offering individualized education; having proper role models; having a culturally, ethnically, bilingually, and socioeconomically sensitive staff; and using individualized services from counseling volunteers, universities and colleges, and the community. Despite these efforts, however, the high dropout rate continues unabated, fueled by financial pressures, teen pregnancies, cultural and ethnic differences, and high unemployment. Financing validated, effective programs is part of the solution recommended. Contains 15 references. (GLR)

AB  - This study evaluated an effective outreach treatment program in the Netherlands for chronic, high-risk crack abusers on its adherence to the assertive community treatment model. Fidelity was tested on 25 criteria of the Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale. Adherence was high on several factors: a small caseload, staff capacity, a nurse and a substance abuse specialist on staff, explicit admission criteria, low intake rate, and intensity of service. Future programs that focus on treating crack addiction should implement these components. The outreach treatment program showed low adherence to the assertive community treatment model for including a psychiatrist and a vocational specialist, both of which are important factors that should be implemented in future programs. Other factors were observed to be important for treating this population: a strong focus on the client-therapist relationship, stagewise substance abuse treatment, and on-the-spot incentives to keep this population involved in treatment.

AB  - In a randomized controlled trial the effectiveness of an outreach treatment program (OTP) was compared with standard addiction care services for hard-drug addicts in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). The study aimed at chronic, high-risk crack abusers who were insufficiently engaged in standard addiction treatment services. Data were collected from February 2000 to December 2001. A total of 124 subjects participated in the study at baseline. Follow-up data were available for 94 subjects. Outcome measures included treatment compliance, outcome, and satisfaction. Data were collected by means of monthly registrations, EuropAsi interviews and an evaluation form. There was a high compliance with OTP in the treatment group; the average length-of-stay was 6 months, with visits three times a week. Although both groups were well represented in standard care, participation was mainly based on methadone maintenance. Subjects treated in OTP showed significant improvements in physical health, general living conditions, and psychiatric status, but no change in employment, substance abuse, and legal status. The control group remained almost unchanged. Clients of OTP reported feeling very satisfied with their treatment. On-the-spot incentives and a positive relationship with the care provider were directly associated with treatment retention. An outreach treatment program, as conducted in this study, is associated with high compliance, general improvement, and treatment satisfaction. Characteristics of this treatment modality are (1) assertive outreach, (2) a mixed program with incentives, and (3) a strong focus on individual-bound therapy. Further research is needed with larger groups and similar conditions at baseline assessment.

AB  - The challenges presented by the growing prevalence, burden, and unmet service needs of youth mental health problems are formidable. During the past decade, scholars and other stakeholders of the Missouri Prevention Center (MPC) have been using a prevention and implementation science approach to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate recommended practices in promoting youth mental health in real world contexts. The purpose of this article is to describe the multidisciplinary contributions of MPC to improve the social, emotional, and behavioral health of youth, locally and nationally. We briefly summarize MPC scholarship that has addressed the individual and social- contextual risk and protective factors of youth mental health at home, school, and community. The article concludes with a description of two large-scale community projects, funded by an innovative local sales tax, that represent the systematic application of MPC scholarship and outreach. Together these projects provide mental health screening for every youth in our county three times per year and a single point of entry into the mental health service system where any family in our county can access an evaluation and referral for their child at no cost to them. The projects serve as model demonstrations for how communities can address the challenges of youth mental health concerns through multidisciplinary collaborations.

AB  - This article reports on DAYS (Denver Area Youth Services) model program, La Familia Community Drug and Alcohol Prevention Program which targets the families of high-risk Hispanic youths from 6 to 11 years, and attempts to reduce identified risk factors while simultaneously increasing culturally relevant protective factors. During the two years, the program has enrolled 219 youth and their families utilizing existing community networks and aggressive outreach. The program resulted in a 92% retention rate and over 80% attendance per session. Families became more willing to discuss ATOD (alcohol, tobacco, and other drug) issues openly and made positive steps toward empowerment as a result of the program.

AB  - Boys & Girls Clubs in New York City and Boston participated in a 3-year initiative to provide and enhance services to underserved teens. Researchers collected data via surveys of club members and staff; cost surveys of club administrators; interviews, focus groups, and observations at each club; and attendance information. Results indicated that these voluntary youth-serving organizations drew in many community teens. In 1 year, Boston added from 20-100 new teen members at each club, while New York added from 201-1,100 new teens. Clubs that went beyond recruitment goals experienced difficulty meeting teens' needs. Clubs reached teens with such strategies as increased hours of activities, collaborations with outside agencies, and targeted street outreach. Programs served teens with many needs, though they found this challenging. Sustaining teens' involvement was more difficult than recruitment. Clubs retained a little over half of their target groups for at least a full year. About 40 percent of teens attended less than once a month. Program challenges included hiring appropriate staff, preventing turnover, and providing sufficient staff training. Clubs were quite successful in providing teens with emotional and instrumental support. Over three-quarters of teens reported feeling safe at their clubs. Clubs in both cities invested in improvements in their management information systems. Appendices include youth survey scales and constructs and characteristics of youth survey participants.

AB  - "The Role of Risk: Mentoring Experiences and Outcomes for Youth with Varying Risk Profiles" presents findings from the first large-scale study to examine how the levels and types of risk youth face may influence their relationships with program-assigned mentors and the benefits they derive from these relationships. The study looked closely at the backgroundsof participating youth and their mentors, the mentoring relationships that formed, the program supports that were offered, and the benefits thatyouth accrued--and assessed how these varied for youth with differing "profiles" of risk. Five key findings resulted: (1) Without substantial effort beyond their normal outreach strategies, programs were able to reachand serve youth facing a wide range of challenges; (2) Youth with differing risk "profiles" (that is, levels and types of risk) had relationships of similarstrength and duration and derived similar benefits from program participation; (3) The challenges reported by mentors and the reasons matches ended differed as a function of youth's risk profile; (4) The strongest program benefit, and most consistent across risk groups, was a reduction in depressive symptoms--a particularly noteworthy finding given that almost one in four youth reported worrisome levels of these symptoms at baseline. Findings also suggested gains in social acceptance, academic attitudes and grades. Youth did not appear to benefit in their relationships with parents or in their positive or negative behaviors; and (5) Mentors who received early-match training and consistent program support met more frequently and had longer-lasting relationships with their mentees. Youth whose mentors received training also reported higher-quality relationships. The authors believe the study's results provide useful guidance for practitioners, funders, and policymakers who want to know which youth are best suited for mentoring and how practices might be strengthened to helpensure that youth facing a variety of risks get the most out of their mentoring experience. Seven appendixes are included: (1) Study Method; (2) Analysis of Program Outcomes; (3) Who Were the Mentors?; (4) Measuring Risk; (5) Development and Validation of Mentoring Relationship Quality Scales (by Daniel A. Sass and Michael J. Karcher); (6) Analyses of the Effects of Rematching and Total Time Mentored on Youth Outcomes (by David L. DuBois, Daniel A. Sass and Michael J. Karcher); and (7) Analyses of the Contribution of Case Managers to Mentor Support and Match Outcomes (by Daniel A. Sass and Michael J. Karcher). (Contains 182 endnotes, 30 tables, and 3 figures.)

AB  - This study examined a project that delivered social work services to homeless individuals. A mixed-methods case study was conducted using quantitative and qualitative data from 93 library employees and the project's Homelessness Prevention Outreach Worker (HPOW). There was an increase in the number of clients accessing community supports during the project, and the HPOW was integral to the provision of support and resources to homeless individuals. Staff training was associated with significantly greater knowledge, comfort, and skills in working with homeless individuals. These findings can inform the delivery and implementation of similar programs for homeless individuals.

AB  - Discusses changes in the patterns of homelessness in Denmark and initiatives for the homeless mentally ill. A social-psychiatric, street-level, outreach project is presented in which teams of professionals concentrate their efforts efforts on establishing contact with street-dwellers who have mental health problems and attempt to develop activities directed toward mentally ill homeless people who stay in shelters. Ethical and legal considerations are of such initiatives are discussed. It is argued that the development of street-level projects will go some way toward addressing the complex needs of this group, but a change in attitude is also required in relation to the kinds of treatment and social initiatives that ought to be developed in the future. For example, they might include providing a form of housing in which alcohol/substance abuse is not considered grounds for eviction, or social initiatives whose primary goal is not resocialization, but rather appropriate and continuing health and social care and ongoing contact.

AB  - Risk factors affecting infants and young children, such as mother's drug addiction or teenage pregnancy, are discussed. Four major groups of risk factors are considered: (1) sociocultural and demographic factors; (2) biomedical risks; (3) personal-social risk factors; and (4) family history factors. These risk factors intersect to increase negative outcomes. Where buffering or supportive elements are present, consequences of risk factors are ameliorated. The Syracuse Family Development Research Project found buffering results for a high quality infant-toddler-preschool care program combined with an outreach home visitation program that delivered sensorimotor games, and nutritional and positive discipline information to young, unwed, school-dropout mothers. At least 12 preventive actions should be taken in regards to risk factors. These include mandatory parent education from the early grades, required child development courses in teacher training curriculums, bookmobiles in poor neighborhoods, provision of parental leave, job sharing, positive television programming, and high quality infant and toddler care.

AB  - This study examined whether or not student, parent, and peer engagement factors that contribute to at-risk students' success in graduating from high school continue to be important in making the transition from high school to postsecondary education. The data set used was the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, which included 1994 data obtained two years after students' scheduled high school graduation. At-risk students exhibited two or more of six risk factors, including "family in the lowest socioeconomic quartile" or "held back a grade". Analysis used alternative statistical methodology, specifically regression analysis and the "odds ratios" produced by this procedure. Key findings indicated that: (1) students whose parents frequently discussed school-related matters and/or had high educational expectations were much more likely than other students to enroll in postsecondary education; (2) students who reported that most or all of their high school friends planned to attend college were far more likely to attend themselves; (3) participating in college preparation activities such as gathering information about financial aid increased the odds of enrolling in postsecondary education; and (4) moderate- to high-risk students participating in college outreach programs were more likely to attend college. Appended are a glossary and technical and methodology notes. (Contains 11 references.) (DB)

AB  - A three year program evaluation investigated the primary prevention aspects of Youth Assistance (YA), a community based program of the Oakland County (Michigan) Probate Court providing casework and prevention services. The activites studied included parent education sessions, supervised team recreation, summer camp, scholarships, skill building activities and a one-to-one mentorship program. The goals were to determine how effectively the program succeeded in mobilizing community volunteers and to examine whether the incidence of neglect and delinquency had been reduced as a result of children and parents participating in one or more of these primary prevention activites. Ethnographical as well as quasi-experimental approaches were used. The following results were found: YA primary prevention services do serve 'at risk' populations in the community; overall, participation in the YA activities had positive effects on the participants, such as improved communication skills, increased respect for authority and more use of positive descipline techniques; 92% of the primary prevention program participants had no subsequent contact with YA or the Court; the program is cost-effective. The findings also confirmed that volunteers are an essential part of the success of a community based prevention program. A number of specific recommendations were made which will be implemented over the next few years.

AB  - Despite continued interest in understanding the problem of urban violence in the United States, fundamental scholarly and policy-relevant questions remain regarding the nature of urban violence, its consequences, and the effectiveness of social policy efforts aimed at reducing the harms it causes. This dissertation consists of three papers that address each of these questions. The first paper developed from collaborative research with Anthony Braga, Tracey Shollenberger, and Christopher Winship uses quasi-experimental methods to assess the effectiveness of a gang outreach and mediation 'streetworker' program in Boston. The second paper turns its focus to the primary tool used in the creation of serious urban violence the firearm and makes use of both quantitative and qualitative data to shed light on handgun access and use among those embedded in social networks where gun violence is common. The third paper examines the consequences of exposure to concentrated homicide within a social network of young men that have experienced the deaths of a large number of friends and peers. I close this dissertation by briefly discussing the overarching findings of these papers and their import for social theory and policy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The U.S. Department of Education's Ready To Learn (RTL) initiative funds (a) mass media and related community outreach intended to promote school readiness among all children especially at-risk populations, and (b) formative and summative research by third party evaluators (Michael Cohen Group, 2012). Today, the majority of American preschoolers have consumed RTL media, and RTL has become one of the largest funders of educational media research (Corporation for Public Broadcasting [CPB] & Public Broadcasting Service [PBS], 2011). This dissertation primarily aimed to assess RTL's short- and long-term effectiveness in promoting school readiness, specifically foundational literacy skills. As a secondary goal, this dissertation also sought to shed insight into methodological and theoretical issues concerning children's learning from media more broadly. Article 1 provides a meta-analytic review of the accumulated research on the short-term effectiveness of RTL's literacy-themed media. Results indicate that RTL media resulted in small but positive impacts on children's early literacy skills, comparable to comprehensive early childcare programs such as Head Start (Kay & Pennucci, 2014), but considerably smaller than targeted nonmediated literacy interventions, such as in-person phonics instruction (Langenberg et al., 2000). Article 2 outlines how a developmental researcher might re-recruit families who participated in research studies, such as early childhood RTL evaluations, for later research. It highlights newer technological tools that facilitate locating participants who moved between waves of data collection and scheduling them for follow-up sessions (e.g., people-centric search engines built on algorithms that scrape the Internet for publicly available contact information). Researchers conducting non-prospective longitudinal, prospective longitudinal, or even cross-sectional research could benefit from many of these strategies. Article 3 builds on Articles 1 and 2. Preschool and kindergarten students who participated in one of the evaluations included in the Article 1 meta-analysis were re-recruited for a follow-up study six years later, using recruitment strategies detailed in Article 2. Children were in preschool and kindergarten during the original intervention, and were in 5th and 6th grade at follow-up testing. Children completed age-appropriate literacy assessments, and their parents provided complementary survey data. Findings suggested the effects of early exposure to RTL media sustained into middle childhood, but only for children who had below and above average literacy skills in early childhood prior to the original intervention. These findings are interpreted in light of the Early Learning Hypothesis, and the Traveling Lens, Capacity, and Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Models. Altogether, these results provide relatively positive support in favor of the continued funding of RTL, and speak to larger theoretical debates concerning children's learning from media. Continued monitoring is warranted, as the specific foci and execution of the RTL initiative has evolved across grant cycles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: The At Home/Chez Soi (AH/CS) Project is a randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention to meet the needs of homeless individuals with mental illness in five cities across Canada. The objectives of this paper are to examine the approach to participant recruitment and community engagement at the Toronto site of the AH/CS Project, and to describe the baseline demographics of participants in Toronto. Methods: Homeless individuals (n = 575) with either high needs (n = 197) or moderate needs (n = 378) for mental health support were recruited through service providers in the city of Toronto. Participants were randomized to Housing First interventions or Treatment as Usual (control) groups. Housing First interventions were offered at two different mental health service delivery levels: Assertive Community Treatment for high needs participants and Intensive Case Management for moderate needs participants. Demographic data were collected via quantitative questionnaires at baseline interviews. Results: The effectiveness of the recruitment strategy was influenced by a carefully designed referral system, targeted recruitment of specific groups, and an extensive network of pre-existing services. Community members, potential participants, service providers, and other stakeholders were engaged through active outreach and information sessions. Challenges related to the need for different sectors to work together were resolved through team building strategies. Randomization produced similar demographic, mental health, cognitive and functional impairment characteristics in the intervention and control groups for both the high needs and moderate needs groups. The majority of participants were male (69%), aged >40 years (53%), single/never married (69%), without dependent children (71%), born in Canada (54%), and non-white (64%). Many participants had substance dependence (38%), psychotic disorder (37%), major depressive episode (36%), alcohol dependence (29%), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (23%), and mood disorder with psychotic features (21%). More than two-thirds of the participants (65%) indicated some level of suicidality. Conclusions: Recruitment at the Toronto site of AH/CS project produced a sample of participants that reflects the diverse demographics of the target population. This study will provide much needed data on how to best address the issue of homelessness and mental illness in Canada.

AB  - Objective and Participants: From 2002 to 2005, the authors tested an interactive, Web-based method to encourage college students at risk for suicide to seek treatment. Methods: The authors invited students at 2 universities to complete an online questionnaire that screened for depression and other suicide risk factors. Respondents received a personalized assessment and were able to communicate anonymously with a clinical counselor online. At-risk students were urged to attend in-person evaluation and treatment. Results: A total of 1,162 students (8% of those invited) completed the screening questionnaire; 981 (84.4%) were designated as at high or moderate risk. Among this group, 190 (19.4%) attended an in-person evaluation session with the counselor, and 132 (13.5%) entered treatment. Students who engaged in online dialogues with the counselor were 3 times more likely than were those who did not to come for evaluation and enter treatment. Conclusions: The method has considerable promise for encouraging previously untreated, at-risk college students to get help. (Contains 1 figure.)

AB  - A total of 4,375 subjects were recruited through continuous street outreach over 31 months for interviews on HIV-related risk behavior and HIV-antibody testing. Changes over time among sampled subjects with respect to HIV infection and HIV-risk behavior have been examined retrospectively, and significant and consistent trends noted across successive cohorts. Although overall 42% of the sample tested HIV antibody-positive, HIV infection exhibited a consistent downward trend from 60% in the first quarter year of interviewing to 22% in the final quarter year. Scores on a multivariate index of HIV risk also declined significantly. Mean age, proportion of Black subjects, mean length of drug injection career, frequency of drug injection, and the use of shooting galleries all declined significantly across quarters as well. We argue that these observed differences result from a systematic sampling bias inherent in our outreach-driven sampling procedures, which initially favored recruitment of IDUs with greater behavioral and demographic risk for HIV.

AB  - This article describes how implementation science and intervention research guided the process of selecting and implementing an evidence-informed intervention (Tuning in to Teens; TINT). TINT was provided as a selective prevention effort offered to families with youth aged 10 to 13 years old, with characteristics that suggest an elevated risk for post-permanency discontinuity. Usability testing findings: Contact was made with 54% of families, and 12% participated in the intervention. Multivariate results found no statistically significant differences between families who responded to outreach efforts and those who did not; families who participated in TINT and those who did not. Implications: Large public child welfare systems wanting to implement evidence-informed interventions can follow the steps detailed in this paper for selecting, adapting and implementing an intervention. Further, providers that seek to offer post adoption and guardianship services, a growing service need, may gain some insights into activities that promote service usage with this population.

Concentrating on the program's third year, this paper presents summative evaluations for seven Boys' Club pilot sites. Each summation concentrates on the site's ability to translate models developed over the first two years of the program into prototypes for incorporation into the ongoing Boys' Club program and examines the impact the intervention effort had on participants exposed to the program. Specific activities undertaken at each site to develop and/or implement the program are described. Sample data from surveys and interviews conducted by evaluators to assess the project's impact on participants are presented. Patterns of drinking behavior among the project's participants and a control group are compared. The impact of the entire three year project on the Boys' Club of America is analyzed and recommendations made by evaluators regarding the project are outlined. (EB)

AB  - Specialized programs for pregnant, drug dependent women have assisted many in achieving abstinence during pregnancy. Following delivery, however, such women often resume drug use and drop out of treatment, placing their children at even greater risk for subsequent medical and developmental problems. Standard outreach services, while generally effective as a public health measure for high-risk populations of women and children, are often insufficient for chronic and severely drug dependent women. The present study was a randomized clinical trial comparing maternal and infant outcomes for drug dependent women assigned to either routine or intensified case management services for the first 4 months following delivery. Women randomly assigned to intensified case management showed better treatment retention, accessed a greater variety of services, were more likely to be abstinent from cocaine at 4-month follow-up, and felt their children received greater benefit from the services than women assigned to routine case management. The number of case management visits was positively correlated with total time in treatment across both intervention groups. Study findings support the efficacy of intensified case management services for drug dependent women and their children.

AB  - Despite containing numerous wealthy geographic areas, the state of Connecticut continues to struggle with social and economic distress, along with gun-related crime. Problem analysis in urban areas revealed a critical need for services aimed at deterring violent and gun-related crime in two target populations: serious juvenile offenders, aged 14–17 years, and at-risk youth, aged 11–13 years. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) on youth in two cities in Connecticut. Implementation resulted in 133 young people receiving a variety of services in New Haven and Bridgeport. Evaluation research assessed intervention efforts designed to (1) build on the strengths and address the challenges of each juvenile offender, (2) expand community outreach and education efforts to reinforce and reward positive attitudes and behaviors surrounding 'no-gun policies,' and (3) utilize data-driven decision-making to guide program implementation and evaluate the results. Our findings suggest that youth who participated in Connecticut’s PSN Youth initiative benefited from the services provided and exhibited a decreased involvement in the juvenile justice system following enrollment.

AB  - This paper suggests that research has shown that street youth are running from homes characterized by domestic violence, parental drug and alcohol abuse, or child abuse or neglect. This packet describes federal support for helping runaway and homeless youth and reviews implementation of the "Street Outreach Program" and best practices. Resources are provided on the range of issues that the Street Outreach Program grantees and others must address in working with street youth. The information is covered: (1) "Publications Related to Preventing the Sexual Abuse or Exploitation of Street Youth"; (2) "Street Outreach Program Grantee List"; (3) "National Clearinghouses and Resource Centers Focusing on Issues Related to Working with Street Youth"; and (4) "National Resource Organizations Focusing on Issues Related to Working with Street Youth." This paper asserts that most young people can, with the support of caring adults, deal with their past and move toward independence and adulthood. (EMK)

AB  - This study describes a community outreach project designed to increase access to reproductive health services to young African American men living in low-income urban neighborhoods. The project examined the effectiveness of providing community-based outreach and health education on increasing sexually transmitted disease (STD) screening. Outreach workers provided STD education and risk assessment in community settings, including street corners, parks, schools, and community centers. Data were recorded on outreach contacts, including client demographics, health education topics covered, and risk assessment results. Outreach workers conducted 9,701 contacts in a 176-week period. Most contacts (89%) were with African Americans, and most (84%) were with young men between 15 and 20 years old. Outreach workers discussed each health education item in their protocol at least 85% of the time and each risk assessment item at least 90% of the time. The majority of contacts (94%) reported being sexually active. Compared with the year prior to the project, actual STD testing of the target population doubled at the project clinics. This study suggests that going beyond traditional clinic-based testing to reach young, disenfranchised males constitutes a promising approach to reducing racial disparities in STD infections.

AB  - Examined client characteristics, case management variables, and housing features associated with referral, entry, and short-term success in a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) national intensive case management and rental assistance program for homeless veterans with mental health problems. Information collected from homeless veterans at the time of initial outreach contact and from case managers during the housing search was used to create logistic regression models of referral into the program and successful completion of several stages in the process of obtaining stable independent housing. Overall, only 8% of the more than 65,000 eligible veterans contacted by outreach workers were referred to the program. Those referred were more likely to be female, to have more sources of income, to have recently used VA services (including residential treatment), and to have serious mental health problems. Once in the program, 64% of veterans eventually moved into an apartment, and 84% of those who obtained an apartment were stably housed 1 yr later. In general, activities of case managers, such as accompanying the veteran to the public housing authority and securing additional sources of income, were associated with success in the housing process.

AB  - Key attempts to stabilize a youth's life in the community through supervision and intensive counseling. The clients studied were involved in seven outreach and tracking programs and in two foster care programs. For different analyses, the sample was studied as a whole, by client difficulty in terms of prior criminal justice system involvement and by individual programs. Analyses included comparisons of offense frequency and seriousness, prediction of recidivism, reasons for client termination, termination results, and client stress. Of 85 clients with court involvement prior to the program, 49 percent reappeared in court in the 6 months following termination from Key, compared to 54 percent and 61 percent in studies of other programs. Clients who recidivated committed more serious and more frequent offenses than in the 6-month period before entering Key. However, Key reduced court contacts while youths participated in its programs. Only 22 percent of the variance in recidivism could be predicted from a combination of client background and program variables. Of 154 clients who terminated from the 9 programs, 34 percent were judged by counselors to be successful terminations, 41 percent to be unsuccessful terminations, and 25 percent to have terminated under neutral circumstances. Counselors felt that the group that was of middle difficulty showed the greatest mean improvement in relationships and behavior. Overall, the program was most successful with clients who had previous court involvement, primarily for property offenses, and who had extensive experience with other programs. Moreover, its influence over clients' recidivism decreased once a youth was terminated. Improved termination patterns and school support services are recommended. Tables, footnotes, a bibliography listing 23 references, and apendixes presenting offense severity rating and additional data are included.

AB  - Sought to develop and implement a community HIV-prevention program (called the Mpowerment Project) for young gay men. To assess the program's efficacy, the authors assessed pre- and post-intervention naturally occurring trends in sexual risk behavior and psychosexual variables in 18–27 yr old gay men in the 2 US communities in which the program was initiated. The Mpowerment program had 4 components: peer outreach, peer-led small groups, a publicity campaign, and a young men's center. Results suggest that mobilization of young gay men to support each other in safer sex is an effective approach to HIV prevention, but programs must be sustained and HIV prevention activities must be embedded into the satisfaction of needs for community and social belonging.

AB  - Educators are considering ways to help youth identified as "at-risk" succeed in school and beyond. Alternative programs (AP) can be effective environments for students who may not fit the mainstream mold and need additional support. Effective AP use a holistic approach that encompasses social, academic, psychological and career-related needs. The following eight factors consistently recur in research reports and descriptions of effective AP: (1) caring, knowledgeable adults; (2) a sense of community; (3) an assets approach; (4) respect for youth; (5) high expectations for academic achievement and responsible behavior; (6) holistic, comprehensive, multidimensional developmental curriculum; (7) authentic, engaging learning that connects school and work; and (8) support and long-term followup services. Some examples of AP include: career academies (small learning communities that engage students by focusing on career interests and rigorous academics that reflect high expectations); YouthBuild USA (program features include supportive peer-group communities, community service, culturally appropriate curricula, youth leadership, and follow-up through alumni clubs and support services such as information, counseling, and job placement); and Bridge over Troubled Waters (comprehensive programs and services include nontraditional outreach, runaway services, a preemployment program reflecting an assets approach, health education/peer counseling, parenting support, and a program for youth with developmental disabilities).

AB  - This article examines the feasibility of a complex intervention designed to facilitate the transition of youth out of homelessness. It is intended to contribute to efforts to build out the youth homelessness intervention literature, which is underdeveloped relative to descriptive characterizations of risk. The 6-month intervention examined here, referred to as the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C), is comprised of transitional outreach-based case management, individual and group mental health supports, and peer support. The intervention was delivered through a multiagency, interdisciplinary collaboration. Feasibility was assessed using a mixed methods design that included prepost intervention metrics and the study site was a large Canadian urban center. A total of 31 youth participated in the study with 28 completing the intervention. Overall, implementation and youth engagement was successful though patterns and intensity of engagement were quite variable. While prepost, self-report metrics improved modestly, substantial gains were observed in employment, education, and mental health service connectedness. Qualitative themes focused on the benefits of a flexible, multicomponent approach, close attention to seamless delivery and common factors, and supporting youth in the balance of isolation versus independence. These findings suggested that this tertiary prevention approach is feasible and warrants further investigation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - Little is known regarding the specific types of service models and collaborations that are necessary to support diverse populations of youth in transition out of homelessness. Transitional supports addressing the complex needs of this population are needed to stabilize the array of housing arrangements that youth access. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of one such critical time intervention, called the Housing Outreach Program-Collaboration (HOP-C). HOP-C is a multicomponent, multidisciplinary intervention that provides 6 months of mental health and peer support, along with transitional case management to youth who have transitioned into some form of stable housing out of homelessness. In this trial, 65 youth were randomized to receive HOP-C plus treatment as usual or transitional case management plus treatment as usual. Outcome assessments were completed by 30 treatment and 28 control participants. The findings suggest that this intervention is feasible with mental health, employment or education, and housing metrics favoring HOP-C with odds ratios ranging from 2.28 to 3.18 and better subjective housing stability. Other indicators showed less change. HOP-C appears feasible and should be tested in a fully powered trial, providing the intervention for a duration longer than 6 months. Overall, these data suggest the potential benefit in fostering city-level, multidisciplinary teams sourced from several organizations to support youth transitioning out of homelessness. Pragmatic trial method considerations for this population are also addressed as are the ethical considerations pertinent to engaging highly marginalized youth in clinical trials.

AB  - The Group Guidance Project applied standard detached-work procedures to four' large juvenile gang clusters containing approximately eight hundred youngsters over a four-year period. Project emphasis was on individual counseling and group programing. Research data revealed that the project was associated with a significant increase in gang delinquency, especially at the twelve- to fifteen-year age levels, and in high-companionship offenses. Analyses of inter-cluster differences and specific project events revealed positive relationships between levels of grout programing, cohesiveness, and delinquency. The conclusion is that a group-work approach to gang intervention may inadvertently defeat its own purpose, at least in the absence of an active development of alternatives to gang participation.

AB  - To understand the impact of high-poverty neighborhoods on families, we collected data from participants at the Boston site of HUD's Moving To Opportunity (MTO) demonstration. MTO randomly assigned housing vouchers to applicants living in high-poverty public housing projects. The vouchers allowed families to move to private apartments, typically in lower-poverty neighborhoods. This paper reports the results of our qualitative fieldwork which included observation of the operation of MTO in Boston and in-depth interviews with participants. This qualitative work had a profound impact on our MTO research. First, it caused us to refocus our quantitative data collection on a substantially different set of outcomes, primarily in the domains of safety and health. In our subsequent quantitative work, we found the largest program effects in the domains suggested by the qualitative interviews. Second, our qualitative work led us to develop an overall conceptual framework for thinking about the impacts of high-poverty neighborhoods on families and the ways in which moves to lower poverty neighborhoods might affect these families. We observed that fear of random violence appears to cause parents in ghetto families to focus a substantial portion of their daily routine on keeping their children safe. In later quantitative research, we confirmed that parental monitoring intensity was reduced among families offered housing vouchers. We further hypothesized that the need to live life on the watch may have broad implications for the future prospects of these families--including potential impacts on children's development and on the mothers' ability to engage in activities that would lead them to become economically self-sufficient, although sufficient data to assess this hypothesis are not yet available. Third, our fieldwork gave us a deeper understanding of the institutional details of the MTO program. This understanding has helped us to make judgements concerning the external validity of our MTO findings, and has prevented us from making some significant errors in interpreting our quantitative results. Fourth, by listening to MTO families talk about their lives, we learned a series of lessons that have important implications for housing policy. For many of the things we learned, it is hard to imagine any other data collection strategy that would have led us to these insights.

AB  - Adolescent antisocial behaviour and mental health issues are pressing social concerns. Adolescents who reside in disadvantaged inner-city neighbourhoods have diverse vulnerabilities and needs that may often go unmet due to a lack of available and accessible community services. Community outreach represents a promising approach to engaging with at-risk adolescents and connecting them to the necessary community services. The lack of program evaluations, however, has limited researchers in the development of an evidence base for effective outreach training programs, and highlights the gap between best practices for youth outreach and the research and theoretical foundations that could inform practices. The purpose of the present study was to assess the needs of the Toronto Youth Outreach Worker (YOW) Program and then to develop, implement, evaluate, and sustain the training developed in this project. My objectives were to increase YOWs' capacity for case management and data collection, and to apply a more cogent theoretical framework to YOW program activities. I collaborated with community practitioners to develop the YOW Stages of Change Training and accompanying reporting protocol (Youth Face Sheet) informed by the Stages of Change and Encounter theories, as well as the positive youth development perspective. YOWs and supervisors tested the new reporting protocol for three months following the Stages of Change Training. At the end of the data-collection period, I analyzed data collected using the reporting protocol and interviewed YOWs and supervisors regarding the usefulness of the theories, training, and reporting protocol. The quantitative research question addressed whether the Youth Face Sheet adequately captured the basic demographics of the sample, the services provided by the program, and the intensity of the intervention. The Youth Face Sheet demonstrated that, according to YOWs' perceptions, YOWs matched their encounter stage with youths' readiness for change and supported progress through the stages of change in a range of health-related behaviours. Qualitative research questions addressed whether the theoretical structure underlying the training and protocol was useful for tracking outreach and guiding supervision. YOWs reported that the underlying theories of the Stages of Change Training increased their ability to assess youth, and to provide strength-based support, which included clear, well-articulated goals and on-going follow-up. By promoting a common dialogue to qualify and quantify outreach, the new reporting protocol provided structure and enhanced the consistency of supervision provided to workers. This study contributed to the evidence base regarding effective approaches for training outreach workers and for quantifying program activities. Based on this collaborative research regarding the Stages of Change Training, the Toronto Youth Outreach Worker Program has made significant steps toward developing and sustaining uniform guidelines for professional conduct among outreach workers and supervisors.

AB  - Background: One of the main priorities of Dutch organisations providing shelter services is to develop evidence-based interventions in the care for abused women and homeless people. To date, most of these organisations have not used specific intervention models and the interventions which have been implemented rarely have an empirical and theoretical foundation. The present studies aim to examine the effectiveness of critical time intervention (CTI) for abused women and homeless people. Methods: In two multi-centre randomised controlled trials we investigate whether CTI, a time-limited (nine month) outreach intervention, is more effective than care-as-usual for abused women and homeless people making the transition from shelter facilities to supported or independent housing. Participants were recruited in 19 women's shelter facilities and 22 homeless shelter facilities across The Netherlands and randomly allocated to the intervention group (CTI) or the control group (care-as-usual). They were interviewed four times in nine months: once before leaving the shelter, and then at three, six and nine months after leaving the shelter. Quality of life (primary outcome for abused women) and recurrent loss of housing (primary outcome for homeless people) as well as secondary outcomes (e.g. care needs, self-esteem, loneliness, social support, substance use, psychological distress and service use) were assessed during the interviews. In addition, the model integrity of CTI was investigated during the data collection period. Discussion: Based on international research CTI is expected to be an appropriate intervention for clients making the transition from institutional to community living. If CTI proves to be effective for abused women and homeless people, shelter services could include this case management model in their professional standards and improve the (quality of) services for clients.

AB  - Examined data on case management clients who are homeless and have a severe mental illness to determine how those contacted through street outreach differ in their socio-demographic characteristics, service needs, and outcomes from those clients contacted in shelters and other health and social service agencies. As part of the Center for Mental Health Services' Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports program, data were obtained from potential clients over the 1st 3 yrs of the program at the time of the 1st outreach contact (N = 11,857), at the time of enrollment in the case management program (N = 5,431), and 3 mo after enrollment (N = 4,587). Clients contacted at outreach on the street, as opposed to being contacted in shelters and service agencies, were generally worse off. They expressed less interest in treatment and were less likely to enroll in the case management phase of the project. Ss contacted on the street who did enroll were more impaired than their street counterparts who did not enroll. Three mo outcome data showed that enrolled clients contacted through street outreach showed improvement that was equivalent to those enrolled clients contacted in shelters and other service agencies on nearly all outcome measures.

AB  - This chapter describes a therapeutic outreach program in Canada's arctic region and the personal history of its founder. Currently, we have completed intensive 1-week programs in 38 remote communities in Canada and have been described by government officials as the most important outreach that has ever happened in Canada's North. We become the replacement school curriculum for 100 teenage youth in these communities. (Many of them don't attend school but regularly join in with us when we come to town.) From 9 to 5 each day for 5 days, it feels like Hip-Hop boot camp. The secret to our success, I believe, lies in the use of many different techniques of engagement and is based on the strength of the relationships that form between my team and the youth we work with. We bring with us some of Canada's top street dancers. Our team reflects a modern and complex vision of Hip-Hop: men and women. Black, White, Asian, First Nation, Inuit, Spanish. More importantly we are all true passionate Hip-Hop heads who bring our honesty about who we are to the youth as an open book. We often bring our own personal stories of abuse, depression, rape, anger, suicide, and so on, directly to the table. The youth are smart; they look directly into our eyes and size us up. There is no faking the funk. If you bring the realness about who you are as a person first and humble yourself before their culture, the door starts to open into their own lives. We see ourselves as passionate human beings that believe in bettering ourselves and our art day by day, and celebrating each other's presence along the way. We offer ourselves as possible new role models to consider for this complex world. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Accessible summary What is known on the subject? Outreach services are often successful in engaging and housing street homeless individuals., People experiencing homelessness have greatly increased rates of mental illness and substance abuse., What this paper adds to existing knowledge? Given the relative lack of research involving street homeless individuals, this ret-rospective chart review examined factors associated with successful housing by a multidisciplinary street outreach team, including the use of hospitalization as an intervention within a housing first framework., The majority of clients were successfully housed by the end of outreach team involvement., An admission to hospital was strongly associated with successful housing for those with a psychotic disorder., What are the implications for practice? Multidisciplinary outreach teams, specifically those with psychiatric and nursing support, successfully work with and house people experiencing street homeless-ness and psychosis., Mental health nurses embedded in the community are an essential link between inpatient and outpatient care for highly vulnerable street homeless individuals., Abstract Introduction Housing-first strategies have helped establish housing as a human right. However, endemic homelessness persists. Multidisciplinary outreach teams that include nursing, social and psychiatric services allow for integrative strategies to engage and support clients on their housing trajectory. The following retrospective review focused on the identification of demographic, clinical, and service characteristics that predicted the obtainment of housing, and explored the role of psychiatric hospitalization as an intervention, not an outcome measure, in contrast to previous studies. These have rarely focused on street homelessness. Method A retrospective chart review of 85 homeless, primarily rough-sleeping, clients was conducted to determine housing outcomes and the factors associated with obtaining housing through care provided by a psychiatric street outreach team in Toronto, Canada. Demographics, homelessness duration, diagnosis, hospitalization and housing status were tracked during team involvement. Results Overall, 46% (36/79) were housed during the study term. Securing housing at the end of treatment/data collection was significantly enhanced by hospitalization (OR = 9.04, 95% CI [2.43, 33.59]). It was significantly diminished by psychosis (OR = 0.22, 95% CI [0.05, 0.95]) and prior homelessness >36 months (OR = 0.10, 95% CI [0.02, 0.50]). Twenty-three of 31 (74%) hospitalized clients with psychosis were subsequently housed, compared to 4 of 30 (13%) not hospitalized (Fisher's exact, P < .001). Discussion Multidisciplinary street outreach teams successfully house long-standing homeless clients (>12 months without a permanent address) with serious mental illness and/or substance abuse. Hospitalization can be utilized as a complimentary intervention, particularly for those with psychosis, in the continuum of housing first initiatives, and can contribute to securing housing for those with persistent psychotic disorders. Implications for nursing practice Community mental health nurses are uniquely positioned to translate care between hospital and community settings, ensuring timely assessment, intervention and treatment of clients who are historically difficult to engage.

AB  - Objective: We assess the impact of a community-based intervention program for boys 6-11 years old at-risk of antisocial behaviour, and compare changes in behaviour and competence pre-post for intervention and wait-list comparison group. Method: Interested parents called for enrolment. Inclusion required police contact and/or clinical scores (T > 69) on Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) or Teacher Report Form (TRF), no developmental delay and English speaking. The program included two core 12-week groups (children's, parents') and optional additional services. Twelve sessions (February 2002 - December 2005) provide pre-post intervention data, boys waiting at least 6 months formed a comparison group (starting April 2005). Outcomes included CBCL and TRF behaviour scales (rule-breaking, aggression, conduct, total problems) and competence. Repeated measures analysis of variance was done. Results: Pre-post outcome comparisons indicated improvements among all boys, with significant differences favouring intervention boys on CBCL behaviour scales, but not TRF outcomes. Effect sizes were small to medium. Persisting high post- behaviour levels, unmeasured variation in additional services, and other design and sampling issues are noted. Conclusions: More rigorously designed program evaluation is required. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Purpose-Youth violence victimisation impacts on health, mental health and future risk trajectories. A London hospital emergency department (ED) outreach youth service provides a unique intervention opportunity to support adolescents involved in violence. The purpose of this paper is to describe the set-up of the service. Design/methodology/approach-Young people (YP) targeted were aged 12-18, from two London boroughs and attended ED with injuries from a violent incident. They were referred to Oasis youth workers for a mentoring/youth work intervention. Lifestyle and symptom scales were used to assess risk profile. Hospital staff questionnaires determined service awareness in the first six months, and interviews/focus group identified potential barriers to service uptake. Findings-By 12 months, the service was operating smoothly. Of the first 505 YP attending ED, a third were referred, a third ineligible and a third non-contactable/refused. Detailed analysis of the first 30 attending found most were male (87 per cent), equal White or Black ethnicity (40 per cent) with 20 per cent 'Other' ethnicities, with only a third living with both biological parents. This was similar to the full population attending. Nearly half (49 per cent) had been assaulted, 30 per cent had injuries self-generated through poor anger management, the remainder injured in fighting. Over half (57 per cent) had disorder, mostly behavioural, correlated with lifestyle risk scores. Barriers to service use/implementation included YP mistrust and fear of reprisals, problems with service visibility in the busy hospital environment and ineffective staff communication with YP, all countered during the running of the service. Gauging outcome at follow-up is the second evaluation stage. Originality/value-The youth violence project is an important initiative for intervention in youth violence.

AB  - As a response to homelessness and its relationship with mental health problems, Queensland established homeless health outreach teams. These teams were designed to provide assertive outreach to homeless people by specialist mental health practitioners. The aim of this research was to determine to what extent these teams operate within an established framework for effective assertive outreach. A secondary aim was to determine the validity of an existing fidelity measure in evaluation of homeless outreach services. The Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale (DACTS) was administered to the five Queensland Homeless Health Outreach Teams (HHOT). It was found that the teams operated in the middle range on the fidelity measure with higher fidelity in human services and services than in organizational boundaries. Overall, the larger, more metropolitan teams appeared to achieve higher fidelity than the smaller more rural teams. Low fidelity scores can, in part, be attributed to weak validity of some DACTS items in relation to homeless outreach services as provided by Queensland HHOT services and recommendations are made for revision of the instrument to make it more suitable for use with these teams.

AB  - The California Prevention Education Program (CAL-PEP) does street outreach to people at high risk of HIV infection in San Francisco and primarily the East Bay, bringing services directly to clients where they congregate and engage in high-risk behavior. To find clients, outreach workers go to street corners and alleys, abandoned buildings, crack houses, shooting galleries, check cashing centers, soup kitchens, homeless camps, and single occupancy hotels. For a 'front-line' prevention organization such as CAL-PEP, two questions are of utmost importance. First: how effective are their services? Second: can their work be improved? The absence of rigorous evaluation has been a barrier to stable funding, preventing the CAL-PEP outreach model from getting wider attention. This chapter attempts to answer these questions.

AB  - During the 1984-1985 school year, a pilot dropout outreach program was instituted by the Los Angeles (California) Unified School District's Division of Adult and Occupational Education in cooperation with the senior high schools division. Dropouts from the 1983-1984 school year were identified and were sent personal letters inviting them to return to the local community adult school, regional occupational center, or skills center to earn a high school diploma or to obtain job training. The initial mailing included a personal letter in English and Spanish, a brochure, and a postcard. Press conferences were held to coincide with each mailing, and separate follow-up mailings were sent to those who returned the postcard and to those who did not respond to the first mailing. Special counseling assistance was provided for students who responded to the mailings including discussion of opportunities for open enrollment, individualized competency-based learning programs, and flexible scheduling. Of 1,256 individuals to whom the initial mailing was sent, 215 (about 20 percent) responded positively to the invitation to return to school. The cost of the effort (not counting the time of regular division personnel) was $17.50 per student for recruitment and $100 per student for recovery. (Appendixes, comprising more than half the document, include samples of the letters, brochures, and postcards sent in the initial and follow-up mailings and examples of newspaper coverage of the project.)

AB  - There is limited evidence available on the health-seeking behaviours of individuals in relation to determinants of healthcare use. This study aimed to analyse the determinants of healthcare use (including both hospital and outpatient services) among homeless people with severe mental health illnesses. The study used data from a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial conducted in four large French cities (the French Housing First Study). Data were drawn from 671 homeless people enrolled in the study between August 2011 and April 2014. Mobile mental health outreach teams recruited homeless individuals with severe mental health illnesses who were living on the street or in emergency shelters, hospitals or prisons. Data collection was performed during face-to-face interviews. Healthcare service use included hospitalisations, mental health and regular emergency department (ED) visits and outpatient visits to healthcare facilities or physicians' offices over a 6-month follow-up period. The data were analysed with zero-inflated (ZI) two-part models. In total, 61.1% of participants had at least one hospitalisation stay over the previous 6 months, with a mean of 25 (+/− 39.2) hospital days, and the majority (51%) had visited the ED (either for regular or mental health issues) during the same time period. The results confirmed the role of financial barriers (resources and health insurance) in seeking hospital care (P < 0.05). The main predictors for hospital use in the study population were a better social functioning score (odds ratio [OR]: 1.03; P < 0.001) and having schizophrenia (OR: 1.39; P < 0.01). Higher mental health scores (assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey) (OR: 1.03, P < 0.01) and alcohol dependence (OR: 2.13; P < 0.01) were associated with not using ED healthcare services. Being 'absolutely homeless' predicted an increased use of the ED and a zero use of outpatient services. Inversely, no association with factors related to the homelessness trajectory was found in hospital ZI negative binomial models. This study is important because a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of healthcare use enables healthcare systems to adapt and develop. The efficiency of medicosocial interventions targeting the homeless population with mental health illnesses must also be assessed. NCT01570712. • There is limited evidence on outpatient health-seeking behaviours of homeless people. • Schizophrenia and homelessness trajectory are predictors for non-use of outpatient care. • Social functioning, alcohol dependence and mental health symptoms are predictors of inpatient care use. • The identified predictors should be targeted to improve the care pathway for homeless people with mental health needs.

AB  - Aim This study presents client characteristics and treatment outcomes for a group of young people seen by Central Norfolk Early Intervention Team ( CNEIT). The team offers an intensive outreach model of treatment to young people with complex co-morbid emotional, behavioural and social problems, as well as the presence of psychotic symptoms. Methods Outcomes include both client self-report and clinician-rated measures. Data are routinely collected at acceptance into service, after 12 months of service and at point of discharge. Results Data show that clients seen by the CNEIT youth team are a group of young people at high risk of developing long-term mental illness and social disability. Outcomes show significant reductions in not only psychotic symptomatology, but also co-morbid anxiety and depression, as well as improvements in social recovery. At the end of their time with the service, the majority of clients are discharged back to the care of their general practitioner, which indicates that the team successfully managed to reduce the complexity of needs and difficulties associated with this client group. Conclusions Outcomes support the use of an intensive outreach approach for young people at high risk of developing psychotic disorders. It has been suggested that this model may be successfully broadened to young people with other emerging, potentially severe or complex mental disorders. Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust has built on the success of its youth early intervention team and innovatively redesigned its services in line with this model by developing a specific youth mental health service.

AB  - This ex post facto study evaluated Achieving a College Education (ACE) Plus program, a credit-based transition program between a high school district and a community college. Achieving a College Education Plus is an early outreach program. It is designed to aid at-risk students in graduating from high school and making a smooth transition to higher education, while taking college courses and earning college credit. The authors examined the efficacy of Achieving a College Education Plus with respect to retention rates, graduation rates, and rate of transfer to colleges. Sixty high school students who had participated in Achieving a College Education Plus were matched to a sample of 60 non-Achieving a College Education Plus students. Archival records, postgraduate survey, and school district transcript information comprised three sources of data for this study. Using a series of logistic regression analyses to assess data and provide adequate controls for prior academic achievement, the authors determined that there were no differences in the findings with respect to gender, ethnicity, and language spoken in the home. However, statistically significant differences were found in favor of the Achieving a College Education Plus program with regard to student retention, graduation, and college enrollment. With an increasing emphasis on college readiness and student retention, this study is timely and contributes empirical data and findings to the community college literature. (Contains 4 tables.)

The author discusses 3 developmental categories that form a continuum running from high-risk status to living on the street. The problems of street children, including physical violence and drug abuse, are illustrated through the cases of 2 young boys (aged 13 and 15 yrs). Programs for working with street children are based on correctional, rehabilitative, outreach, and preventive approaches. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: This study assessed the effects of a community outreach and education model implemented as part of the Early Detection, Intervention and Prevention of Psychosis Program(EDIPPP), a national multisite study in six U.S. regions. Methods: EDIPPP’s model was designed to generate rapid referrals of youths at clinical high risk of psychosis by creating a network of professionals and community members trained to identify signs of early psychosis. Qualitative and quantitative data were gathered through an evaluation of outreach efforts at five sites over a two-year period and through interviews with staff at all six sites. All outreach activities to groups (educational, medical, and mental health professionals; community groups; media; youth and parent groups; and multicultural communities) were counted for the six sites to determine correlations with total referrals and enrollments. Results: During the study period (May 2007–May 2010), 848 formal presentations were made to 22,840 attendees and 145 informal presentations were made to 11,528 attendees at all six sites. These presentations led to 1,652 phone referrals. A total of 520 (31%) of these individuals were offered in person orientation, and 392 (75%) of those were assessed for eligibility. A total of 337 individuals (86% of those assessed) met criteria for assignment to the EDIPPP study. Conclusions: EDIPPP’s outreach and education model demonstrated the effectiveness of following a protocol-defined outreach strategy combined with flexibility to reach culturally diverse audiences or initially inaccessible systems. All EDIPPP sites yielded appropriate referrals of youths at risk of psychosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many programs which focus on reducing adolescent suicide offer traditional mental health services and neglect to include an evaluation component. Therefore, it is unclear as to what aspects of a prevention program actually reduce the incidence of adolescent suicide. A community-based outreach program was selected for evaluation, because of its heavy focus on psychological autopsy research in the development of the program and because of its non-traditional approach to treatment. Interviews with staff members focused on the development of the program, job descriptions, perceived effectiveness of the program, and gaps between how the program appears on paper and how the program exists in reality. A client summary form was developed in order to analyze demographic information of the teens against measures of goal achievement and program effectiveness. A discriminant analysis showed that 67% of the teenagers achieved at least one goal and they were considered to have successfully completed the program. Results showed different patterns of at-risk factors where males were more likely to have problems with the police while females were more likely to have problems with drugs or alcohol. The staff interviews revealed that no formal needs assessment was ever performed, and there is no effective outcome measure being used. However, the program was very effective at engaging teenagers who dropout of traditional mental health services. This program might embody those factors that effectively reduce the incidence of teenage suicide, therefore a more formal measure of outcome is suggested.

AB  - Substance use disorders and related conditions play significant roles in urban homelessness and its personal and social costs. Traditional addiction treatment programs have failed to attract, engage, retain, and effectively treat this population, leaving homeless persons excluded from addiction treatment or constituting a chronically recycling segment of the treatment population. This article describes the design and outcomes of the Journey of Hope Project—a special homeless initiative that was part of a broader 'recovery-focused systems transformation process' in the city of Philadelphia. New approaches to outreach, treatment, and continuing recovery management demonstrated the ability to recruit, retain, and enhance long-term recovery outcomes for individuals with histories of severe substance use and related disorders and chronic homelessness. The service designs described and the service outcomes reported underscore the need to radically alter traditional service models to achieve enhanced long-term recovery outcomes with this population.

AB  - This report describes the rationale, implementation, and efficacy evaluation of a brief, motivational intervention for young users of cocaine, crack cocaine, and ecstasy not in contact with treatment services. The intervention was developed so it could be used by peer and other drug workers. The evaluation was a two-condition, multi-site, randomized controlled trial with a single 6-month follow-up. Participants were 16-22 years old. They identified themselves to be primary users of cocaine hydrochloride, crack cocaine, or ecstasy and were subsequently assigned to these primary stimulant groups for analysis. No participant had been in treatment during the previous 12 months and none had a treatment history for opiate dependence or injecting. Trial participants were recruited in 11 sites in Greater London and Kent using detached outreach, specific advertising campaigns, and by participant-driven snowball-sampling methods. Six-month follow-up interviews were successfully conducted with 299 participants. The participant recruitment methodology used in the trial was successful, showing that longitudinal, experimental studies with young out-of-treatment drug users are quite feasible. There were a range of positive changes reported by participants in both the experimental and control conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Home‐Based Mental Health Evaluation (HOME) program, which engages veterans in care following psychiatric hospitalization, was evaluated. Thirty‐four veterans who participated in the HOME program were compared to 34 veterans from a matched archival control group on treatment engagement and implementation outcomes. Veterans who participated in the HOME program were significantly more likely to engage in care, engaged in care more quickly, and attended significantly more individual mental health appointments. Veterans reported high levels of satisfaction. Results suggest that the HOME program is effective at engaging veterans in care during the high‐risk period of time following psychiatric hospitalization.

AB  - This study conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of Delaware’s CREST Outreach Center, a work release therapeutic community (TC) and aftercare program for criminal offenders. Treatment effectiveness was assessed using the number of days reincarcerated during an 18-month, post-release follow-up period. The 6-month CREST program cost $1937 for the average participant, and led to ∼30 fewer days incarcerated (29% less) than the average participant in a standard work release program. This implies that the CREST program reduced incarceration for criminal offenders at an average cost of $65 per day. The additional investment of $935 per client to provide aftercare services led to 49 fewer days incarcerated (43% less) than CREST work release-only participants. This suggests that by adding an aftercare component to the CREST work release program, a day of incarceration is avoided at an average cost of $19 per day. These findings have implications for future investments in post-release substance abuse treatment for criminal offenders. However, the results must be interpreted with caution given potential selection bias in the groups that participated in the CREST work release and aftercare programs. Selection bias and the policy implications of this research are noted and discussed.

AB  - In a study to determine the effectiveness of HIV interventions in changing risk behaviors, a population of 185 African-American male crack cocaine users was randomized into 2 arms of an experimental design. 83 Ss received a standard intervention, designed by the National Institute of Drug Abuse and a committee of grantees, and 102 Ss received a locally designed innovative intervention. Baseline and follow-up measures were compared for both groups, indicating significant behavioral changes for each of the 2 groups. Significant differences were noted between the standard and innovative interventions for a specific subgroup. This study suggests the increasing need to develop, implement and evaluate intervention models targeted to specific subgroups and specific behaviors in order to find the most appropriate and cost-effective prevention models.

AB  - The decade of the 1990s witnessed unexpected but welcome large declines in homicide and serious firearms violence. Yet, despite these declines, rates of firearms crime in the United States remain high compared to other western democracies and impose significant costs to society generally and to specific communities particularly. One promising approach to gun crime emerged in Boston during the mid‐1990s. This approach combined face‐to‐face communication of a deterrence message to youth gang members with social service outreach and crackdowns on several gangs. Boston then experienced very significant declines in youth gun crime. This approach was later repeated in Minneapolis with similar promising results. This paper presents the results of a study of a similar gun‐crime‐reduction effort in Indianapolis. Time‐series analyses suggest a significant decline in homicide similar to those observed in Boston and Minneapolis. Comparisons to six similar Midwestern cities revealed that Indianapolis was the only city to experience a significant decline in homicide. The results are discussed in the context of deterrence research and suggest the need to move beyond single‐city evaluations of promising interventions.

AB  - Aims: To explore the impact of a targeted case identification intervention, with training and education regarding first‐episode psychosis and clinical high‐risk syndromes, on the referral and identification of those at high risk. Methods: Using a historical control design, referral information from pre‐intervention and post‐intervention periods was collected via administrative data and clinician notes from a catchment‐based early psychosis service. Results: A significant increase in the number of referrals sent to the service's clinical high‐risk unit was observed following the intervention (P = 0.01). The proportion of referrals eligible was significantly higher post‐intervention (P = 0.03), with the majority (26/44, 59.1%) referred via the first‐episode psychosis service unit. Conclusions: An integrated outreach intervention for both first‐episode psychosis and the clinical high‐risk state was effective in increasing referrals of eligible cases to the service's at‐risk unit. Rather than being stage‐specific, targeted case identification strategies and service integration should span across the early stages of psychosis.

AB  - This report examines the 1988-1989 Attendance Improvement Dropout Prevention (AIDP) program as it operated in 30 New York City public high schools under new guidelines and broadened student eligibility criteria. Part I introduces the dropout prevention program, lists program guidelines and objectives, and describes the evaluation methodology. Part II focuses on program implementation, noting that all participating schools implemented attendance incentives and parent outreach, individual and group counseling, and P.M. schools; and that 70 to 80% implemented 9th and 10th grade houses, block programming, part-time jobs, work-study, vocational training, and independent study. Part III presents student outcomes and part IV gives conclusions and recommendations. A review of the data revealed that all five of the identified program objectives were met in more than 50% of participating schools: (1) 63% of schools met the average daily attendance objective in 9th grades and 53% met that objective in 10th grades; (2) 94% met semester attendance objective in 9th grades and 100% met that objective in 10th grades; (3) 50% reduced their percentage of long-term absentees in 9th grades and 63% met this objective in 10th grades; (4) the 9th graders in 23% of the schools and 10th graders in 97% of schools met the credit accumulation objective; and (5) 67% of schools reduced their dropout rates by the requisite amount. A list of variables used to measure each objective and a list of participating AIDP schools are appended. (NB)

AB  - Among youth 15 to 24 years of age, homicide and nonfatal shootings are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Urban youth's attitudes and perceptions about the use of gun violence to resolve conflict present a major barrier to efforts to reduce gun homicides and nonfatal shootings. The current investigation extends the existing literature on attitudes toward guns and shootings among high-risk youth ages 18 to 24 by measuring perceived norms and viewpoints regarding gun violence in two analogous Baltimore City neighborhoods pre-implementation and 1-year post-implementation of the Safe Streets intervention (adapted from the CeaseFire/Cure Violence intervention). The Safe Streets intervention is designed for communities with high rates of gun violence and utilizes outreach workers to identify and build trusting relationships with youth ages 15 to 24 who are at greatest risk of being involved in gun violence. The outreach workers also position themselves in the community so that they can rapidly intervene in disputes that have the potential to lead to gun violence. Chi-squared tests and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were used to examine changes in attitudes toward gun violence 1 year after the implementation of the Safe Streets intervention. There was a statistically significantly improvement in 43 % of the attitudes assessed in the intervention community post-intervention compared to 13 % of the attitudes in the control community. There was a statistically significant improvement in the violent attitudes toward personal conflict resolution scale after implementation of the intervention in both the intervention (b = -0.522, p < 0.001) and control community (b = -0.204, p < 0.032). Exposure to the intervention (e.g., seeing stop shooting signs in your neighborhood) was also associated with the nonviolent attitudes toward conflict scale. Overall, the study found greater improvement in attitudes toward violence in the intervention community following the implementation of the Safe Streets program. These findings offer promising insights into future community violence prevention efforts.

AB  - This report evaluates the special education component of the 1986-87 Attendance Improvement/Dropout Prevention program of the New York City Board of Education. The program was designed to provide intensive services to special education students at risk of dropping out of school. The report presents characteristics of students in the program, examines the degree to which the program guidelines were implemented, analyzes attendance and academic improvement of student participants, and presents conclusions and recommendations. Students selected for the program had excessive absence, low reading level, health problems, or behavior problems. Program services for the 2,333 students in 43 middle schools and citywide sites included a facilitation component to monitor attendance and provide referrals to community agencies; an attendance outreach component to contact parents concerning their children's progress; a guidance/counseling component; a health component; a school linkages component to provide high-school orientations; and an alternative education component to provide work/study experiences, jobs, and life skills training. Staffing consisted of guidance counselors, social workers, teacher trainers, and family workers. Overall, 38 percent of the students improved their attendance; 57 percent of students who failed at least one subject in the previous year showed improvement the following year. (JDD)

AB  - Child abuse and neglect is a serious public health problem, whose prevention efforts are much needed to avoid a number of serious and irrevocable negative consequences. Currently, the majority of early prevention approaches are community based with fairly strict eligibility criteria. Public child welfare system has yet to settle on a clear paradigm for early prevention. As many states are considering extending their services to reports screened out of Child Protective Services (CPS), there is a need to better understand the utilization and effectiveness of such early preventative services. Additionally, changing American cultural landscape has presented challenges to the field in how to best address family needs and child safety of the foreign-born population. Parent Support Outreach Program (PSOP) is an early CPS response and service model to screened-out reports using Differential Response (DR) philosophy to identify family needs and strengths and provide them with services addressing those needs. Mixed methods design included a quasi-experiment using propensity score methods to compare families' risk, services, and outcomes in PSOP (n=1,964) and standard DR (n=1,793) programs and between US-born (n=2,755) and foreign-born (n=1,002) population. In addition, qualitative interviews with program workers (n=15) were collected to examine workers' perceptions about program and population differences. The quantitative data included longitudinal administrative child welfare service, unemployment insurance, and income maintenance as well as cross-sectional worker survey and the U.S. Census data. Subsequent screened-in and screened-out maltreatment reports, out of home placement, mental health and substance abuse services as well as economic well-being were the primary outcomes of interest. Compared to a standard DR program, PSOP served families had a higher or equal number of risk factors across most family functioning domains, except for substance abuse, problematic parenting, and prior CPS history. Face-to-face and other contacts with program workers were greater for PSOP than DR families involved in the assessment stage while DR provided more contacts for families receiving case management services. Poverty-related services were the most frequently received services by PSOP families. PSOP families experienced significantly fewer screened-in and screened-out CPS reports and out of home placements and received more adult mental health services than DR families. Null effects were found for the receipt of children's mental health and adult substance abuse services as well as economic well-being outcomes. Programmatic effects varied by population socio-demographic subgroups while service factors moderated the relationship between risks and outcomes. There were significant differences in risks, services, and outcomes across racial, ethnic, and national groups. There is a great need for child welfare services to focus not only on child safety but also on risk factors observed for the family. By targeting risks prospectively and focusing on child well-being broadly, maltreatment prevention would take a much needed proactive focus in the child welfare policy. Strong support for PSOP effectiveness found in this study should inform other states' efforts in extending services to the screened-out families. High number of risk factors and comprised well-being over time among the foreign-born population call for their active inclusion in the child welfare prevention programs, best administered through community partners.

AB  - Child abuse and neglect is a major public health problem. Early efforts to prevent maltreatment are much needed to avoid a number of serious and irrevocable negative consequences for children. Currently, most early prevention approaches utilize a variety of community based services while the public Child Protective Services (CPS) system has yet to settle on a clear paradigm for prevention. Accordingly, there is a need to better understand the potential of such services within the CPS. This study sought to determine whether the Parent Support Outreach (PSO) program, an early CPS response and service model to screened-out reports and other high-risk families in Minnesota's child welfare system, resulted in less subsequent CPS involvement, increased use of mental health and substance abuse services, and improvement of family's economic well-being. The study also examined whether these outcomes varied across population subgroups. Employing a quasi-experimental design with propensity score methods and using multiple administrative data sources, the study found that the PSO group experienced significantly fewer CPS reports and out of home placements and was more likely to receive adult mental health services than similar families in the Differential Response program. Additionally, there were a number of significant subgroup effects across multiple outcomes. Support for the PSO program offers new opportunities to jurisdictions considering offering early prevention services to families in need. • PSO group experienced significantly fewer CPS reports and out of home placements than the DR group • PSO group was more likely to receive adult mental health services than the DR group • Subgroup effects were observed for foreign-born, prior CPS history, households with a male presence, and geography.

AB  - The National Service Framework for Mental Health (NSF) (1999) and the National Plan (2000) have stimulated a sea change in mental health care. The challenge for services is how to deliver the changes effectively to address local needs, diversity and resources. This project contributes by presenting three linked but discrete papers prepared for publication. They derive from research studies within which the author took a principal role. The first paper analyses the needs, packages of care and clinical outcomes for people in touch with mental health services in three areas of England. It asked, what can we learn about whether, and how effectively, services match need, indifferent service and socio-demographic environments? The second paper describes the implementation of two voluntary sector Assertive Outreach teams, their adherence to the Assertive Community Treatment model and outcomes for their users. It asked, how effective are voluntary sector-based Assertive Outreach teams at engaging appropriate clients and improving their clinical and social outcomes? The third paper examines the experiences and pathways through care for young black men with severe mental illness. It asked what are the key issues affecting their pathways through care and can training GP practices improve the situation? Taken together, three key findings emerged: 1. People with severe mental health problems receive greater than average support from modern mental health systems. However, more care for people with greater need will be more expensive if this consists mainly of inpatient care rather than alternative enhanced community based services. 2. Positive outcomes can be, and are, achieved, even for those with the most severe needs. However, services are not standardised and care pathways to and through them are not always clear, appropriate or smooth. Not adhering to clear, evidence-based models may compromise services' effectiveness. 3. Some vulnerable people still miss out on positive care, especially those who cannot, or will not, willingly engage with services. People with frequent admissions to hospital, homeless people, people with a dual diagnosis and young black men may not have equal access to the services they need, even when services are apparently set up specifically for them. Pawson & Tilley's 'realistic evaluation' model of contexts, mechanisms and outcomes is used as a framework for critical reflection on the project as a whole. The political and professional context for the studies, and their conduct, methodologies, findings and implications for service development are explored extensively.

AB  - The Transition Services program of the Onondaga-Dortland-Madison Board of Cooperative Educational Services (New York) has been identified as an exemplary school-to-work program that includes students with disabilities. The program serves students aged 13-21, most with disabilities; the majority have mental retardation, serious emotional disturbance, specific learning disabilities, and multiple disabilities. The program has been instrumental in reducing the dropout rate of at-risk students by increasing their awareness of opportunities available to them with training and a diploma. Students must be enrolled in an academic classroom and spend a half-day there and a half-day in the program. Transition Services is tailored to two age groups: students 13-15 participate in the prevocational training program; students 16-21 participate in onsite vocational training. During the intake interview, a vocational interest inventory and discussions with the student and teacher determine an appropriate job placement. A placement is developed based on interests, strengths, and availability of specific jobs. Ongoing evaluation leads to a variety of job experiences. Exemplary school-to-work components include the following: prevocational learning with hands-on training in various functional skill areas; community workplace experience/vocational exploration; and job coaching. Collaboration with local employers is an integral component of the program. (YLB)

AB  - These nine case studies present the diversity of local BCA operations and include the larger and better funded local clubs, as well as the smaller clubs that face daily problems of funding, staffing, and organization. The case studies include Project YESS (Youth Employment, Skill, and Service) in Omaha, Nebr.; Wilderness Challenge operated by the Boys Club of Hollywood, Calif.; Easter Hill Outreach Project of the Boys Clubs of Richmond, Calif.; Orcutt Boys Clubs Peer Leadership Program in Bridegeport, Conn.; the Family Centered Youth Development Program in Schenectady, N.Y.; and the Neighborhood Outreach Program in Las Cruces, N.M. Other projects are the Life Skills Socialization, Treatment, Remediation Project in Asbury Park, N.J.; Outreach Youth Development Program in Binghamton, N.Y.; and the FUTURE (Further Understanding Through Use of Recreation and Education) Project in Waco, Tex. For each site, information is given on the project's target area, outreach, services, client participation, training, and community coordination, followed by a discussion and recommendations. Evidence from the case studies demonstrates that a club must have certain organizational resources to be effective, including adaptable and workable program models that are as theoretically sound as they are attractive to youth, ability to attract youth at risk through effective outreach efforts, and commitment to work with other community agencies. Realistic financial support also is needed. See NCJ 82026 for the final evaluation of the project.

AB  - Schizophrenia and psychoses are debilitating disorders often leading to serious functional impairments. Early detection efforts have shifted focus to the prodromal phase and the emphasis is now on individuals at risk of developing psychosis. Aim The Longitudinal Youth- At- Risk Study ( LYRIKS) seeks to elucidate the biological markers of psychosis. This paper describes the application of a community-engaged framework to the outreach strategies of LYRIKS. It describes the outreach goals, strategies used and their impact, as well as the various challenges faced by the research team and community partners. Methods The target population was defined. Community organizations having close ties with the target population were identified and approached for collaboration. These included educational and healthcare institutions, and government and welfare organizations. Strategies were categorized as active or passive. Active strategies included clinical screening and recruitment, workshops, roadshows and student internships. Passive strategies included utilizing print and social media. Results Three thousand three hundred twenty-one youth were approached and 401 called the hotline to find out more about the study. Three thousand five hundred one were pre-screened; 864 were further screened using the Comprehensive Assessment of At Risk Mental State. One hundred seventy-eight and 346 were eventually recruited as subjects and controls, respectively. Conclusions Challenges encountered included differing priorities, maintaining collaborative relationships, stigmatization and inadequate understanding of the profile of at risk youth. Future community-engaged research should be conducted more comprehensively to generate maximum benefits.

AB  - In the spring of 1988 the South Carolina exit examination will be administered for the first time to determine if tenth-grade students will receive a regular diploma when they graduate from high school. School districts will be required by the Education Improvement Act to provide remediation to students who do not pass the exit examination, and these students will have three additional opportunities to take and pass the test. Concern exists that failing the test, particularly on the second administration, may serve as a disincentive for continued school attendance. School districts with relatively high dropout rates can act now to reduce their potential for increased dropouts following the exit examination. Districts can employ the following strategies: (1) self-assessment of school-based factors contributing to students' dropping out; (2) identification of students not likely to pass the test; (3) identification of demographic characteristics common to dropouts followed by development of appropriate outreach activities; (4) provision of remediation in skills the examination will test; (5) delivery of more frequent performance feedback to students and parents; (6) assignment of teachers and counselors to give special attention to those students at risk of failing the examination or of dropping out; and (7) development of a plan to keep students in school who do not pass the examination. (A chart identifying South Carolina school districts which need to take extraordinary initiatives to prevent the potential of increased dropouts following the exit examination is included.) (ABL)

AB  - The study examines boundary spanning activity between Hidden Entrance, a crisis outreach program in Prince Georges County, Md., and the county police departments. The program provides around the clock counseling in such areas as family crisis, runaways, and children in need of supervision (CINS). The program relies heavily on outside agency referrals. The treatment strategies are conceptualized in terms of temporary and permanent linkage systems. The first strategy focuses on a single mode of communication (e.g., an oral presentation) on a one-time basis. The second strategy uses boundary spanners in the development of a permanent linkage system and incorporates several transfer media used on a continuous basis. To test the treatment strategies, a randomized block design has been employed. By random assignment, two groups have been created, each consisting of one State police barracks, two local departments, one special department, and nine municipal departments. Research findings are based on data obtained from Hidden Entrance's records of police use of its services. The study shows no significant differences between treatment groups, in terms of the number of police referrals to Hidden Entrance. However, several qualitative and theoretical issues stem from the study. For example, a meaningful relationship between police and the program can be achieved through instilling more confidence among police relative to assistance provided by the program staff. To this end, the staff should consistently inform the police about outcomes of cases referred by the police. In demonstrating the use of experimental research methods, the study draws attention to the problems of implementing any 'different' strategy in an applied research setting. The importance of random assignment, in this case aimed at overcoming selection bias, becomes crucial when the experimental strategy is undertaken in the 'real world'. Statistical data, a discussion of previous research, notes, and about 30 references are included.

AB  - A longitudinal experimental design was used to compare the effectiveness of three community-based treatment programs serving homeless mentally ill people: traditional outpatient treatment offered by a mental health clinic, a daytime drop-in center, and a continuous treatment team program that included assertive outreach, a high staff-to-client ratio, and intensive case management. At 12-month follow-up, clients in all three treatment Programs spent fewer days per month homeless, showed fewer psychiatric symptoms, and bad increased income, interpersonal adjustment, and self-esteem. Clients in the continuous treatment program bad more contact with their treatment program, were more satisfied with their program, spent fewer days homeless, and used more community services and resources than clients in the other two programs.

AB  - This Research-to-Impact brief is the eighth in a series from Voices of Youth Count. Voices of Youth Count is a national research and policy initiative designed to fill critical gaps in the nation's knowledge about unaccompanied homelessness among youth and young adults ages 13 to 25. Voices of Youth Count research estimated that nearly 4.2 million youth and young adults in America experience some form of homelessness during a 12-month period. This brief summarizes research-based evidence on the effectiveness of interventions intended to prevent youth homelessness, reduce its duration and effects, and promote sustainable improvements in youth well-being. Accordingly, Voices of Youth screened nearly 4,000 studies, focusing on studies that evaluate the effectiveness of youth interventions. The screening process ultimately identified 62 studies that involved youth homelessness and evaluated the impacts of 51 programs. In this brief, critical evidence gaps are revealed that can prompt targeted investments in research and evaluation.

AB  - Despite the acknowledged need for effective programs to serve persons who are homeless and mentally ill, fete evaluations of these programs provide quantitative details on service provision. Such information can be useful to planners for replication and also for public policy concerning the need to mandate services most in demand. This report on a successful outreach intervention reports information on service amounts, duration, and types, as well as identifying predictors of service use. The overall amount of service provided to eligible participants varied substantially. While the median duration was only three months, repeat service episodes were common. For most clients, homeless project intervention included a variety of types of activities; most prevalent were housing, case management, mental health interventions and service entry, including engagement and assessment. Skill-building activities were relatively infrequent. Results from a cluster analysis, used to group clients based on patterns of services received, showed that groupings followed a focus on either: mental health, case management, housing, or a low overall level of fetal services. Surprisingly, no individual client descriptors or demographics related to cluster membership; only project site and recruitment source were significant predictors. The discussion suggests implications of these findings for other projects and sites and brings into question whether or not service participation and receipt by individuals who are homeless and mentally ill reflect characteristics of clients or of systems available to serve them.

AB  - This article summarizes research results from a demonstration project providing outreach or linkage services to homeless and mentally ill persons. Homelessness in the U.S. continues to be identified as a critical social problem and one that is still increasing in breadth, depth, and complexity. A substantial amount of public funding from federal and state sources has been invested in attempted solutions to the problems of homelessness and mental illness. Difficulties in conducting effectiveness research on services to homeless populations must, of course, be acknowledged. Although articulation of these research problems and potential solutions is no doubt helpful to research investigators in this field, attention to the conceptual models that underlie our research appears to be as important an issue but one that has received substantially less concerted attention. However, the categories of independent variables studied have been limited to client characteristics, program type, and, to a limited extent, service variables.

AB  - Kentucky's Jefferson County Public Schools evaluated their Positive Outreach Program (POP), which was designed to help elementary students with emotional, behavioral, or social problems overcome their problems and succeed in school. POP focuses on creating and enhancing positive skills, relationships, and environmental contexts. It includes school, home, and community-based interventions, services, and supports. Most participating students, who were referred by their principals, were male, black, and poor. The evaluation examined student characteristics, differences in students' non-academic measures, and changes in students' behavior following participation in POP. Data on attendance and discipline and teacher reports were collected at the beginning, during, and end of the program. Over 180 students were referred to POP. The program helped elementary schools help their students overcome behavioral, emotional, and social problems in order to succeed. Participating students' attendance rates increased, and teacher-based behavior ratings decreased positively and significantly. Four appendixes include the teacher-based behavior rating checklist, permission form, student information form, and student success plan. (Contains 13 references.) (SM)

AB  - Project Return, a dual-component dropout recovery program under the administration of the Program for Pregnant and Parenting Adolescents began operating in 1990 and by 1993 had expanded to 19 sites. The Community Education Initiative operated in seven elementary schools and one satellite site to target elementary school parents of all ages who had not completed their education (the Project Return component). The Babygram Hospital Outreach component operated in 11 health care facilities to target teens who had dropped out of school or were at risk of dropping out because of pregnancy or parenting. Both components used a case management approach. The Office of Research, Evaluation, and Assessment collected data from a variety of sources to evaluate the programs. In 1992-93, there were 1,096 new intakes by the Return component and 2,392 new intakes through Babygram. Outcome data, available for almost all participants, indicated favorable outcomes for the majority of participants in both programs. In Project Return schools, 81 percent of clients received a diploma or certificate, were promoted or retained at work, or secured employment. Recommendations are made for program continuation and improvement. Fourteen tables present evaluation findings. (SLD

AB  - The School/Community Program for Sexual Risk Reduction Among Teens (hereafter referred to as the School/Community Program) is a community-wide public outreach campaign. It incorporates multiple forms of outreach and public education to engage the entire community in preventing pregnancy among unmarried adolescents. Public schools, universities, church groups and civic organizations are all targeted as sites for training and workshops concerning human physiology, sexual development, self-concept and sexual awareness, values clarification, and communication skills. Abstinence is promoted as the preferred sexual health decision in all activities; for teens who do choose to become sexually active, effective contraception is encouraged. In 1982, the intervention was developed and field tested in a rural, low-income, and predominantly African American community. A significant drop in the pregnancy rate was recorded during the full implementation period of the program. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Rising rates of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits for psychiatric reasons pose a significant burden for healthcare systems in the United States. Utilization of outpatient mental health treatment by youth and their families may prevent some behavioral health crises requiring emergency services, as well as non-urgent ED visits where emergency care is not necessary. This study utilized de-identified electronic health records to examine seasonal and secular patterns in both psychiatric ED presentation and outpatient mental health care utilization among youth, as well as the association of outpatient mental health care with psychiatric ED visits. Racial/ethnic differences in service utilization were also examined. The study sample consisted of 25,545 school-aged youth who were diagnosed with an emotional or behavioral disorder and received services at Boston Medical Center (BMC) between 2009 and 2018. Results indicate significant seasonal patterns in both psychiatric ED visits and outpatient mental healthcare that parallel the school calendar, with more youth receiving services during the school year than in the summer. Mental healthcare among youth of color was more closely aligned with the school calendar than among White youth, suggesting that schools may be more instrumental for the referral of youth of color into mental healthcare than for White youth. In addition, youth who accessed outpatient care were at decreased risk for psychiatric ED presentation as compared to youth who had not accessed outpatient services. Longer duration of outpatient treatment and a greater number of visits were associated with increased risk for ED presentation, whereas greater frequency of visits was associated with decreased risk for ED presentation. Findings suggest that preventive outreach for youth and families may be particularly helpful in late summer and early winter, prior to significant increases in both psychiatric ED visits and outpatient service use.

AB  - 'Targeted Outreach,' which is a delinquency intervention program operated by the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, recruits young people identified by clearly defined criteria as at-risk and directs them into core program activities. The activities are designed to promote a sense of belonging, a sense of competence, a sense of usefulness, and a sense of power or influence. The 'Court Appointed Special Advocates' program is designed to ensure the courts are familiar with the needs of any neglected or abused child. The advocates are trained in the juvenile justice system, State and Federal child abuse laws, child development, the social service delivery system, and the dynamics of child abuse and neglect. Volunteer advocates are appointed by judges to conduct independent investigations of children's circumstances and recommend to the court the placement and treatment that serves the child's best interests. 'Permanent Families for Abused and Neglected Children' is a training and technical assistance project of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. This project is designed to prevent unnecessary foster care placements, reunite children already in foster homes with their families, and facilitate permanent adoptive homes when reunification is not practical.

AB  - The Youth Environmental Service (YES) aims to rehabilitate adjudicated delinquents and to prevent at-risk youth from entering the juvenile justice system by engaging them in environmental work and education programs on federally owned land. YES is a joint program of the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). Partnerships are formed among federal, state, local, and private agencies to develop these environmental work programs. States and localities have broad flexibility to design programs suitable to their communities. Six pilot programs are described: two each in Washington D.C., Utah, and Florida. They range from weekend volunteer activities for at-risk preteens to a long-term residential program for serious juvenile offenders. Two programs are nonresidential and four are residential. For each program, information is given on the partners involved, program profile, target population, organizational structure, work or volunteer experience, program results, program costs, and program outlook. A table lists key characteristics of each program. Six factors contributing to successful program implementation are: a mutually beneficial partnership, team effort by partners in planning and implementation, prior experience in youth work programs, assignment of primary supervisory responsibilities to the youth service provider, ability of youth service agencies to absorb some program costs, and meaningful projects. Seven other issues to consider in planning a YES program are given, as are sources for additional information. (TD)

AB  - More than half of the municipalities in Norway report drug misuse as the most important public health challenge. Following a whole‐of‐government tradition, the ambition is to achieve horizontal and vertical coordination between different policy areas to address complex problems, such as youth drug use, and avoid fragmented services. This study aims to offer new perspectives on how governmental structures shape local drug prevention. By including the perspective of both local policy makers and outreach social workers, we can come closer to understanding how local drug prevention transforms policy into practice. The study will thus explore how policy makers and outreach social workers describe the local drug prevention strategy and how the outreach social workers implement it in practice. An instrumental case study of one Norwegian municipality was used to investigate the structures for drug prevention in detail. Data were gathered through 14 interviews with public officials from the relevant policy areas and outreach social workers from a drug prevention outreach service. The data were analysed using a thematic framework analysis. This study demonstrated that the policy makers’ and outreach social workers’ descriptions of drug prevention highlighted the creation of good living conditions and promotion of protective factors surrounding at‐risk youths. This perspective may offer a broader approach to drug policy, which includes many policy areas. While collaboration was regarded as paramount, the policy makers described a 'siloed' organisation that made it difficult to collaborate. The outreach social workers, however, indicated that they were able to navigate the 'siloed' structures. We discuss the structural conditions surrounding outreach social workers that shape the implementation of policies, such as the resource perspective. The discussion shows that outreach social workers may act as a safety net for a potentially fragmented municipal structure for drug prevention.

AB  - • The study provides a much-needed youth perspective on the services they require. • At-risk youth depend on several services but struggle with navigating with the services. • The youths describe the outreach service as having legitimacy as a trustworthy service. • The outreach service promotes the youth's empowerment, in contrast to other services. • The outreach service aids the youths in navigating with the other services. At-risk youth often rely on different municipal services, such as child welfare services, social services and medical services. All of these services play an important role in preventing drug use and promoting well-being, following the health promoting principles in the Norwegian Public Health Act of 2012. While the goal is for these services to coordinate their actions, many youths fall through the cracks of the system. Some municipalities have developed outreach services aimed at helping these at-risk youth. This study gives insight into the relationship between the outreach service and the youths, and how the youths experience the outreach service as compared to other municipal services through individual interviews and focus groups. The findings demonstrate that the outreach service has legitimacy as a trustworthy service, emphasizing the importance of at-risk youth having trusting relationships with professionals. The outreach service also promotes the youth's empowerment, which was contrasted to the deficit-focus the youths experienced with other services. The outreach service's resource-orientation endorses the need for empowering-oriented approaches aimed at at-risk youths. The findings also show that the outreach service is able to aid the youths in navigating with the other services. We discuss the outreach service role as a "safety net" between disintegrated services in the municipal organization, enabled by their legitimacy as a trustworthy service and the empowering approach. The study illustrates the valuable role a service such as the outreach service can play, both for the individual at-risk youth and also on a structural level within a municipal organization.

These projects are carried out by Caritas Diocesana of Malaga, in cooperation with the municipality, working with children and young people and their surroundings. Using an assessment model of own creation, discuss two key factors that will help us to determine the possible effects of the project: personal autonomy and improvements in the relational environment of the youths. The results indicate an upward trend of students in areas as the family relation, empathy, etc. Finally, the report stresses the need to enhance and ensure socio-educational actions to social participation.

AB  - This presentation provides the results from an evaluation of the implementation and impact of the One Vision One Life (OVOL) program in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Modeled after Chicago's version of Operation Ceasefire, OVOL is a community-driven violence prevention initiative that includes problem-solving, homicide incident reviews, public and "behind the scenes" responses to all homicides, collaborative partnerships, programs for at-risk youth, conflict intervention and mediation through the use of outreach workers and street intelligence, public education, community mobilization, and outreach. OVOL was first implemented in three Pittsburgh neighborhoods beginning in May 2004. We assessed various forms of qualitative data to understand the form, substance, and dosage of the program's implementation. Using homicide, aggravated assault, and aggravated assault with a gun as outcome variables, we conducted a quasi-experiment to ascertain if these offenses were reduced after the program was implemented in the target neighborhoods relative to matched non-intervention control neighborhoods. The analysis also explored if OVOL displaced crime into or extended violence suppression effects to surrounding neighborhoods. The results are discussed in terms of informing the use of this form of intervention as a community-based violence reduction strategy. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - The Elementary At-Risk Program was an intensive counseling, guidance, community outreach, and family case-management support system for a selected group of acutely at-risk students (approximately 60 students at one level and 180 students at another) in eight Houston (Texas) Independent School District (ISD) elementary schools. Social worker services were the central feature of the support system, which was designed to provide a supportive and nurturing home and school environment in which the academic and affective problems of the students could be effectively addressed, thereby giving them the disciplinary temperament and resolve to appreciate learning, stay in school, and improve their academic performance. This report evaluates the effectiveness of the program in improving student self-esteem, attitude toward school, class attendance rates, and academic performance. The concurrent and multiple measures of program efficacy included social worker evaluations, teacher assessments, attitude surveys, self-esteem scores, class attendance rates, and standardized test scores of program students. Findings indicate that the program was instrumental in improving students' self-esteem and attitude toward school. Attendance rates and academic performance indicators did not show any improvements. Statistical data are provided in five tables and three figures. A 14-item list of references is included. (Author/SLD)

AB  - Children are traumatized by community and domestic-violence exposure as victims and witnesses. Being exposed to violence and being abused also can doubly traumatize them. Information on the effects of violence exposure on children is presented in this article, including developmental implications, resultant behaviors, and the most extreme reaction, posttraumatic stress disorder. Parental and caregiver traumatization also are discussed. Prevention and early intervention are very important both to reduce exposure to violence and to reach children shortly after exposure. An innovative program, the Violence Intervention Program for Children and Families, which is designed to work with police officers as first responders as a way to reach traumatized children earlier, is presented. The importance of community outreach for better prevention and intervention is emphasized. The conclusion stresses that, for infants and toddlers who may not have language to express how they are feeling, it is important to be sensitive to the unique experience and meaning of violence exposure for that child.

AB  - This paper explores how a peer-and street-based naloxone distribution program (Bmore POWER) reshapes narratives and practices around drug use and harm reduction in an urban context with an enduring opioid epidemic. Data collection included observations of Bmore POWER outreach events and interviews with peers. Bmore POWER members create a sense of community responsibility around overdose prevention and reconfigure overdose hotspots from places of ambivalence to places of grassroots action. It expands a harm reduction approach to Black communities that have not traditionally embraced it and that have been underserved by drug treatment programs. Policy makers should consider ways to use peers grounded in specific communities to expand other aspects of harm reduction, such as syringe and support services.

AB  - <bold>Objectives: </bold>Understanding suicide risks among Veteran subpopulations is a national priority. This study assessed risks of suicide, suicide attempts, and other-cause mortality among recipients of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Veterans Justice Program services as compared to other Veteran VHA users.<bold>Methods: </bold>Per VHA records, the cohort included 5,401,192 Veterans alive as of January 1, 2013 and with VHA utilization in 2012. Receipt of Veterans Justice Outreach (VJO) or Health Care for Reentry Veterans (HCRV) services in 2012 was assessed using encounter codes. Multivariable proportional hazards regression assessed risks of suicide (per National Death Index search results from the VA/DoD Mortality Data Repository) and attempts (per diagnoses and site reports) in 2013-2016, adjusting for demographic and clinical indicators.<bold>Results: </bold>Compared to other patients, Veterans with VJO encounters had greater risk of suicide (unadjusted HR = 2.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.30-3.40; adjusted HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.02-1.53) and attempts (unadjusted HR = 8.88, 95% CI = 8.45-9.35; adjusted HR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.00-1.11). Veterans with HCRV encounters had elevated risk of suicide attempts (unadjusted HR = 4.56, 95% CI = 4.00-5.20; adjusted HR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.24-1.62). Risks were also elevated for other external causes of mortality.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>Findings document increased risk of suicidal behavior among Veterans Justice Program recipients. These results have informed VHA suicide prevention activities.

AB  - When states do not expand Medicaid, there is a gap that leaves adults earning less than 100% of the federal poverty level uninsured. However, low-income young adults with mental health needs living in these states fall into a triple gap that prohibits access to affordable health and mental health care. Many of these low-income young adults do not have parents with employer-sponsored health insurance available, and they are not eligible for premium subsidies or Medicaid. This article analyzes the impact of Affordable Care Act provisions on young adults, deliberates the effect of these provisions in relation to health disparities surrounding access to mental health care, and offers strategies for social workers to engage in mental health advocacy, outreach, and prevention efforts.

AB  - The data was collected over a one-year period from various agencies that provide services to youth; they are categorized by age, sex, ethnicity, legal residence, referral source, living situation after receiving services, and requests for services not fulfilled. The most complex category -- status at intake -- includes prerunaways, situational runaways, justifiable runaways, chronic runaways, chronic and abused runaways, homeless youth, and homeless and abused youth. The findings indicate that shelters serve nearly equal numbers of males and females, almost half of whom are 15 years old or younger. Minority youth accounted for over half the sheltered population. After interaction with service delivery agencies, 70 percent go on to live in stable environments. In contrast, the clientele of outreach agencies is mostly white male, aged 16 and older. Only 40 percent get off the streets. Although most of the adolescents have multiple, serious problems, the primary goals of most agencies is family reunification in some form. The next best step is foster care, and if both these options are not feasible, independent living is often the only option. More emergency shelters need to be opened and long-term, transitional living programs established. 3 tables, 7 notes. (Author abstract modified)

Program activities included community meetings and presentations. recreational events, parent and client contacts, counseling, job placement, and returning youth to school. In addition, program staff developed a community network for resource and referral purposes. Recidivism data for a sample of 122 clients indicate a decline from 16 to 11 percent following referral. In addition, gang-related felony crimes decreased by 39 percent in targeted areas and 38 percent in control areas in the year following program implementation. During the time of the program, other community and justice agencies have developed gang crime-reduction program components that appear to have had an impact on the problem. Personnel in other agencies indicated that the and is needed in the community. Additional effort is needed in meeting the program's job training and placement objectives. Program effectiveness could be increased through improved program operations and administration and by increasing community outreach and linkages. 3 figures, 19 tables, and appended research instruments and supplemental information.

AB  - This report assesses the first year of a school achievement program in Lowell, Massachusetts (Lowell Achievement Program, LAP). The program targeted seventh and eighth grade students who were at risk for dropping out of school. The main goals of the program were to identify these students and to stimulate them to participate in their own learning process so that they would have a better chance to realize their potential. This was to be accomplished by offering remedial instruction, establishing a drop-in center, and providing Saturday and weekend experiences for the students. These students were compared to a control group of students who were not in the program. The findings of the evaluation were the following: (1) students who completed the program were more likely to be minorities than control group students; (2) absenteeism decreased among program students; (3) student attitudes and the number of suspensions among program students showed no difference; and (4) reading scores were improved by the program. More program development and outreach by the staff are recommended. Appendices include questionnaires and interview forms for students and LAP teachers, and the Wisconsin Youth Survey. (VM)

AB  - Aim: Adolescence and early adulthood is marked by physical, emotional and psychological changes, and is the peak onset of mental disorders. Internationally, one-fifth of children and adolescents have serious mental health problems, yet services catering to them are scarce. Locally, traditional mental health services are associated with much stigma. In 2009, the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT), a youth-focused outreach and assessment service, was set up to address service gaps and care barriers. Methods: CHAT's key offering is a free and confidential mental health assessment service to facilitate help-seeking individuals between the ages of 16 and 30 gain access to early treatment. Young persons' profile and assessment outcomes were collected and entered into a database. Results: Between May 2009 and March 2013, CHAT received 601 referrals: 40.1% (241/601) from young persons themselves and 40.9% (246/ 601) from school or community counsellors. 79.2% (313/395) of those assessed had mental health issues. 61.5% (243/395) were referred to specialist clinics and 28.6% (113/395) to school or community counsellors. Conclusion: There is a steady increase in our referrals; majority are self-referred or referred from school and community counsellors. This attests to the success of our general outreach and targeted capacity-building efforts. Cognizant of young persons' distress, CHAT continues to work with downstream services for continuity of care, which also presents opportunities to consolidate and expand our network of specialist and community partners. Future directions seek to address current challenges: having a mobile platform to complement our face-to-face assessments, and building collaborations to provide holistic services for young persons.

AB  - Background: The ELSIPS (Evaluation of Lay Support in Pregnant Women with Social Risk) RCT showed that lay support for women with social risk had a positive effect on maternal mental health and mother-infant bonding. This exploratory study examined whether these observed benefits would impact infant development at 1 year. Methods: A sub-sample of women whose infants were under one year who had participated in the ELSIPS RCT which randomised women to receive either standard care or the services of a Pregnancy Outreach Worker (POW), and who were contactable, were eligible to participate in the follow up. At home visits, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (3rd Edition) and standardised measures of depression, self efficacy, mind-mindedness and bonding were completed. Results: 486 women were eligible for follow up, of whom 154 agreed to participate. 61/273 were successfully followed up in the standard maternity care arm and 51/213 in the POW arm. Women who completed follow up were less depressed and had higher selfefficacy scores at 8–12 weeks postpartum than those who did not complete follow up. There were no significant differences in maternal outcomes, infant cognitive development, receptive communication, expressive communication, fine motor development or social/emotional functioning between groups at 12 month follow up. Infants of mothers who received the POW intervention had significantly better gross motor development than infants whose mothers received standard care (p<0.03). Conclusions: The provision of lay support to women with social risk may facilitate infant gross motor skill development at one year but there were no other demonstrable benefits. The effects of the intervention may be underestimated given that those women who completed follow up had better mental health than the original study sample.

AB  - Aim: To establish a comprehensive phase-oriented early intervention service for young people with early psychosis in south London and to evaluate its effectiveness in delivering user friendly interventions and better outcomes. Methods: The Lambeth Early Onset (LEO) and Outreach & Support in South London (OASIS) service has been developed incrementally over the last 6 years into 4 teams each addressing one of the phases of early psychosis: (i) prodrome/ultra-high risk (ii) untreated psychosis (c) acute inpatient treatment and (d) recovery/ relapse prevention phases. Research and evaluation have been integral to each team’s development with three of the teams configured as Randomised Controlled Trials. Results: During the first 6 years, 1255 young people in Lambeth were referred for assessment (963 to LEO and 292 to OASIS). Of them 578 were diagnosed as suffering from first episode psychosis (some before or after they presented to OASIS), 450 have been followed up in Lambeth by the LEO Community Team and 40% discharged back to GPs in remission at the end of their two years of follow-up. Compared to standard service, patients’ delays in accessing treatment are less, and outcomes at 18 months are better. Conclusions: The LEO and OASIS service now provide most of the mental health service requirements for young people with early psychosis in Lambeth. It represents good value for money and improved outcomes for clients. Further interventions are planned and ultimately it will be possible to evaluate the impact of each incremental step in the service’s development.

AB  - The project provides health education, risk reduction information, alternatives to substance use and abuse, resource referral, and access to needed services for vulnerable youth. Project youth educators are recruited from the streets, receive substance abuse prevention education and training, and work on a peer-to-peer basis with transient youth. Project goals include increasing the physical health and well-being of young people between 10 and 20 years old; increasing leadership and employment opportunities for homeless youth; and increasing alcohol and drug education, prevention, and risk reduction services to youth. The project has a full-time coordinator, 3 part-time outreach workers, 8 to 10 part-time youth educators, and 4 to 5 volunteers. An evaluation of the project for the period from October 1997 to October 1998 showed the project responded to 1,631 youths, with a total of 3,878 contacts through youth educators and outreach workers. The drop-in services project component handled 571 youths: 51 percent male and 69 percent Caucasian. Sixty percent were between 18 and 21 years of age and 22 percent were between 15 and 17 years of age. Homeless or disenfranchised youths comprised approximately 70 percent of the target population, while about 30 percent of the youths considered themselves in transition or traveling. About 81 percent were referred for medical care, shelter, and counseling; 50 percent were involved in project activities; and 69 percent were involved in education and employment-related activities. The project contacted 1,265 homeless and street youths in the towns of Eureka, Arcata, and Garberville. Homeless and runaway youths and those in transition were 63 percent female and 76 percent Caucasian. Services included medical care, temporary shelter, and counseling. About 3,069 health and education, HIV/AIDS, and local resources prevention materials were disseminated to drop-in and street outreach youth. Youth educators and volunteers involved with the project were enthusiastic and committed to providing holistic prevention services. The recruitment and training of youth leaders from the target population, however, proved challenging and provided an opportunity for improving the self-image of vulnerable youth. Peer outreach to street youth for substance use prevention services proved to be a positive concept, one that requires long-term commitment from the community and funding sources. 9 tables

AB  - Although occupational therapy services have been rendered in prisons historically, only one occupational therapy program currently exists in a county jail: the Allegheny County Jail Project (ACJ Project). The offenders who populate county jails experience occupational deprivation. The participants of the AN Project have benefited from occupational therapy intervention that was initiated during incarceration and continued following their release from jail in order to help them resume productive lite roles and to reduce the reoccurrence of engagement in criminal behaviors (recidivism rate). As of June 2003, the ACJ Project has successfully affected the lifestyle patterns of its participants and overall public safety by helping 63% of participants secure gainful employment and by helping 91.8% of participants maintain their freedom after prison. The purpose of this report is to describe the process and benefits of implementing fieldwork opportunities for Level 11 occupational therapy students in a best practice occupational therapy program in a nontraditional environment: a county jail.

AB  - Aim In the context of an increasing focus on indicated prevention of psychotic disorders, we describe the operation of the Clinic for Assessment of Youth at Risk (CAYR) over 10 years, a specialized service for identification, monitoring and treatment of young individuals who meet ultra-high risk (UHR) criteria for psychosis, and its integration within the Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP) in Montreal, Canada. Methods We outline rationale, development, inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessment, services offered, community outreach and liaison with potential referral sites, and our research focus on risk and protective factors related to the neural diathesis-stress model of psychosis. Results Between January 2005 and December 2014, CAYR has received 370 referrals and accepted 177 patients who met UHR criteria based on the Comprehensive Assessment for At Risk Mental States. Conversion rates to a first episode of psychosis were 11%. Our research findings point to high subjective stress levels, poor self-esteem, social support and coping skills, and a dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis during the high-risk phase. Conclusions Our efforts at community outreach have resulted in increasing numbers of referrals and patients accepted to CAYR, highlighting the relevance of and need for a high-risk programme in the Montreal area. Patients with psychotic symptoms can be immediately assigned to the first-episode psychosis clinic within PEPP, which has likely contributed to the low conversion rates observed in the UHR group. Our research findings on stress and protective factors emphasize the importance of psychosocial interventions for high-risk patients.

AB  - Objective: To expand the evidence base of the Supporting Father Involvement (SFI) intervention to include child welfare families. Background: Taking a preventive father‐inclusive approach, SFI aims to strengthen coparenting, parent–child relationships, and child outcomes. This study replicates 4 prior iterations of the program using the same 32‐hour curriculum facilitated by clinically trained staff, case managers, and onsite child care and family meals. Method: Participants (N = 239) included low‐income (median = $24,000) coparenting pairs, typically mothers and fathers/father figures, half of whom were Mexican American, with toddlers (median age < 3 years). Questionnaires assessing multiple family domains were administered verbally over an 18‐month period. Intervention effectiveness was tested through a randomized control trial with immediate treatment or waitlist–control groups using a moderated mediator structural equation model. Results: The model explained 49% to 56% of the variance in children's problem behaviors (intervention and autoregressive effects). The intervention reduced couple conflict, which reduced anxious and harsh parenting, leading to better child outcomes. The intervention was equally effective for community and child welfare–referred families and family dynamics pathways were similar across conditions. Conclusion: With its intentional outreach and inclusion of fathers, SFI offers an effective intervention for lower risk child welfare–involved families. Implications: Results argue for the utility of treating community and child welfare parents in mixed‐gender prevention groups that focus on strengthening multiple levels of family relationships.

AB  - Piedmont Technical College's (PTC's) (South Carolina) service area is mostly rural and contains widespread illiteracy, weak economies, sparse education funding, large high-risk populations, and poor educational aspirations and attainment. By 1998, in an effort to provide greater access to its rural population and improve retention efforts, PTC had established six outreach centers. These centers offered developmental English, reading, mathematics, and college skills courses. However, initial student success, retention, and growth in enrollment were limited. Positing that the lack of continuity in part-time instructors did not foster instructor commitment to the college or students, PTC created a position for a "generalist" at two small rural centers, someone who could teach in all developmental content areas as well as admit, test, advise, and register new and returning students. The "one room school house" concept has proven to be the glue that has bonded the students, instructors, and administration. Students at the centers see commitment from the college, consistency in personnel and expectations, and connections between their courses. Retention has improved, instruction is more consistent, less administrative time is spent hiring and training instructors, and the learning environment has been enriched for students and teachers.

AB  - Mentoring represents a widely used outreach intervention amongst higher education institutions. It is also judged to be a ‘particularly effective’ approach in widening access, with a significant amount of attention directed at examining its impact on those being mentored. In contrast, less consideration has been given to the benefits that outreach mentoring can bestow on the students who work as mentors. In response, this study explores an outreach mentoring scheme that deploys university students in selected secondary schools to work with targeted pupils over a series of sessions. It reveals that mentoring affords a similar range of benefits to those gained by students who support outreach and recruitment work more generally, and that have received consideration in a number of published studies. However, the findings also identify differences in the nature of the benefits outreach mentoring offers. These, it is argued, reflect the distinct character of this work. The study concludes by emphasising the need to ensure these benefits are recognised by the student mentors as well as the organising university. The call for recognition acquires added relevance when it is acknowledged that amongst the benefits identified are those associated with improved student retention and success, both areas of growing concern for practitioners.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine whether provision of health advocacy for homeless patients would reduce the burden of care for a primary healthcare team. The impact of a health advocacy intervention was assessed in a quasi-experimental, three-armed controlled trial. Homeless patients registering at an inner-city health centre were allocated in alternating periods to health advocacy (with or without outreach registration) or ‘usual care’ over a total intake period of 3 years. The client group were homeless people in hostels or other temporary accommodation in the Liverpool 8 area of the UK. The majority of participants ( n = 400) were women (76%) in their twenties (mean age = 26.6 years). Most (63%) were temporarily housed at either one of the women's refuges or Liverpool City Council family hostels, and all were registered with an inner-city health centre. Data on health service utilisation over a 3-month period was collected for all clients recruited to the study and direct health service costs were measured. Homeless adults who were proactively registered by the health advocate on outreach visits to hostels made significantly less use of health centre resources whilst having more contact with the health advocate than patients who registered at the health centre at a time of need. There was no reduction in health centre workload when the offer of health advocacy was made after registration at the health centre. The additional costs of providing health advocacy were offset by a reduction in demand for health-centre-based care. The results demonstrate that health advocacy can alter the pattern of help-seeking by temporarily homeless adults. The intervention was cost-neutral. The short-term health service workload associated with symptomatic homeless patients requiring medication was not reduced, but outreach health advocacy was used successfully to address psycho-social issues and reduce the workload for primary care staff.

AB  - Forty percent of U.S. at-risk adolescents exposed to high-risk experiences (e.g., abuse/violence, poverty, high-crime and drug-ridden neighborhoods and schools) exhibit internalizing problems, such as anxiety and depression. Depression and anxiety lead to suicide, substance use, academic problems, and eating and sleep disorders, and affect quality of parent-child relationships (National Institute of Mental Health, 2012). Resilience research within the counseling field has increasingly embraced a transactional-ecological model, in which the individual’s functioning and behavior is regarded within the framework of multi-directional relationships, including individual, family, peers, school, neighborhood, and community at large. The present quantitative-correlational research examined the relationship between at-risk adolescents’ participation in resilience-focused counseling and levels of anxiety, depression, and quality of parent-child relationship. Archival data that were analyzed were of 96 students in grades 6–12 from Miami-Dade County Public Schools who participated in the College Reach-Out Program during 2010–2011. At-risk youth were between ages 11–18, of low socioeconomic status, had parents without a college degree, and attended schools with high rates of suspension, crime and violence, truancy, and bullying. Of the participants, 45% were Hispanic, 33% African American, 2% Caucasian, and 20% Haitian. Analyzed data included paired-sample t-test for Anxiety and Depression and Relations with Parents scales of the BASC-2 Self-Report of Personality (SRP), and one-way Analysis of Variances (ANOVA) of total number of counseling sessions. The present study was consistent with literature and longitudinal studies demonstrating that youth and their contexts mutually influence each other over time. Results also indicated a significant decrease in the degree of internalizing problems (anxiety and depression) experienced by at-risk youth who participated in resilience-focused counseling. However, there was not a statistically significant difference in the parent-child relationships as perceived by the at-risk adolescent. Results also indicated that there was no statistically significant difference between the number of counseling sessions attended and Internalizing Problems and Relationship with Parents. By examining the impact of resilience-focused counseling on anxiety, depression and parent-child relationships of at-risk adolescents, counselors can implement best-practice counseling services that reinforce resilience, ranging from prevention to treatment, in schools and community and parent outreach counseling settings.

AB  - The causes and consequences of homelessness have been the subject of considerable social science research. This report details recovery from homelessness, or "exits from homelessness," through analysis of descriptive demographic data and correlation of success rates with participant behavior and intervention context. The 2-year evaluation examined the results of a transitional housing program designed to promote self-sufficiency through a family-centered approach. Data were provided by 217 Hawkeye Area Community Action Program (HACAP) families. A parallel evaluation of the Homeless Head Start Project (HHSP) was also conducted. The evaluation found that clients who completed the program realized greater gains in income and were more likely to maintain stable housing than those who did not. Successful intervention strategies included a strong relationship between case manager and client, and intervention of a sustained nature. Critical to a sustained exit from homelessness was the resolution of causal issues of homelessness, such as lack of income, lack of affordable housing, and domestic violence. The study concluded that improvements in intervention strategies are important to ensure program success. (Appendices provide verbatim comments from the program termination and follow-up surveys. Contains 28 references.) (SD)

AB  - This article reports the findings of a National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) services demonstration project that used a mobile case management team to serve homeless mentally ill clients. The project examined three issues: (1) factors associated with client engagement in case management, (2) clients' perceptions of how case management affected their quality of life, and (3) significant differences between clients who remained engaged in case management services and those who discontinued involvement. The results indicated that clients who received more frequent case management contact, had higher assessed independent living skills, were older, were less likely to be substance abusers, and had experienced fewer periods of homelessness and fewer prior psychiatric hospitalizations were more likely to remain engaged in case management services. After six months of case management, clients perceived significant improvement in their global well-being, living situation, use of leisure time, finances, and physical health. Implications for providing case management services to homeless mentally ill people are presented.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the Teen Outreach Program, a pregnancy prevention program, in 2 community-based settings. Methods: We evaluated the Teen Outreach Program, a 9-month positive youth development program, in 3 cohorts of youths from 2012 to 2015 in 2 states. In Louisiana, 7 agencies participated in an individualized randomized controlled trial, with youths randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition. Fourteen agencies in Rochester, New York, participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Results: We found no differences between the intervention and control youths on delay of sexual onset in Louisiana (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62, 1.03) or in Rochester, New York (AOR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.45, 1.77), or for sex with no effective means of birth control (Louisiana, AOR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.78, 1.78; Rochester, AOR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.13, 1.27) after controlling for relevant covariates. Conclusions: We found no short-term effects for the offer of the intervention. Research might be needed for the long-term and intermediate impacts of youth development programs on these and other adolescent risk behaviors.

AB  - The UCPP differed from past national programs in that it provided very modest amounts of funds to neighborhood organizations located in low and moderate-income areas and relied heavily on volunteerism, citizen participation, and developing coalitions with other groups and city agencies. Information sources for the evaluation included site visits to each city; structured interviews with grantees, project directors, and outside agency officials; and grantees' monthly reports and records. New York and Cincinnati served as intensive study sites. Property crime and arson prevention projects were the most successful, primarily because they were based on the straightforward organizing of citizens into block watches and tenant groups. These projects were also successful in obtaining support and assistance from police departments, fire departments, and housing agencies. More complex and tangible activities revolving around insurance unavailability and arson research did not attract much citizen involvement. Most victim/witness assistance and dispute settlement projects maintained high activity levels regarding community education, outreach, and development of referral sources, but encountered problems in involving citizens and building productive relationships with the criminal justice system. The evaluation recommends that community crime prevention programs emphasize organizing citizens as the basic strategy, that strong working relationships be established between such groups and relevant criminal justice agencies, and that the neighborhood projects receive substantial training and technical assistance. The appendixes contain a description of the evaluation methodology, program descriptions for each city and program ratings, and a survey of full-time volunteers who worked on the projects.

AB  - The Connection, a 15-month demonstration program which provided educational and social services to high-risk adolescents at South High School in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is reviewed and evaluated in this report. The program, conducted through a collaborative effort between the University of Minnesota and Minneapolis Public Schools, provided advocacy, tutoring, counseling, job preparation training, job placement, life skills training, chemical management counseling, and recreational and cultural services to adolescents considered at risk with respect to completing high school, becoming involved with the juvenile justice system, or finding suitable employment. The services were provided through structured classes, outreach, advocacy, and direct counseling interventions. Much of the direct service was delivered by part-time paraprofessional college students. Major problems with the Connection were related to organizational, public relations, and communication issues. However, the program received generally positive evaluations from clients and employers. Preliminary data also suggested that the program helped to divert its clients from involvement with the juvenile justice system. Unfortunately, the program's positive effects could not be expanded due to termination of funding. Appendices to the report provide client data, program summary data, evaluation materials, and financial information. (CMG)

AB  - An innovative, experimental, medical out-reach initiative, using a fully-equipped mobile medical van with a staff of 2 part-time physicians, a physician assistant, a social worker, and a driver/medical aid serving the needs of 1048, mostly male, minority group, high-level, homeless New York City substance users with infectious diseases is described. The study sample (N = 250) was divided into experimental S's who received Intensive case management and a control group who could choose to refer themselves to the SW. Biological tests revealed high rates of cocaine use and infectious diseases. Preliminary 4-month outcomes (N=128) showed reductions in drug use, homelessness and health complaints in both groups; experimental subjects compared with controls received more Public Assistance and had fewer emergency room visits.

AB  - Clients' and providers' perceptions of clients' needs were compared in 18 community treatment programs participating in the Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports program of the Center for Mental Health Services, a national demonstration project on treatment of homeless persons with mental illness. The study sought to determine whether perceptions differed and whether assessed needs for services were related to service use. 1,482 clients contacted through community outreach who entered the case management phase of the program after an average of 32 days were given an evaluation interview at entry into the program. The clients and outreach workers identified clients' needs in 7 core domains: mental health, general health, substance abuse, public financial support, housing assistance and support, dental care, and employment. The greatest differences between clients' and providers' perceptions of service needs were in dental and medical services, which were more frequently identified as needs by clients, and in substance abuse and mental health services, which were more frequently identified by providers. Clients' and providers' assessments of need were significantly, but not strongly, correlated with each other. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Evaluated the second of the 2 core questions around which the ACCESS (Access to Community Care and Effective Services and Supports) evaluation was designed: Does better integration of service systems improve the treatment outcomes of homeless persons with severe mental illness? The ACCESS program provided technical support and about $250,000 a year for 4 yrs to 9 sites to implement strategies to promote systems integration. These sites, along with 9 comparison sites, also received funds to support outreach and assertive community treatment programs to assist the 100 clients a year at each site. Outcome data were obtained at baseline and 3 and 12 mo later from 7,055 clients across 4 annual cohorts at all sites. Clients at all sites showed improvement in outcome measures. More extensive implementation of systems integration strategies was unrelated to these outcomes. However, clients of sites that became more integrated, regardless of the degree of implementation or whether the sites were experimental sites or comparison sites, had progressively better housing outcomes. It is concluded that interventions designed to increase the level of systems integration in the ACCESS demonstration did not result in better client outcomes.

AB  - Scand J Caring Sci; 2011; 25; 269-276 Families who experience a chronic complex of socio-economic and psychosocial problems are hard to reach with mainstream care. Evidence exists that the core of this problem is a problematic interaction between this type of family and current systems of care and services. To improve access to problem families, an assertive outreach intervention was implemented into the field of preventive child health care, the Netherlands. The study aimed to provide a more detailed insight into characteristics of the target group. Although there is consensus about some general features of hard to reach problem families, little is known about their specific characteristics because empirical studies among this group are rarely conducted. Especially, the problems of the children is shed insufficient light on. The studied population consisted of families included in the assertive outreach intervention delivered during one year ( N = 116). To assess psychosocial adjustment of the children, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was filled in by the parents. Furthermore, a Dutch questionnaire on family functioning was completed by professional carers. Descriptive data were calculated. The findings show that by using the assertive outreach intervention, programme staff came into contact with families characterised by a considerably higher than average proportion of single parents and unemployed households receiving social benefits. The families faced a high level of risk and a wide range of severe and multiple difficulties, including a lack of basic child care, an inadequate social network and poor parenting. Children in these families were also facing a number of risks. The proportion of psychosocial problems was well above the (inter)national average. The findings reveal the problem areas of unreached families and a need to improve the access to care for these families.

AB  - Notes that assertive mental health outreach is an effective method of engaging mentally ill homeless persons into treatment and case management and is associated with good client outcomes in several domains. This paper questions (1) how assertive mental health outreach can be adapted to work effectively with persons who have 'only' substance addictions and (2) how outreach teams can make a successful transition from working with one categorical group to inclusion of another group without losing focus or helping one group at the expense of the other. In addressing these questions, the authors begin with an overview of assertive outreach and some lessons learned over the past 2 decades of outreach experience. Emerging practice issues that are primarily responsible for bringing individuals with substance use disorders into the foreground of public policy and social service debates regarding the most efficient use of limited program resources are discussed. The authors end with a discussion of the challenges inherent in expanding outreach and some strategies that appear to be useful in this regard.

AB  - Abstract: In the context of an evaluation of a national demonstration program for youth addiction treatment in Chile, a sociodemographic and substance use profile of children and adolescents accessing services through this new program was developed. Information regarding sociodemographic factors, substance use, and problem severity; services used; and unmet needs was retrospectively gathered for all clients (685) admitted between January 1 and June 30, 2006. Thirty-two treatment centers (91.4%) provided data. The client population profile reflected severe psychosocial circumstances (e.g., 61.4% early exit from school). Of the population, 64.9% were classified in the highest substance risk level. The primary drug reported was cocaine-paste-base (52.7%). Comparisons to similar data in other countries illustrate the more severe profile of this Chilean treatment sample. The results suggest the need for increased outreach and comprehensive intersectoral approaches. Monitoring and evaluation should become part of the culture of the national drug treatment system in Chile and other countries.

AB  - The article examines the effects of outreach programs in promoting parental involvement to prepare preschool children for school, focusing on FL's First Start Program in multicultural Miami-Dade County. The program has enjoyed some successes with high-risk families, eg, those with teenage parents, learning disabled children, high levels of poverty, & suspected neglect & abuse. However, as the example of a teenage mother from Cuba, "Lourdes" points out, direct community outreach, which better prepared her to parent her children as well as the children for schooling, lost effectiveness when a convenient First Start program site lost funding & the family in question moved out of the state, eventually losing contact with the outreach activists. 6 References.

AB  - Abstract: Intensive Mobile Youth Outreach Services (IMYOS) were developed to provide specialist mental healthcare to the most ‘at risk’ and hardest to engage young people living in the state of Victoria, Australia. The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of the Orygen Youth Health (OYH) IMYOS, specialising in the treatment of 15 to 24year-olds living in the northern and north-western region of metropolitan Melbourne, who have severe mental health problems and histories of poor engagement with mainstream mental health services. An outline of the historic context and service development of the OYH IMYOS is followed by a detailed description of the fundamental principles for service delivery and core interventions. A case study is presented to illustrate the application of the treatment model. Finally, the current evidence base supporting the OYH IMYOS model is summarised, together with recommendations for the development of service models for ‘difficult-to-engage’, ‘high-risk’ youth.

AB  - Aim: Engagement is critical in ensuring that the most 'at risk' clients receive care from psychiatric services, but the relationship between engagement and treatment outcomes remains unclear. This study investigated possible improvements in client engagement and the relationship between engagement and treatment outcomes in a group of difficult-to-engage, 'high-risk' young people seen by the Intensive Mobile Youth Outreach Service (IMYOS) in Western Metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Methods: Data from standardized outcome measures on client engagement, suicidality, hostility, well-being and functioning obtained at referral, after initial assessment and at discharge, were analysed retrospectively. Results: Improved engagement was achieved after initial assessment and remained steady at discharge. All outcome measures showed significant improvement at discharge. Higher overall engagement following assessment was associated with decreased hostility risk and greater well-being and functioning at discharge. The engagement dimensions 'collaboration', 'perceived usefulness' and 'client-therapist interaction' were most consistently associated with better treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Engagement at an early stage of treatment can be a useful predictor for later hostility risk, well-being and functioning. To promote better outcomes for difficult-to-engage youth, service delivery needs to focus on collaborative client involvement, the development of a 'strong' therapeutic alliance and individualization of treatment in regard to client needs.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation is to review research on predictors of success when students return to high school, and to investigate the power of several risk and protective factors as predictors of success of students returning to school. Research findings regarding factors associated with initial departure from high school, returning to school, and repeated departure from high school are reviewed. Theories regarding departure from school are presented. A developmental psychopathology approach to predicting repeated departure from high school programs is presented which integrates cognitive, behavioural, social, and developmental theories. Findings are presented from a study on students returning to school who responded to questionnaires about demographics, vocational identity, stress level, coping style, and perceived social support. A total of 453 students participated who were returning to four types of academic environments: alternative outreach high schools (n = 267), a school for mothers (n = 46), a fourth year high school (n = 42), and college high school upgrading and completion programs (n = 98). The participants included 288 females (79 mothers and 209 nonmothers) and 165 males. The primary analyses were focused on how vocational identity, stress, coping behaviours, and social support predicted the outcome variables of attrition, attendance, number of credits completed, and grades at the end of the students' first 4 to 6 month term back in high school programs. Age, SES, and achievement were not found to be consistently predictive of outcomes. Males were more likely to leave school again, although no specific psychological variables were found to predict their departure. Females were found to be more likely to leave school again if they had a lower level of vocational identity, and if they had experienced a greater number of stressful life events in the year prior to returning to school. Gender, vocational identity, and life stress were not found to interact as moderators on outcomes. The results of this empirical study are believed to enrich theoretical understanding of success in returning to high school and will enable teachers and other professionals to more effectively evaluate and counsel students returning to school.

AB  - Overall goals of youth corrections include offender accountability and punishment, public safety protection and risk control, and competency development. In order to evaluate youth corrections in Massachusetts, the National Council on Crime and Delinquency tracked 820 Massachusetts Department of Youth Services (DYS) youth over a 4 year period. This study found that Massachusetts had been more successful in reducing crime among juveniles than other States studied, citing a 23 percent recidivism rate for youth compared with a 62 percent recidivism rate for youth released from California institutions. The Massachusetts youth corrections system includes small, secure treatment programs for serious offenders and a diverse array of community-based residential and nonresidential programs for less serious offenders. This network of programs is operated primarily by private providers under contract with the DYS, while the DYS operates several secure treatment and detention units for violent or serious offenders. Programs and services in the DYS continuum include secure treatment, secure detention, shelter care, transitional management programs, group homes, a homeward bound program, foster care, outreach and tracking, and health and other services. Juvenile probation services in Utah are administered under a statewide juvenile court system. Juvenile court judges meet regularly as a body and develop policies for probation services. Juveniles who are not eligible for probation, largely because of their current offenses and prior offense history, are committed to the custody of the Division of Youth Corrections (DYC). Service levels in the DYC continuum include community-based alternatives, observation and assessment programs, and secure treatment units. Factors responsible for the successful operation of youth corrections in Massachusetts and Utah are noted. Risk and needs assessment forms are appended. 12 references and 1 table

AB  - A program for women with schizophrenia that combines inpatient, outpatient, and outreach services is described. The program was established at the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto in 1995. Services include a comprehensive patient and family assessment, with subsequent recommendations to the treating clinician about differential diagnosis, psychopharmacologic and psychosocial treatments, and patient management during pregnancy and early parenthood. Other components of the program are home-based outreach services, substance abuse counseling, instruction of new mothers and parenting training, sex education, relationship-focused groups, and self-protection in an urban environment to prevent victimization. The clinic has established liaisons with pediatricians and gynecologists in the community to provide care to clinic patients. Linkages have also been established with agencies and facilities to fill gaps in the service spectrum, such as fitness programs and leisure activities and children's aid and protection.

AB  - Research was conducted to explore predictors for online higher education student attrition. This research was conducted using results from the SmarterMeasure Learning Readiness Indicator to track students in their degree programs. In addition, student outreach was conducted with an experimental group of at-risk students to determine if additional academic support promoted retention. Results demonstrated that verbal and physical learning styles and personal attributes such as procrastination increase the likelihood for attrition, while clear reasons for pursuing a degree and typing skills decrease the likelihood for attrition. Outreach to identified at-risk students did promote greater levels of student success and persistence. Recommendations for future research include comparing results from online and traditional student groups to determine if similar at-risk factors influence the likelihood of student withdrawal, and examining the characteristics of students who withdrawal before completing their first course. Moreover, qualitative research should be conducted to more deeply understand the reasons associated with online program attrition.

AB  - Psychology has much to offer those who deal with the problems of youth violence in American schools and communities. The Virginia Youth Violence Project is an effort to transmit psychological knowledge to educators and human services professionals working with aggressive and at-risk youths. Through training programs and outreach courses delivered to over 1,000 participants, the Project has spawned prevention programs throughout the state. This article describes the Project's teaching methods and emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, and it presents supporting evidence of the Project's effectiveness. The authors discuss critical issues for undertaking such a project and directions for future work to further validate and extend their efforts.

AB  - The purpose of this evaluation study was to analyze the impact of alternative placement on students challenged by academic, attendance, and behavior conditions as recorded in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) of the U.S. Department of Education. The U.S. Department of Education (1999) recorded numerous data through the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. The NELS:88 study recognized the following types of alternative placements: (a) school-within-a-school, (b) dropout prevention program, (c) street academy, (d) high school reentry program, (e) alternative campus setting, (f) program for teenage parents, (g) drug rehabilitation program, (h) alcohol rehabilitation program, and (i) gang prevention program. This study examines the backgrounds, families, opinions and goals, school experiences, and activities of students who participated in the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. The analysis of data from the NELS:88 survey instrument focuses on the alternative campus setting, the outreach program, the drug rehabilitation program, and the alcohol rehabilitation program. Conclusions were drawn from questionnaire data findings: The appropriate alternative placement program and/or setting is vital for the students success. The practice of the educational system as a whole, to place and provide the necessary support for a student in the proper alternative setting, if warranted, is essential. The initial placement for students who necessitate an alternative setting must be correct if the student is to be successful and return to the regular school setting. The one-size fits all alternative placement programs would be very ineffective with the majority of the students in today's world. Also, multiple placements would be unsuccessful and disastrous with the majority of the students given the results of this study.

AB  - Individuals with mental illness who are street dwelling present several public policy and service dilemmas. For 3 yrs, our research group has been involved in implementing and intensively studying an experimental program that was designed to test several propositions regarding how best to deliver services to this group. In this paper we recount the most important challenges that we faced in developing, implementing, and studying this experimental program. First, we will detail the rationale for the intervention and its overall design. Then we will discuss its implementation and the operation of our program model, the Choices program. The program has 4 major features: outreach and engagement, the Choices Center, respite housing, and follow-along coordination of on-site rehabilitation and support. We will end by highlighting some of the major findings from the study of 168 Ss from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - According to Scottish Executive statistics approximately 1000-2000 young people over the age of 16 cease to be looked after by local authorities in Scotland; research over the last 20 years has indicated that the majority of those ceasing to be looked after can face poverty, loneliness and isolation. Further evidence reports that 26% of those sleeping rough in Scotland had been in care. The Children (Scotland) Act of 1995 requires local authorities to provide aftercare for young people previously in their care, but the forms of aftercare available can vary. Focuses upon one such provision arrangement made between Dundee City Council and the Carolina House Trust. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Outreach and service linkage are key for engaging marginalized populations, such as homeless youth, in services. Research to date has focused primarily on engaging individuals already receiving some services through emergency shelters, clinics, or other programs. Less is known about those who are not connected to services and, thus, likely the most vulnerable and in need of assistance. The current study sought to engage non-service-connected homeless youth (N = 79) into a strengths-based outreach and advocacy intervention. Youth were randomly assigned to receive 6 months of advocacy that focused on linking youth to a drop-in center (n = 40) or to a crisis shelter (n = 39). All youth were assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 9 months post-baseline. Findings indicated that youth prefer drop-in center services to the shelter. Also, the drop-in center linkage condition was associated with more service linkage overall (B = 0.34, SE = 0.04, p < 0.01) and better alcohol-l [B = -0.39, SE = 0.09, t(75) = -4.48, p < 0.001] and HIV-related outcomes [B = 0.62, SE = 0.10, t(78) = 6.34, p < 0.001] compared to the shelter linkage condition. Findings highlight the importance of outreach and service linkage for reconnecting service-marginalized youth, and drop-in centers as a primary service option for homeless youth.

AB  - Objective Non-service connected, continuously homeless youth are arguably one of the most vulnerable populations in the U.S. These youth reside at society's margins experiencing an accumulation of risks over time. Research concludes that as vulnerabilities increase so do poor long-term outcomes. This study tested the mediating effects of service connection and personal control as mediators of cumulative risk and housing, health and mental health outcomes. By understanding the processes associated with therapeutic change among those with the most vulnerabilities, service providers and researchers can target those factors to enhance positive outcomes. Method Seventy-nine, non-service connected, substance using homeless youth were offered a strengths-based outreach and engagement intervention and were assessed at baseline 3, 6 and 9 months post-baseline. Results Personal control mediated the effects of cumulative risk on housing stability, and service utilization mediated the effects of cumulative risk on mental health. Conclusions This study specifies important targets of intervention for a population at high risk for continuing homelessness. In particular, service providers should target youths' sense of personal control and link them to needed community-based services in order to help them exit street life and improve mental health outcomes.

AB  - Homeless youth report high rates of unemployment. While homeless serving agencies usually offer employment services, most homeless youth are disengaged from homeless service agencies, and a limited number of studies have examined employment and other income sources among service disconnected youth. Our study examined income sources and change in income among service disconnected youth, all of whom received Strengths-Based Outreach and Advocacy (SBOA, N = 79). Findings revealed that over time employment and legal income from non-survival behaviors increased (e.g., governmental assistance and receiving income from friends and relatives), while income from survival behaviors decreased (e.g., prostitution, stealing, selling possessions, selling blood or plasma). Although unemployment among these youth remained high (62%), income from survival behaviors reduced most drastically. Findings also suggest that employment is linked to housing stability and mental health, as is substance use and income, which suggests that mental health, housing, and substance use treatment services are important components in income stabilization for homeless youth.

AB  - Three issues related to youth services in Lancashire, England, are examined in light of their success to date in youth crime reduction & proposals to increase their involvement in such programs: reasons behind the enthusiasm for such services as a possible solution for youth crime, ambiguity regarding the future of youth work, & the need for youth services to demonstrate their ability to perform quality work. Focus is on projects conducted as part of the Grants for Education Support & Training Youth Action Scheme program, 1993-1996, which had the objective of training the youth services to help teenagers at risk of becoming involved in criminal activity. Examples show that youth services' ability to assist at-risk youths produced positive results in crime reduction, which should influence the future of youth work. 34 References. M. Grounds

AB  - ABSTRACT This outreach programme forms part of a pilot study to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention by a group of third- and fourth-year trainee teachers in the lives of 35 boys living in a street shelter. The boys ranged in age from 6 to 17 years. All of them were currently attending local schools, with an age for grade discrepancy of up to 7 years. Two students are allocated to each child, and intervention over a period of 7 months yielded significant results, with a rate of improvement in specific school subjects of up to 110%. In addition, feedback by way of unstructured interviews, from schoolteachers, as well as childcare workers and social workers involved in the day-to-day lives of the boys, also indicated greater social and emotional gains. Documented evidence made available as a result of reflective diaries also served to confirm the advantages of this form of intervention. Both the students involved in the programme, as well as the boys whose needs they sought to address, have benefited both intellectually and emotionally from the experience. Quantitative, together with qualitative feedback supports the success of this community outreach project.

AB  - The Ounce of Prevention program, under the leadership of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), provided funds for community-based organizations to develop innovative drug prevention strategies using peer interventions and a youth-leadership model. Ten sites across the country were selected representing a broad spectrum of organizational structures, target populations, geographic locations, and prevention strategies. The goal was to reduce drug use and abuse among youth and create opportunities for at-risk youth to participate in these efforts. A major innovation of the program was the simultaneous funding of a prospective evaluation intending to assess whether the various programs were able to achieve their goals; provide 2 years of seed money so the organizations could become self-sustaining; identify the true costs of operating the program; and determine the effectiveness of the youth-leadership model in comparison to adult-led intervention. The evaluation was conducted over a 2 year period, from November 1997 to October 1999. It included an evaluation training conference for the program directors and youth leaders of the 10 sites and cross-site comparisons among the 10 funded sites, site visits, and in-depth assessments of the programs. Findings suggested that youth-led programs resulted in both immediate and long-term benefits to participating youth, youth in the community, the community-based organizations, and the community at large. Participating youth gained marketable skills, improved self-esteem, and directly reduced or prevented drug use among their peers through teaching, outreach, and one-on-one interactions. Many of the participants indicated that the program 'turned their lives around.' Then the sites learned that the program had been a victim of the Federal budget process and would not be refunded for the second year. However, program sites have been able to continue their efforts and it is clear that programs such as the Ounce of Prevention are beneficial to communities and the youth they serve.

AB  - Background: Unintended pregnancy disproportionately affects younger, minority, and low-income women. The purpose of this analysis is to describe our recruitment strategies and to determine if targeted efforts to reach women at greatest risk for unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection (STI) were successful. Methods: The Contraceptive CHOICE Project is a prospective cohort study providing reversible contraception at no cost to 10,000 women aged 14-45 years in the St. Louis area in order to evaluate method satisfaction and continuation and to reduce unintended pregnancies in the region. We describe four strategies for effective outreach and recruitment of high-risk women, including forming strong community partnerships. We analyze the evolution of baseline demographic and behavioral characteristics over the three waves of enrollment of the first 2,500 participants in order to assess whether our outreach efforts were successful. Results: Overall, >60% of participants were aged ≤25 years. There was a significant increase in the percentage of minority participants enrolled throughout the first 2,500 subjects ( p < 0.001). The number of women who reported trouble paying for basic necessities significantly increased over the three waves ( p = 0.025). Throughout the three waves of enrollment, there was a significant increase in the number of women who tested positive for an STI at baseline ( p < 0.001). Conclusions: A multiple method approach with collaboration of key community partners led to successful recruitment of hard to reach populations at high risk for unintended pregnancy and STI.

AB  - A small, city-wide clinical outreach service for the homeless mentally ill in Sheffield, UK, attained its present configuration 6 years ago. This paper discusses the lessons learnt in the course of the service's existence. The homeless mentally ill identified by the service have disengaged from the 'mainstream' services and society. Most are from disturbed homes, nearly all have had prior contact with psychiatric services and as many as half have served prison terms. As service users, they must be actively sought out and engaged, which places specific demands upon a mental health team: flexibility of approach, patience and a willingness not to judge others' values. Though largely anecdotal, the inferences drawn in Sheffield may have parallels elsewhere, not least since individual lives can turn upon pivotal ('anecdotal') encounters and those evinced by the homeless tell us much about society, psychiatry and the values of contemporary healthcare providers. Also, most of the time, the proposed model has been successful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The over-representation of mental illness among homeless people across the globe is well documented. However, there is a dearth of Australian literature on the mental health needs of homeless individuals. Furthermore, longitudinal research examining the factors that contribute to better housing outcomes among this population is sparse. The aim of this research is to describe the mental illness profile of a sample of homeless men in an Australian urban centre (in Sydney) and examine the factors associated with better housing outcomes at 12-month follow-up. Methods: A longitudinal survey was administered to 253 homeless men who were involved in the Michael Project: a 3-year initiative which combined existing accommodation support services with assertive case management and access to coordinated additional specialist allied health and support services. A total of 107 participants were followed up 12 months later. The survey examined the demographics of the sample and lifetime mental disorder diagnoses, and also included psychological screeners for current substance use and dependence, psychological distress, psychosis, and post-traumatic stress. Results: Consistent with existing literature, the prevalence of mental illness was significantly greater amongst this sample than the general Australian population. However, mental illness presentation was not associated with housing situation at 12-month follow-up. Instead, type of support service at baseline was the best predictor of housing outcome, wherein participants who received short to medium-term accommodation and support were significantly more likely to be housed in stable, long-term housing at the 12-month follow-up than participants who received outreach or emergency accommodation support. Conclusions: This study provides evidence to support an innovative support model for homeless people in Australia and contributes to the limited Australian research on mental illness in this population.

AB  - Objectives. To identify the factors associated with cessation of injecting drug use in young street-based injecting drug users. Methods. Subjects were originally recruited from various street-based outreach programs and had to have reported injecting drugs within the prior 6 months at baseline or during follow-up, as well as having completed at least 2 follow-up questionnaires. Follow-up occurred from January 1995 to September 2000. Cessation of injecting drug use was defined as having reported no injection at 2 consecutive follow-up questionnaires, averaging at least one year in total. Incidence rates of cessation were calculated and stratified by duration of injection. Adjusted hazard ratios were calculated in order to identify independent predictors of cessation. Results. A total of 305 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Of those, 119 (39%) ceased injecting for approximately one year or more. The incidence of cessation was 32.6/100 person-years, but consistently declined as duration of time spent injecting increased. Independent predictors of IDU cessation were: having at least one parent born outside of Canada (HR=1.4; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.1-1.7); injecting on a less than monthly or less than weekly basis on average within the last month (HR=6.6; 95% CI: 3.1-14.1 and HR=2.4; 95% CI: 1.1-5.5, respectively); injecting an average of two or fewer different types of drug within the last six months (HR=1.8; 95% CI: 0.9-3.5); and having been employed within the last six months (HR=1.7; 95% CI: 1.1-2.7). Independent predictors of not stopping injecting drugs were: homelessness within the last six months (HR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-1.0); and having attended a needle exchange program within the last six months (HR-0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.8). Conclusion. Cessation of injecting drug use among youth is considerably higher in the first years of injecting. Young IDUs with non-Canadian family backgrounds, as well as those who inject less frequently, inject fewer different types of drugs, and have a more stable lifestyle tend to be more likely to stop injecting drugs for a period of one year.

AB  - Young injecting drug users (IDUs) are at high risk for a number of negative health outcomes such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, very little is known about injecting drug-use patterns among this population, particularly with respect to cessation of injection. We sought to identify the factors associated with cessation of injection in a population of young street-based IDUs. A prospective cohort study design was used to assess long-term (>= 1 year) cessation of drug injection. Data was collected between January 1995 and September 2000 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Subjects were originally recruited from various street-based outreach programs in Montreal and, for this study, had to have reported injecting drugs within the prior 6 months at baseline or during follow-up and had to have completed at least two semiannual follow-up questionnaires. Cessation incidence rates stratified by duration of injection and adjusted hazard ratios (AdjHRs) were calculated. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to identify risk factors independently associated with cessation of drug injection. Of 502 young IDUs, 305 subjects met the inclusion criteria. Cessation of injection for approximately 1 year or more occurred in 119 (39%) of the young IDUs. The incidence of cessation was 32.6/100 person-years but consistently declined as duration of time spent injecting increased. Independent predictors of cessation of injection were currently injecting on a less than monthly or less than weekly basis (HR = 6.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-13.6 and HR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.1-5.3, respectively); currently injecting two or fewer different types of drug (HR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.1-4.0); currently employed (HR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.1-2.7); and having at least one parent born outside of Canada (HR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-1.7). Independent predictors of not ceasing injection were currently attending a needle-exchange program (HR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3-0.8); and current homelessness (HR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4-1.0). The early sharp decline in cessation of drug injection followed by a consistent decrease in this rate suggest difficulties in breaking the habit later on in the drug injecting career. Intensity of drug use and factors which may help to stabilize the social environment of the young IDU may also influence the ability to stop injecting.

AB  - We assess the impact after two years of two randomly assigned cognitive-behavioral community-based AIDS interventions for high-risk impoverished African American (N = 353) and Latina (N = 31) women residing in homeless shelters or drug treatment facilities. We also contrast the study participants with untreated, newly recruited controls. An in-depth Specialized program provided AIDS information, and psychosocial and behavioral skill enhancement; a shorter Traditional program provided basic AIDS information. Both treatment groups received information about available community resources. At follow-up, women exposed to either program reported significant decreases from their baseline scores in unprotected sexual activity, illegal activities (providing sex for drugs or money), cocaine use, heroin use, and high risk drug-related behaviors such as sex with injection-drug users and needle-sharing. After controlling for pre-existing differences between the groups and whether they were in drug treatment, we found that the specialized group reported less cocaine use and fewer illegal activities. Further comparisons with the untreated newly-recruited control group supported findings of improvement across the two years for both treatment groups. Implications for community-based AIDS health education efforts are discussed. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Efficacy trials indicate that an eating disorder prevention program involving dissonance-inducing activities that decrease thin-ideal internalization reduces risk for current and future eating pathology, yet it is unclear whether this program produces effects under real-world conditions. The present effectiveness trial tested whether this program produced effects when school staff recruit participants and deliver the intervention. Adolescent girls with body image concerns (N = 306; M age = 15.7, SD = 1.1) randomized to the dissonance intervention showed significantly greater decreases in thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, dieting attempts, and eating disorder symptoms from pretest to posttest than did those assigned to a psychoeducational brochure control condition, with the effects for body dissatisfaction, dieting, and eating disorder symptoms persisting through 1-year follow-up. Effects were slightly smaller than those observed in a prior efficacy trial, suggesting that this program is effective under real-world conditions, but that facilitator selection, training, and supervision could be improved.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety are prevalent mental disorders among the working population with potentially high personal and financial cost. The overall aim of this study was to test the applicability of an outreach collaborative model for early identification and treatment of clinical and sub-clinical mental disorders among Danish employees. This applicability was examined by I) investigating the fractions of identified and treated clinical and subclinical cases, II) describing the distribution and characteristics of cases identified and III) investigating the effect of allocated treatment. Methods: A longitudinal study design with four assessments (T0-T3) over 16 months was applied. Self-reporting questionnaires probing for psychopathology were distributed to all employees in six consecutively enrolled companies at the four time points. Employees meeting the screening criteria at T1 were assessed diagnostically. Subjects diagnosed with a clinical mental disorder were allocated to outpatient psychiatric treatment, and subjects with subclinical conditions were allocated to preventive cognitive behavioural therapy. Follow-up was conducted 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. We used chi-squared test and F-test to compare the different groups on baseline characteristics and mixed effects linear regression to analyse the treatment effects. Results: Forty (6.8%) of the 586 responders at T1 were diagnosed with a clinical mental disorder and referred to outpatient psychiatric treatment. Thirty-three (5.6%) were affected by a subclinical condition and referred to preventive treatment. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of the employees diagnosed with a clinical condition had never received treatment before. Symptom severity decreased significantly for both treated groups until follow-up. When compared to a composed control group, subclinical cases displayed a more rapid initial significant symptomatic decrease on the global symptom scale (coefs = − 0.914, 95% CI [− 1.754, − 0,075]) and anxiety sub-scale (coefs = − 1.043, 95% CI [− 2.021, − 0.066]). This did not apply to the clinical cases as no significant difference in change were identified. Conclusions: The outreach collaborative model demonstrated an applicability to identify both clinical and subclinical cases, among these a high number of employees with an unmet need for treatment. We found evidence of a positive initial effect on symptomatology from the allocated preventive treatment among the subclinical cases, but not for clinical cases. Trial registration: Retrospectively registered at December 18, 2018 at clinicaltrials.gov, identifier: NCT03786328.

AB  - Our study explored risk factors and birth outcomes of a community maternal and child outreach program for high poverty mothers in East and Central Harlem. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 75 mother-infant dyads, with singleton pregnancies, receiving antepartum and postpartum home visits. Inexperienced parenting was associated with increased odds of giving birth to an infant weighing <2,700 g compared to experienced parenting after adjustment for race/ethnicity and preeclampsia diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 4.9, p = 0.04). Mothers had comparatively lower depression risk in the postpartum period compared to antepartum (p = 0.006).

AB  - A consistent finding of the ongoing research of homeless populations reveals that those with alcohol, drug, or mental health problems (ADM) remain the most vulnerable and overrepresented group (Rosenheck, Bassuk, & Salomon, 1999; Stein & Santos, 1998). While mainstream resources play important roles in the care of the homeless, they are not sufficient in themselves to help the homeless, particularly those with ADM problems. Outreach and case management (CM) are often identified as two needed adaptations to the normal service delivery system (McMurray-Avila, Gelberg, & Breakey, 1999; Stephens & Dennis, 1991). As a result, this chapter reviews the evidence about the effectiveness of the diverse CM models and approaches for the homeless who experience ADM problems. Based upon the evidence of effectiveness, best practice models for CM services will be identified in hopes of enabling other social work practitioners and researchers to become aware of the empirically supported knowledge relative to work with the homeless.

AB  - Examined the impact of mentoring on the academic achievement of at-risk youth involved in Big Brothers/Big Sisters. Academic achievement tests were individually administered to 12 boys (aged 9.11–15.8 yrs) in the treatment group (i.e., had a mentor) and 13 boys in a control group (i.e., were on a waiting list to receive a mentor) pre- and post-test over a nine month period. Results indicate that boys in the treatment group made significantly higher academic gains than the control group, even after controlling for ability. Implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Aims: To describe the characteristics of homeless children and families seen by the mental health out-reach service (MHOS), to evaluate the impact of this service on the short term psychosocial functioning of children and parents, and to establish perceptions of, and satisfaction with, the service. Methods: Twenty seven children from 23 families who were in receipt of the ME-lOS and 27 children from 23 families residing in other hostels where no such service was available were studied. The MHOS was delivered by a clinical nurse specialist with expertise in child mental health, who offered the following interventions: assessment and brief treatment of mental health disorders in children; liaison with agencies; and training of homeless centre staff. Results: Children in the experimental group had a significantly higher decrease in Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) total scores. Having received the intervention was the strongest predictor of improvement in SDQ total scores. There was no significant impact on parental mental health (General Health Questionnaire) scores, Homeless families and staff expressed high satisfaction with the MHOS. Conclusion: This MHOS for homeless families is an innovative intervention which meets the complex and multiple needs of a vulnerable population unable to access mainstream mental health services. The primary objective of the service was to improve child mental health problems; however, the service developed in a responsive way by meeting social and practical needs of families in addition to its clinical role.

AB  - The article focuses on a recent evaluation of one secondary prevention pilot program--the Brimbank Family Outreach Service--located in the City of Brimbank, Western Metropolitan region of Melbourne, Victoria under the auspices of the Brimbank Community Health Service, by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, in partnership with Burgell Consulting. The Brimbank Family Outreach Service was designed to provide support and advice to "at risk" families not currently identified as abusive, to reduce the problems of at risk families in order to prevent them becoming child protection clients, and to reduce the need of such families for the provision of significant family support resources. Overall, the program evaluation demonstrated that the Brimbank Family Outreach Service played a significant, highly constructive role in the assessment and case management of at risk families who did not require statutory intervention. In the past, such families have often not received the treatment or support they required to deal with their issues and/or to prevent the occurrence of child abuse and neglect.

AB  - Evaluated a substance abuse treatment outreach program for homeless persons (HPs). The differences in drug abuse pathology and selected treatment outcomes among HPs and non-homeless clients and the extent to which HPs were unidentified in the drug abuse treatment reporting system of the state was also examined. Data were obtained from a health care for the homeless database and files from a state substance abuse management information system (n = 8,791). Composite scores on an addiction severity index for HPs were significantly higher on every measure in the interview vs non-homeless individuals. Except for residential treatment settings, HPs demonstrated a shorter length-of-stay in substance abuse treatment than housed clients. The outreach effort successfully located its targets. Outreach clients reported significantly higher levels of substance abuse than walk-in clients. 42.3% of outreach contacts became service recipients. These findings indicate that outreach was a successful method of targeting and engaging a segment of homeless substance abusers who were otherwise difficult to engage in treatment.

AB  - The ORP is a manualized, multi-component, 12-week cognitive-behavioural program for children aged 6-11 in conflict with the law. As part of a random control trial (RCT), 30 children matched on age, sex and delinquency severity at admission were randomly assigned to a treatment (TREATMENT) or no-treatment (CONTROL) condition. An additional 50 children matched on these variables who received the ORP prior to the RCT (MATCHED) were included as an additional comparison group. Results showed no significant gains for the CONTROL group, whereas both the TREATMENT and MATCHED groups decreased significantly post-program in terms of parent-reported aggression and delinquency. Slightly larger treatment gains were observed for older children in the sample. The most active component of the ORP treatment appeared to be the SNAP Children's Group which was significantly correlated with changes in delinquency, aggression, and long term involvement in criminal activities. Taken together, findings from this study provide strong support for the ORP as an effective intervention for antisocial children, but also illustrate the need of tailoring the fit between treatment components and client characteristics. ..PAT.-Unpublished Manuscript [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Conference Papers -- American Society of Criminology is the property of American Society of Criminology and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - In 1990, the Native American Prevention Project of AIDS and Substance Abuse began to develop, implement, and evaluate culturally sensitive in-school prevention programs for Navajo youth and their families. This project paper combines ethnographic interviews and observations with baseline quantitative data collection. A baseline survey of 174 9th- and 10th-grade students demonstrated a significant number of indicators that put students at risk of dropping out, including poverty, early sexual relations and unplanned pregnancies, physically and socially risky behaviors, and drug and alcohol abuse. At least five primary Navajo cultural themes must be accommodated in designing outreach and in-school programs that are relevant to at-risk Navajo youth: (1) individual autonomy; (2) experiential learning; (3) proper public behavior, including the need for public recognition of expertise prior to speaking on a subject; (4) family, including the extended family and other kinsmen, and (5) respect for elders and those with authority. The research suggests that prevention curriculum should emphasize culturally relevant practices that promote youth self-efficacy and involve the family and community. This paper contains numerous personal narratives from Native American youth interviewed. (KS)

AB  - Counseling services were provided from April 1979 to June 1981. Over this time, 83 public school students participated in the program, 57 of whom were included in a series of experimental studies. Counselors were college and university students who met youngsters on a weekly basis for 6-11 weeks. Program analysis results indicated that a major reduction of the truancy rate was achieved among progran participants. However, this reduction did not reach the 50 percent criterion specified in the program's objectives. In addition, no relationship was found between truancy and delinquency. Implementation problems included communication breakdowns between agencies, misunderstanding related to identifying and referring potential participants, and the inadequacy of data for evaluation purposes. Recommendations for similar programs included different programs for different types of students, involvement of family members, coordination of program activities with school personnel, and the use of peer friendship concept in outside activities. One table is included. (Author summary modified)

This chapter describes and evaluates the effectiveness of voluntary and involuntary approaches and presents a model program for serving this population. Topics include the magnitude of the homelessness problem; service barriers for the homeless mentally ill; New York City's voluntary outreach services for the homeless mentally ill (the linear continuum of care, the system as seen by clients, evaluating the effectiveness of the linear continuum of care model); the involuntary outreach system (police involvement, recent developments in New York State mental hygiene laws, New York City involuntary outpatient commitment pilot program [MHL 9.61]); and a consumer preference-based program model: from outreach to permanent housing.

AB  - The introduction to this LEAA grant report, which covers the period October 1978 to January 1981, first provides a summary of all services offered by the CRC and identifies problems of urban Indian adolescents which prompted the formation of the IYS program. A description of the IYS's administration addresses staffing patterns, including education and Indian tribe affiliation, training, supervision, and intake procedures. Program objectives and actual accomplishments are then outlined for the following areas: sensitizing public agencies to the special needs of American Indian delinquents, providing counseling and other supportive services based on an outreach approach, informing Indian delinquents and their families of their legal rights and responsibilities, and providing referrals to specialized agencies. Measures used to evaluate the program's effectiveness included total number of clients within a target population who were served, rate of return of youths to their families from out-of-home placement, and decreases in delinquencies. Over a 24-month period, the project served 83 clients out of an anticipated 100 families. Of the 43 youths in out-of-home placements, 58 percent returned to their families. A 24-percent decrease in repeated offenses by the youths involved in the project was observed. Overall, the evaluation results indicated that the IYS met its objectives and was a worthwhile service program to Indian youths and their families. Organizaion charts and tables accompany the report. The appendixes contain a schedule of staff training activities, lists of outreach contacts and referral sources, and statistics on clients' legal, employment, housing, school, and health problems.

AB  - Institutions of higher education (IHEs) that serve minority populations are unique both in their missions and in their day-to-day operations. Some of these colleges and universities are located in remote regions of the country, while others serve congested urban neighborhoods. Their constituents range from Native Americans, the country's oldest residents, to Hispanic Americans, who count themselves among its most recent arrivals. Some minority-serving institutions (MSIs), like Tribal colleges and universities (TCUs), are only a few decades old, while historically black colleges and universities have been in existence for more than a century. MSIs are both integral and essential to their communities. Through executive orders and special legislation enacted over the past 20 years, the federal government seeks to strengthen the prominent role these colleges and universities play in their communities and provide a structured means for these institutions to access federal funds. As part of this federal outreach effort, the Office of University Partnerships (OUP) in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers four grant programs for MSIs. This publication highlights the accomplishments of those four programs: (1) The Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) program; (2) The Hispanic-Serving Institutions Assisting Communities (HSIAC) program; (3) The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP); and (4) The Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian Institutions Assisting Communities (AN/NHIAC) program. Furthermore, it illustrates the important role that MSIs play in improving their local communities and the nation as a whole. Chapters 1 through 4 provide background about MSIs, their unique history and mission, and the challenges they face as they serve their target populations. Chapters 5-7 highlight the important work that 18 MSIs are doing to revitalize their communities, support local businesses, and help at-risk individuals and families build better lives for themselves. Chapter 8 illustrates how OUP funds are helping five TCUs enhance their infrastructure and expand their campuses so they can serve more students. Information about all minority-serving institutions that have received a grant from the Office of University Partnerships (OUP) since 1998 is appended.

AB  - The programs in the chapter on families address the most significant family risk factors identified by research. These are poor parental supervision, parental neglect, harsh or erratic discipline, parental conflict, long-term separation from a biological parent, and having a parent with a criminal record. The programs selected for inclusion in the chapter on school address significant school-based risk factors identified by research. These are low educational achievement, troublesome and disruptive behavior in school, bullying behavior, persistent truancy, and permanent exclusion from school. Programs in the areas of sports and leisure are included because constructive leisure activities are a well-established feature of initiatives designed to divert juvenile offenders and at-risk youth away from crime. The described programs encompass holiday activities for children, individual and team sports, outdoor adventure activities, recreation and leisure pursuits, and youth work. The format for all of the programs in all three categories includes a brief description of the program, its location, referral sources, core program activities, outcomes, and funding and costs. The concluding section of this report identifies common characteristics of the programs in each of the three areas, their cost-effectiveness, and general strategic approaches. 126 references

AB  - Homeless youth represent a chronically vulnerable segment of society whose mental health needs, despite their acuity and complexity, are often unmet. This article describes the development and implementation of a pilot mental health group intervention, the Housing Outreach Project-Collaborative Wellness and Mindfulness Group, for young people in their first year of transitioning from homelessness/precarious housing to independent living. The intervention aimed to provide evidence-based mental health support to a traditionally difficult to engage population. The development of group framework and content, implementation, resultant client engagement, and perceived successes and challenges are described. Considerations for future mental health interventions and research with this population are discussed.

AB  - Examined the relationship between knowledge of post-exposure prevention (PEP) following sexual or parental exposure to HIV and sexual risk behavior among gay men over time as PEP became widely available in San Francisco. The authors conducted 2 street outreach interview-administered surveys in June 1998 (T1) and January 1999 (T2). Between T1 and T2, there was a community-wide outreach campaign to raise awareness about PEP. At T1, the authors surveyed 295 gay men; at T2, they interviewed 234 gay men. The authors discovered that being familiar with PEP was not associated with increased sexual risk behavior before the community outreach program was conducted. After the community outreach program was undertaken, however, an association was detected between having heard of PEP and Ss' self-reported levels of unprotected anal intercourse. Ss who had heard of PEP at T2 were more likely to have engaged in unprotected anal intercourse than those who had not heard of the program.

AB  - This study is a randomized controlled trial of a failure to appear (FTA) prevention program involving street outreach workers. Over 2 years, 560 youth were randomized to receive street outreach services or no services based on an FTA risk score. The program was found to significantly and modestly reduce the likelihood of an FTA at the first court hearing following a summons (arraignment) but not subsequent hearings (case setting). No interactions were found for differential effects by race/ethnicity or gender. Although the program prioritized youth of color, the effects were not sufficient to substantially reduce disparities given the dispersed benefits to all youth. Implications of these findings for reducing race and ethnic disparities are discussed.

AB  - An estimated 1.6 million youth run away from home each year. While on the run, these youth are vulnerable to exploitation, victimization, increased dangers and perpetration of criminal behavior. Runaway and homeless youth are far more likely to engage in substance use and delinquent behavior, drop out of school and suffer from sexually transmitted diseases and mental illness at greater rates than the norm. Timely and direct intervention in runaway and throwaway cases is imperative to protect youth from the high risks of living on the streets. National Safe Place is an outreach and prevention program that is uniquely designed to provide immediate safety and access to services for any youth in need. In partnership with over 360 youth serving agencies and over 10,000 businesses and community organizations across the United States, the Safe Place program educates youth about alternatives to running away and homelessness and provides easily accessible links to service providers. Ongoing data collection indicates that National Safe Place has been successful in reaching endangered youth at risk of abuse, neglect or serious family problems but that expanded program models remain needed. The challenges and successes of current programming and the future of National Safe Place program expansion are discussed.

AB  - This report summarizes key implementation lessons from the six-city Community Change for Youth Development (CCYD) initiative, which investigated whether providing neighborhoods a framework of ideas (core concepts) would speed the process and increase the effectiveness of neighborhood-wide, resident-involvement initiatives aimed at assisting all youths residing in those neighborhoods. The core concepts were: adult support and guidance; gap activities; work as a developmental tool (work/learning); youth involvement in decision making; and support through transitions. Data collected from the sites led to the development of 10 lessons, including that it is possible to implement and sustain a neighborhood-wide youth development initiative, based on a common substantive framework, in resource-poor neighborhoods; research-based core concepts are extremely useful; variation and flexibility in the roles residents play, and commitment to clarifying and supporting those roles, are essential to integrating residents into such initiatives; older youth and high-risk youth are more difficult to attract to positive youth development initiatives and require targeted outreach; large-scale initiatives need a structured approach to assessing program quality on an ongoing basis; and place-based initiatives cannot draw a fence around a neighborhood. An appendix presents CCYD lead agency and sits descriptions. (SM)

AB  - The Under 12 Outreach Project (ORP) is described in this chapter as a program with the central objective of reducing police contact among a population at risk of engaging in delinquent conduct. The program has 2 primary goals: to decrease the children's antisocial behavior and to increase their social competence. Since the establishment of the ORP 2 major questions have been asked: 1) Is the OPR an effective intervention? and 2) Is it possible to develop a clinically relevant device that will allow tolerably accurate predictions of risk of future antisocial contact? For the past few years there has been an attempt to produce a simple, user friendly, manual for mental health practitioners dealing with children under the age of 12 who behave in seriously antisocial ways in their homes, schools, and communities. This chapter describes previous research and clinical efforts in this direction and outlines the most recent version of the Early Assessment Risk List for Boys (EARL-20B, Version 2; L. K. Augimeri et al, 2001). The authors conclude by showing that even after 3 years of effort the instrument is viewed as provisional and that the device must be validated.

AB  - Chicago's CeaseFire program is an evidence-based public health approach to preventing gun violence. Baltimore is one of many US cities attempting to replicate the program. We compared changes in the number of homicide and nonfatal shooting incidents per month in four intervention neighborhoods with changes in high-crime comparison areas (police posts) without the intervention, while controlling for several measures of police activity and baseline levels of homicide and nonfatal shootings. In South Baltimore there were large program-related reductions in homicide and nonfatal shooting incidents. Among three East Baltimore program sites, the program was associated with a reduction of homicides in one area, a reduction in nonfatal shootings in another area, and a simultaneous increase in homicides and decrease in nonfatal shootings in another area. In some instances, program effects extended to neighborhoods bordering the intervention areas. Program-related reductions in homicides appear to be linked with conflict mediations conducted by program outreach workers.

AB  - Project Return, a dropout recovery program to assist pregnant and parenting teenagers and parents of elementary school children to return to school, was first implemented in 1989-90, and by 1993-94 had expanded to serve 19 sites in New York City. The Babygram Hospital Outreach program, an outgrowth of Project Return, operated in 12 hospitals and health facilities to target pregnant and parenting teenagers at risk of dropping out. Both components used a case management approach, allocating an educational case manager to each site to recruit and counsel participants, coordinate educational alternatives, make referrals and placements, and track program participants. Evaluators from the New York City Board of Education's Office of Educational Research (OER) collected data on 278 program participants and referrals made along with pretest and posttest data on self-esteem and parenting skills from a smaller sample of participants. In addition, OER conducted a longitudinal study of Babygram clients. Data indicated that case managers were successful in meeting the program goal of identifying parents needing services and in recruiting them into the program and placing them. The longitudinal study indicated that 59% of Babygram participants graduated or were still enrolled. Because of the lack of pretest and posttest matches, it was not possible to document program effects on self-esteem, but it appeared that program participation was associated with higher levels of self confidence and parenting knowledge. Recommendations are made for program improvement. Four appendixes contain tables of data about dropouts and program referrals. (Contains 16 tables and 4 appendix tables.) (SLD)

AB  - Babygram Hospital Outreach, under the administration of the Program for Pregnant and Parenting Services and in conjunction with the Health and Hospital Corporation, is a program to assist pregnant and parenting teens to return to an educational setting. With funding from the Federal School Dropout Demonstration Assistance program, Babygram began operating in four hospital sites in 1991. By 1994-95 the program had expanded to 12 sites. Babygram used a case management approach, with an educational case manager at each site to identify teens in need of services, coordinate educational activities, make referrals, and follow the progress of teens who have been referred for services. Program data came from a variety of sources, including questionnaires completed by some participants, and interviews with 28 students. Case managers were successful in meeting their central goals of identifying pregnant and parenting teens who had dropped out or were at risk of dropping out of school and placing them in educational settings. Data from 774 participants indicated that, on average, clients were 16 years old and had completed no more than ninth grade. Case managers had an average of 34 new intakes each month and made 214 referrals each month on the average. Although the majority of educational referrals resulted in placements in schools or programs, the objective to increase the number of teens placed in educational settings was not met. However, three-fourths of the teens who were referred to educational settings had positive outcomes. Recommendations are made for program improvement and improved outreach. (Contains nine tables.)

AB  - Adolescence is crucial for career development, as youth begin to engage in activities to prepare for their careers. However, at-risk and rural youth may face barriers to developing useful career traits like career adaptability and work hope. One barrier is insufficient parental support. Parental support is associated with the development of skills and characteristics that promote career success (Keller & Whiston, 2008). However, certain personal and social variables, including grit and mentoring relationships, may help youth succeed despite inadequate parental support. Additionally, programs that engage at-risk youth in work-related tasks and experiences may help youth develop positive career trajectories. Therefore, youth work programs must be evaluated, given their potential to impact career development. The research involved 106 youth ages 14-23 who participated in summer work-training programs. Participants took a pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up to examine change in program goals over time, and identify relationships and personal characteristics that can help youth develop career adaptability and work hope. Study one examined outcomes consistent with program goals to assess program effectiveness. Linear regression analyses showed that worksite performance only increased for those who had previously worked, such that those with more previous work experience had greater improvement in worksite performance. Multilevel models showed a significant or marginally significant increase in understanding the value of school and career adaptability over time. No significant increase was found for leadership and work hope. T-tests showed worksite supervisors scored the quality of their mentoring relationship with participants significantly higher than participants, and regression analyses showed participant perceptions of the mentoring relationship did not predict the continuity of the relationship three months later. The second study focused on personal characteristics and social relationships that are related to career adaptability and work hope. Multilevel models showed parental support and grit significantly positively predicted career adaptability and work hope. Grit moderated the relation between parent support and career adaptability, but not parent support and work hope. No findings were significant regarding perceived mentoring relationship or changes over time. The discussion focuses on program effectiveness, future directions, ways to improve programming, and ways to promote career traits.

AB  - Developed and evaluated an AIDS prevention training program, Project AIDS Risk Reduction for IV Drug Users (ARRIVE), for parolees recently released from prison with histories of drug injection. Key program elements included a social learning approach to prevention that emphasized resistance skills training, a self-help orientation stressing individual responsibility, and therapeutic community principles such as credible role models and community building. Another element was job readiness training for the AIDS prevention/outreach field. A total of 394 eligible parolees were recruited, of whom 241 attended the program, including 164 completers. One yr follow-up results showed that ARRIVE participation significantly decreased certain sexual and drug-related risk behaviors and improved parolees' community adjustment.

AB  - Discusses the model of health care used by the Boston HIV Adolescent Provider and Peer Education Network for Services (HAPPENS) Program, which provides services for homeless, at-risk, and HIV-positive youth (ages 12–24 yrs). Boston HAPPENS provides a citywide network of culturally and developmentally appropriate adolescent-specific care, including: (a) outreach and risk-reduction counseling through professional and adult-supervised peer staff, (b) access to appropriate HIV counseling and testing support services, (c) life management counseling (mental health intake and visits as part of health care and at times of crisis), (d) health status screening and services needs assessment, (e) client-focused, comprehensive, multidisciplinary care and support, (f) follow-up and outreach to ensure continuing care, and (g) integrated care and communication among providers in the metropolitan Boston area. This network of youth-specific care offers a continuum from street outreach to referral and HIV specialty care that crosses institutional barriers.

AB  - Discusses the model used by the Indiana Youth Access Project (IYAP), a model HIV care program being developed at the Indiana Youth Group, Inc. Previous studies indicate that gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth are at increased risk of acquiring HIV because of the stigmatization and social marginalization they experience as a result of their sexual identities. The IYAP targets the special needs of this special population by confronting institutional barriers which limit their access to HIV care services, assisting them in building stronger peer support networks, and providing them with professional case management and related services. The model incorporates a set of health, mental health, and social case-management services provided by trained professionals, and an extensive peer-counselor training and outreach program which targets street youth and other at-risk young people. The program has provided education and training workshops on the special needs of gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth to thousands of health care, education, and social service professionals both in central Indiana and around the nation.

AB  - Several cities in the nation have developed innovative programs to assist the homeless who are “living on their streets.” This paper describes one such program developed in Houston, Texas. The Homeless Street Outreach was a collaborative project of several service agencies in the greater Houston area. The outcome of this outreach project indicates that a coordinated effort can bring about delivery of more comprehensive services to the homeless population. The principles that emerge from the outreach include involvement of the homeless in planning and development, service agencies taking “ownership” of the project, and agency flexibility in delivering services to the homeless.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic shift in the provision of mental health services to children, adolescents, and their families. This shift has been marked by a movement away from restrictive treatment options toward the development of comprehensive community-based systems of care designed to keep the most challenging children in their homes, schools, and communities. Based on a model of intensive case management referred to as Wraparound Care, Vermont's statewide approach emphasizes aggressive outreach, use of the least restrictive treatment options, and care that is flexible, unconditional and child- and family-centered. We chart the development of Vermont's Wraparound Care Initiative and present residential, educational, and behavioral outcome data for a cohort of 40 youth receiving Wraparound Care over a 12-month period. The results showed that after 12-months, youth who had been previously removed from their homes or were at imminent risk of such removal were residing in significantly less restrictive community-based living arrangements and exhibiting significantly fewer problem behaviors than at intake. These results are discussed in light of recent national studies and previous studies on similar cohorts of Vermont youth receiving Wraparound Care.

AB  - The Teaching/Learning Center (T/LC) for "at-risk" students is an on-campus tutoring program designed to "desaturate" the local schools surrounding Jacksonville State University of excessive numbers of preservice teachers, to provide practicum experiences for preservice teachers under state education agency guidelines, and to serve an "at-risk" student population in the surrounding area. The T/LC operates under the umbrella of the Instructional Services Unit in a three-way program which includes a Technical Assistance Center and a Learning Resource Center. Preservice teachers engage in "hands-on" teaching/tutoring activities; computer managed instruction; planning and implementing instruction; preparing test items and giving diagnostic tests; and preparing alternative modes of instruction. As an extension of this tutoring program, the T/LC began a trial outreach program in the fall of 1990 for 79 "at-risk" students at a local elementary school. This special program targets economically disadvantaged students who cannot travel to the university site. If successful, this outreach program may be expanded to include additional public school sites. The overall impact of the T/LC has been to reduce the drop-out rate, increase students' test performance scores, and strengthen preservice teachers' teaching competencies. (Two tables of data are included, and an appendix contains a sample letter to parents.) (Author/SR)

AB  - Comments on an article by William R. McFarlane et al. (see record [rid]2015-11728-012[/rid]). In the study of McFarlane et al. a community outreach program was set up to reduce the transition to psychosis in subjects at increased risk. A broad range of subjects (aged 15–25) was included, from low risk to frank psychosis. The design was not randomized on the basis of ethical considerations. Treatment consisted of family-aided assertive community treatment (FACT) and medication in the form of aripiprazole or, if not tolerated, other antipsychotics were allowed. The control condition (applied to only 25% of the study population) was monthly monitoring. Interestingly, conversion to psychosis was lower (2.3%) in the control group than the already quite low rate (6.3%) in the active condition group. Treatment was superior to the control condition in reducing symptoms. Most importantly, this study shows that compromising methodology for so-called ethical considerations is a problematic setting of priorities. In fact, this study mainly demonstrates that those patients who had more room for improvement and who were exposed to more intensive treatment had better outcome after 2 years of follow-up. The reason is that, for the above-mentioned ethical considerations, the investigators steered the more severe patients into the active treatment condition.

AB  - Closing the achievement gap depends on highly effective public schools, strong community support, and family involvement. Raising the overall rates of achievement in Minnesota is a vital part of this goal. Research has shown that pre-college outreach programs improve college access for underrepresented groups, including low-income, first-generation, and minority students. The most effective programs do this by promoting college awareness and attendance, improving academic skills, building student self-esteem, and providing role models. One study found that such programs can nearly double the odds of college enrollment for moderate- to high-risk students. Key features of an effective outreach program are discussed in this paper. [This briefing paper presents highlights of the report "Increasing postsecondary enrollment: A literature review of the effectiveness of outreach programs" with additional information from Perna's "Improving the transition from high school to college in Minnesota".]

AB  - Presents a letter to the editor that comments upon randomized controlled trials by Oliver et al. (see record [rid]2005-06800-005[/rid]) and Martin et al. (see record [rid]2005-06800-006[/rid]). It is noted that these trials of assertive outreach vs. standard community treatment for people with intellectual disability (ID) and mental disorders appear to show no differences in outcomes between the treatment groups. Both groups of authors accepted that there were major problems with recruitment into their studies resulting in inadequate power to detect a difference between standard and control groups. The second reason for the lack of differences in outcome were the lack of differences between control and intervention treatment, due to well-developed standard services offering elements of assertive outreach to the patients in the control groups and difficulties with treatment fidelity in the assertive outreach group. Other differences between the studies concern the extent to which the samples are comparable in terms of the severity of mental disorder. Overall, there appears to be a major difficulty in setting up research into assertive outreach and a continuing lack of evidence as to its effectiveness in this country for individuals with ID.

AB  - Abstract: Outreach workers meet with street-involved youth in their environment, and attempt to engage them in services vital to their well-being. The goal of this study is to conduct a systematic review of both the quantitative and qualitative research that explores outreach with street-involved youth. Using 16 outreach programs with quantitative information, our meta-analysis found that 63% of youth who are contacted through outreach later participate in the offered service. Our meta-synthesis of 31 qualitative articles on outreach uncovered 13 themes across 4 conceptual domains of interest. Themes pertaining to the therapeutic relationship, flexibility, and youth-centric programming had a large presence among the majority of the articles. Outreach with street-involved youth, when characterized through a strong bond between worker and youth, is an effective strategy for involving youth in agency services.

AB  - Despite recent prosperity in the U.S., homelessness is still a widespread social problem. It is estimated that 25% of homeless persons have a serious mental illness. This article will review the literature evaluating prevention services and specialized outreach, treatment, and housing programs designed to reduce homelessness for individuals who are mentally ill. Although these interventions have been helpful in addressing the complex needs of the homeless mentally ill, it is difficult to measure how they have improved outcomes. It is even more challenging to determine whether the programs are cost-effective. Since public resources are used to maintain services for the homeless mentally ill, policy-makers must be informed about whether the best outcomes are achieved at the lowest possible cost. Following a discussion of the successes of the individual programs and the challenges they confront, several important questions are identified related to improving the efficiency of these programs. Although the establishment of such programs indicates that progress has been made toward alleviating the burdens facing people who are homeless and mentally ill, collaboration among all stakeholders--especially between the mental health community and consumer advocates--needs to be further enhanced. New research can be conducted in a way that improves how information is evaluated and used.

AB  - The purpose of this thesis was to gather information to justify a need to obtain funding for the implementation of a homeless youth street outreach program. Through a review of current literature, the risk factors, consequences, services available, and effective services for homeless youth were identified and discussed. A needs assessment was conducted in order to establish the gap in services for homeless youth in the city of Long Beach. Potential funding sources were explored and a single source of funding was identified as having parallel goals with the proposed program. Finally, a grant application was completed in order to obtain funding for the proposed program.

AB  - This digest summarizes a larger document of the same title which examines early intervention programs providing services and resources to encourage low-income/minority youth to finish high school and enter college. It notes provisions of federal law which encourage such programs and the unifying mission of the National Early Intervention Scholarship and Partnership Program. Such programs are seen as either broad early intervention programs, "academic outreach" programs operated by academic institutions and designed to encourage at-risk students to plan for college, or school-college collaboration programs. Programs are differentiated into six types: (1) programs established by philanthropic agencies, (2) federally supported programs, (3) state-sponsored programs with matching federal support, (4) entirely state-supported programs, (5) systemic changes involving school-college collaboration, and (6) college- or university-sponsored programs. Implications of the growth of these programs for college and university administrators are considered and include recommendations to coordinate institutional outreach programs with early intervention programs and document efforts to increase access to their institutions.

AB  - Alcohol use is three times greater among Indian youth than among adolescents in general. Research suggests that an adolescent's decisions concerning substance abuse may be tied to self-esteem and to peer associations and activities. This booklet examines three types of programs that have been successful in building positive self-concepts and peer support groups among Native American youth. The Eastern Band of Cherokee (North Carolina) sponsors the Cherokee Challenge program. This program involves 45 adolescents and their families in weekly meetings and monthly outdoor challenge activities that foster self-confidence, problem-solving skills, and group communication and trust. Working with an outreach worker, the Pascua Yaqui tribe in southern Arizona has adapted the national Girl Scout program to its community needs. The national organization provided assistance in getting the local program organized, training for volunteer leadership, program materials, access to camping facilities, and recognition for scouts and leaders through established awards and achievement programs. Window Rock Public High School on the Navajo Reservation (Arizona) has a peer support program for youth struggling with problems of their own or someone else's substance abuse. Groups of about seven students and two trained adult facilitators meet weekly to help students explore their self-identity and cultural identity, build self-worth, and reinforce good choices. Contact information is provided for each program. (SV)

AB  - Comments on an article by Anne P. DePrince et al. (see record [rid]2012-26358-002[/rid]). In this study the authors juxtapose victim agency (albeit a modest level) with the seemingly competing interests of the criminal justice system. The authors start by recounting prior intimate partner abuse (IPA) studies that have documented that victim-focused outreach has improved outcomes for victims, including less re-victimization by abusers, better quality of life, fewer psychological distresses and mental health symptoms, and more social support and effectiveness in accessing resources. While the sample size is not as large as one might hope, the Study's findings are critical and may help move us beyond the impasse and toward a more engaged dialogue. This is because the findings reveal that, at least in some situations, victim agency can coexist with traditionally perceived positive criminal justice outcomes. Among the findings from the Study that are most relevant to a conversation about agency are three, each of which reveals that when victims are provided outreach, outcomes, as judged by traditional criminal justice benchmarks, are not diminished, and may in fact be improved. The Study reveals that some degree of victim agency can coexist with traditional criminal justice system outcomes, thereby ensuring that we can move beyond the perceived impasse and into a more fruitful dialogue. Engaging the more complex questions regarding authentic agency and its intersection with the goals and principles of the paradigm is likely more challenging. I am confident that not only will the system do just fine, but in fact both the system and victims will thrive. I leave it to the talents of the authors of the Study and their peers to prove or disprove this theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) is linked to neurobiological changes and adverse health outcomes that persist throughout adulthood. ACE victims frequently use drugs and alcohol as maladaptive coping strategies, developing substance abuse disorders. Therefore, this population require evidence-based interventions to treat addictions, yet research on this topic is limited. Aim: The aim of this integrative literature review is to examine the effect of evidence-based interventions on ACE victims' substance abuse during adulthood. Methods: A methodical search of peer-reviewed literature was undertaken to identify relevant research. Seven databases (i.e. CINAHL, PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Social Work Abstracts) were utilized, resulting in 34 articles that met inclusion criteria. Findings: Cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapy, community outreach, social services, and technological therapies offer effective interventions for substance abusers. Cognitive-behavioral therapy yields positive results; however, all offer drug abstinence and may be used jointly to facilitate recovery. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals must be aware of ACE victim's unique needs when creating treatment plans. Nurse leaders must advocate patient-centered treatment to promote best outcomes. More research on ACE-specific substance abuse interventions is required to promote substance abstinence within pediatric and adult populations.

AB  - Objectives: The poor oral health of Australians experiencing homelessness negatively affects their quality of life. Better oral health is associated with having annual dental check-ups. Because there is limited peer-reviewed literature describing strategies that improve access to and uptake of dental care by homeless people, in this study we searched the grey literature to discover what strategies are used. Methods: The Informit database and Google and Bing search engines were searched using the keywords 'homeless and oral and dental services'. Bing and Google were searched unrestricted by site and Google was searched for sites ending in 'org.au'. Searches were restricted to Australia from June 2008 to June 2018. The first 300 websites were read, and those describing or linking to pages describing a strategy that improved access to or uptake of dental care were included in the study. The content of the webpages was evaluated and summarised, with common strategies reported as a narrative description. Results: Nineteen programs were described. Common strategies were providing free care, in-reach care, outreach care and the need to work closely with support organisations. Conclusions: To improve access to and uptake of dental care by people experiencing homelessness, dental services need to be free and organised in collaboration with support organisations. What is known about the topic?: The peer-reviewed literature describing strategies used to improve access to and uptake of dental care by people experiencing homelessness in Australia is limited. The authors could only locate two such studies, one based in Melbourne and one in Brisbane. Both programs had a similar aim, but used different strategies to achieve it, suggesting a lack of consensus about the best way to encourage dental visiting by people experiencing homelessness. What does this paper add?: This paper used the grey literature to describe common strategies used in Australia to improve access to and uptake of dental care by people experiencing homelessness. What are the implications for practitioners?: Dental service providers aiming to increase access to and uptake of dental care by people experiencing homelessness need to work collaboratively with support organisations and provide care free of charge.

AB  - This study investigated the association between program cultural competence and homeless individuals’ drug use after treatment in Los Angeles County, California. Los Angeles County has the largest and most diverse population of homeless individuals in the nation. We randomly selected for analysis 52 drug-treatment programs and 2158 participants who identified as homeless in the Los Angeles County Participant Reporting System in 2011. We included their living arrangements (indoors and stable, indoors and unstable, and outdoors) and individual and program characteristics (particularly whether their programs used six culturally competent practices) in multilevel regression analyses. The outcome was days of primary drug use at discharge. Results showed that higher levels of staff personal involvement in minority communities (IRR = 0.437; 95% CI = 0.222, 0.861) and outreach to minority communities (IRR = 0.406; 95% CI = 0.213, 0.771) were associated with fewer days of drug use at discharge. Homeless individuals living outdoors used their primary drug more often than any other group. Yet, compared to individuals with other living arrangements, when outdoor homeless individuals were treated by programs with the highest community resources and linkages (IRR = 0.364; 95% CI = 0.157, 0.844), they reported the fewest days of drug use. We discuss implications for program evaluation and community engagement policies and practices. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In 1997, the federal Office of Rural Health Policy awarded 3-year outreach demonstration grants to 45 projects to provide direct primary and preventive health care services to rural residents in 28 states. The grant program allows recipients to test innovative ideas against the challenges of rural health care delivery, such as provider shortages, geographic isolation, growing Hispanic/Latino populations in rural areas, and changing health care funding and delivery systems. Recipients must form a consortium of local and state agencies or institutions to work together toward project goals. All the projects in this funding cycle succeeded in their efforts, but the populations served and the models implemented were extremely diverse. Twenty-two projects focused on the specific needs of infants, children, or adolescents. Among other populations, women were served specifically by 7 projects, minority groups (Hispanics, African Americans, or Native Americans) by 16 projects, and the elderly by 9 projects. Thirteen projects focused their activities in rural schools or used schools as delivery sites. Ten projects provided continuing education opportunities to health professionals or social workers. Health education, health promotion, or disease prevention were the focus of 31 projects, with topics such as substance abuse, smoking prevention, mental health, nutrition, diabetes, and sexuality. Descriptions of the 45 projects include population served, services offered, innovative features, results, potential for replication, plans for continued funding, and contact information. (Contains title and subject indexes, a glossary, and a project locator map.) (SV)

AB  - Background: Homelessness is noticeable in many places, but widely ignored on a macrosocial level. People with mental illness and co-occurring addictive disorder are frequently among the homelessness. Method: An international systematic review and a German-speaking research in the database of the network for healthcare service research were conducted. The aim was to present current results of interventions for the homeless with mental illness. Results: Anglo-American literature describes community-based approaches like Housing First and Assertive Community Treatment. Both deliver robust results for housing stability and quality of life. The results for mental health outcomes are inconsistent. Research in Germany is comparatively insufficient. Outlook: Low-threshold or outreach services are beneficial. But the findings could not be transferred to local conditions because of social and legal differences. Currently, the problem is aggravated by social structural factors like the large numbers of refugees. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) Hintergrund: Wohnungslosigkeit ist ein vielerorts kaum zu übersehendes und trotzdem gesamtgesellschaftlich weitgehend ignoriertes Phänomen. Menschen mit psychischen Problemen und bestehender Abhängigkeitserkrankung finden sich überzufällig häufig in der Gruppe Wohnungsloser. Methode: Eine internationale systematische Literaturrecherche wurde mit einer deutschsprachigen Recherche in der Datenbank des Netzwerkes für Versorgungsforschung kombiniert, um aktuelle Ergebnisse von Interventionen für Wohnungslose mit psychischen Erkrankungen darzustellen. Ergebnisse: Insbesondere im anglo-amerikanischen Sprachraum werden viele gemeindenahe Ansätze wie Housing First und Assertive Community Treatment beschrieben, die gute Ergebnisse für Wohnstabilität und Lebenszufriedenheit zeigen. Gemischt sind die Ergebnisse für die psychische Gesundheit. Forschung im deutschsprachigen Raum ist vergleichsweise defizitär. Ausblick: Niedrigschwellige oder aufsuchende Angebote scheinen vorteilhaft zu sein. Doch die Befunde lassen sich aufgrund sozialrechtlicher Unterschiede nicht per se auf die hiesigen Gegebenheiten übertragen. Das Problem wird gegenwärtig durch den sozialstrukturellen Wandel mit dem Aufkommen Geflüchteter verschärft. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - NIDA is conducting seroprevalence studies among IV drug users and is collecting behavioral and medical data to examine factors associated with immune status and the progression from seropositivity to clinical AIDS. Prevention programs have included dissemination of information relevant to risk-reduction strategies, projects to prevent the initiation of drug use, outreach programs to encourage IV drug users to enter treatment, and development of new and evaluation of existing drug treatment modalities. Research has examined factors in the initiation of drug use; the relative effectiveness of methadone maintenance, drug-free outpatient and therapeutic community treatments; factors contributing to cessation of drug use and relapses; the effects of adolescent drug use, and special treatment needs of adolescent drug users. Other studies have examined the effectiveness of various risk-reduction programs in modifying drug injection behaviors and in encouraging entry into treatment. NIDA also has developed an AIDS policy, the objectives of which include preventing and reducing IV drug use, developing information on unsafe injection practices, establishing AIDS antibody screening within drug abuse treatment programs, monitoring clinical epidemiology of AIDS among IV drug users, identifying cofactors to AIDS, and assessing the impact of AIDS on sexual partners and children of IV drug users. 10 references.

AB  - This book contains 46 summaries of positive findings from youth interventions based on 64 evaluations. Each of the summaries follows an outline that includes these components: an overview, population information, evidence of effectiveness, key components, contributing factors, study methodology, geographic areas, and contact information (plus a section of additional resources for some studies). The summaries are organized in three sections: education and career development, building strong communities, and of interest (recent studies dealing with a variety of topics about youth policies and practices). Among the best known approaches described are the following: Career Academies, School-to-Work, Tech Prep, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, 4-H, Teen Outreach Program, Youth as Resources, and programs recognized by PEPNet (the Promising and Effective Practices Network). The report also summarizes evaluations of community schools and after-school, juvenile justice, and English language development programs. The report provides a resource of empirical findings (beyond anecdotal evidence) for policy makers and program practitioners to use to create and implement strategies to improve services and supports for youth, particularly disadvantaged and at-risk young people. The document also contains a table summarizing program characteristics and a bibliography of the 64 evaluations. (KC)

AB  - Outreach workers meet with street-involved youth in their environment, and attempt to engage them in services vital to their well-being. The goal of this study is to conduct a systematic review of both the quantitative and qualitative research, to explore the definition and effectiveness of outreach with street-involved youth. Using a random-effects model with 16 outreach programs, our meta-analysis of quantitative articles found that outreach engages 63% of youth. Our meta-synthesis of 31 qualitative articles conceptualized personalized outreach with 13 themes across 4 conceptual domains of interest. Themes pertaining to the therapeutic relationship, flexibility, and youth-centric programming had a large presence among the majority of the articles. Outreach with street-involved youth is an effective strategy, that is enhanced through a strong bond between worker and youth.

AB  - This literature review examines the ways in which college and university outreach programs impact Latino (and other minorities) high school students. This article demonstrates that the outreach programs outlined do aid in closing the gap of college enrollment for Latinos. However, a review of three representative programs—AVID, the University of California's Early Academic Outreach Program, and Upward Bound—reveals that the Latino students who exhibit the most need are summarily excluded from participating in the programs, thus leaving them on the margins of the educational system. One of the conclusions of this study is that the problem lies with the political nature of the programs, which causes them to have stringent eligibility criteria.

AB  - Comments on the articles by A. Domanico & M. Malta (see record [rid]2012-07535-008[/rid]); V. A. Frank et al. (see record [rid]2012-07535-002[/rid]); K. Hayashi et al. (see record [rid]2012-07535-005[/rid]) and W. Small et al. (see record [rid]2012-07535-004[/rid]). The research collected in these four papers does not form a single comparative study across multiple nations. In each of the four cases, the idea of the community in itself, acting for itself, emerges as a defining characteristic. Despite the obvious disadvantages that these groups face due to the extent of their dependence on indigenous resources, they all go to great lengths to demonstrate that they are, in fact, of the community and not brought in from the outside. This, too, is a question of legitimacy, and seemingly a much more important one than the matter of external legitimacy. All of the organizations attempt to collaborate with their 'clients' in program planning, service delivery, and research. Most of them routinely hire former or active drug users in outreach, data collection, or peer-to-peer training positions. And most seek to maintain a board of directors or other governance structure in which at least half of the members are of the target community. At present, these four case studies suggest that the most successful programs are the ones that are unofficially tolerated, and therefore not repressed. Along with the users themselves, user groups survive on the resources of their own kind. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Homelessness among children in poverty continues to confront schools, educators, and policymakers with major challenges. This commentary summarizes findings from 2 decades of research on academic risk and resilience in children experiencing homelessness. Recent research corroborates the early conclusion that although children experiencing homelessness share many risks with other disadvantaged children, they fall higher on a continuum of cumulative risk. Research also indicates resilience, with many homeless students succeeding in school. Implications for educational practice, training, research, and policy are discussed, particularly regarding school psychology. Evidence underscores the importance of identification, assessment, and administrative data; outreach and communication to ensure that mandated educational rights of homeless children are met; and coordinating education across schools and systems to provide continuity of services and learning. Early childhood education, screening, and access to quality programs are important for preventing achievement disparities that emerge early and persist among these students. Additional research is needed to inform, improve, and evaluate interventions to mitigate risk and promote school success of students facing homelessness.

AB  - Background Substance dependence is a major social and public health problem; therefore it is a priority to develop effective treatments. The treatment of opioid dependence is complex. Previous Cochrane reviews have explored the efficacy of pharmacotherapy for opiate dependence. This current review focuses on the role of psychosocial interventions alone for the treatment of opiate dependence. There are many different psychosocial interventions offered to opiate addicts, which are widely spread. There is some evidence for the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions, but no systematic review has even been carried out. Objectives To assess the efficacy and acceptability of psychosocial interventions alone for treating opiate use disorders. Search strategy Electronic searches of Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and LILACS; reference searching; personal communication; conference abstracts; unpublished trials; book chapters on treatment of opioid abuse/dependence. Selection criteria The inclusion criteria for all randomised-controlled trials were that they should focus on psychosocial interventions alone for treating opioid use disorders. Data collection and analysis Reviewers extracted the data independently using relative risks, weighted mean difference and number needed to treat estimated, when possible. The reviewers assumed that people who died or dropped out had no improvement (intention to treat analysis) and tested the sensitivity of the final results to this assumption. Main results Five studies fit the study criteria. These analysed Contingency Management, Brief Reinforcement Based Intensive Outpatient Therapy coupled with Contingency Management, Cue Exposure therapy, Alternative Program for Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program Drop-outs (MMTP) and Enhanced Outreach-Counselling Program. All the treatments were studied against the control (standard) treatment; therefore it was not possible to identify which type of psychosocial therapy was most effective. The main findings were that both Enhanced Outreach Counselling and Brief Reinforcement Based Intensive Outpatient Therapy coupled with Contingency Management had significantly better outcomes than standard therapy within treatment. This was regarding relapse to opioid use, re-enrolment in treatment and retention in treatment. At 1-month and 3-month follow up the effects of Reinforcement Based Intensive Outpatient Therapy were not sustained. There was no further follow up of the Enhanced Outreach Counselling group. The Alternative Program for MMTP Drop-outs and the behavioural therapies of Cue Exposure and Contingency Management alone were no better than the control (standard) therapy. As the studies were heterogeneous, it was not possible to pool the results and perform a meta-analysis. Authors' conclusions The available evidence has low numbers and is heterogeneous. At present psychosocial treatments alone are not adequately proved treatment modalities or superior to any other type of treatment. It is important to develop a better evidence base for psychosocial interventions to assist in future rationale planning of opioid use drug treatment services. Large-scale randomised trials are required with longer follow up stating methods of randomisation, allocation concealment and blinding. Where possible this should include intention to treat analysis, with power calculations performed prior to the trial. These studies can be designed and delivered to provide usable data for better understanding of this important component of intervention in the field of dependence.

AB  - The Voices of Youth Count initiative's systematic evidence review is the most comprehensive synthesis of evaluation evidence on programs and practices related to youth homelessness to date. Herein, evaluations of outreach interventions for youth experiencing homelessness are summarized. Outreach is a set of activities in which service providers send staff or volunteers directly into the community--often to the streets--to engage individuals who might not otherwise access supports and services. The evidence here includes only impact evaluations designed to assess measurable changes in outcomes due to specific programs and practices.

AB  - • A small number of studies showed reductions in youth homelessness. • A few evaluations showed effectiveness in preventing homelessness. • Most evaluations measured counseling and short-term well-being outcomes. • We need more rigorous evidence on shelter, housing, and outreach models. • There is little evidence on program effects for specific subpopulations (e.g., according to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity) or contexts (e.g., rural). This systematic review synthesizes effectiveness evidence on interventions to prevent and address youth homelessness. It was conducted primarily for a United States policy and practice audience but involved an international synthesis of evidence. We conducted an international search that included eleven major academic electronic databases, 13 additional relevant institutional web-based publication databases, and a professional outreach for published and unpublished studies of the effectiveness of programs and practices to prevent or address youth homelessness, in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. We searched databases for studies published or completed between January 1, 2008 and March 19, 2019, and we also reviewed earlier studies synthesized in a similar past systematic review that ended its search in 2008. The review included experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation studies of youth ages 13–25. We included studies that only used pre-post comparisons and denote lower rigor designs clearly in the synthesis. The search identified 4,387 potentially relevant unique publications. After screening, 66 publications representing 53 unique studies of 54 different interventions remained and were included in this review. The vast majority (83%) of unique studies were conducted in the U.S. Of the 53 unique studies, 22 (42%) involved some type of randomized evaluation. Many studies involved low rigor designs with weak counterfactuals, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods. Included studies evaluated a range of interventions, and we grouped these into seven broad categories. The largest evidence base on the effectiveness of interventions relates to counseling and treatment interventions to address mental health or health risk behaviors. Overall, these studies showed promising results, but few included long-term follow-up. A small number of studies demonstrated reductions in occurrence of youth homelessness and housing instability, including some intensive case management and support interventions without direct housing assistance components. The field lacks rigorous evaluative evidence of many of the program models on which communities and governments rely to address youth homelessness (for example, street outreach, transitional living programs, youth shelters, host homes, and rapid rehousing). Evaluative evidence is further lacking on how the effects of interventions vary by subpopulations disproportionately impacted by homelessness. Policy and community interventions to prevent and end youth homelessness require a robust evidence base to inform decision-making. This systematic review presents an important starting point to inform solutions across a range of intervention areas, and it reveals significant areas in which investments in research and evaluation are urgently needed.

Part I presents findings and recommendations from the National Commission for Employment Policy's work on U.S. employment in an international economy, patterns of participation in Job Partnership Training Act (JTPA) programs, and early intervention strategies for those youth who are most likely to have difficulty in the labor market. Part II describes the major activities of the Commission, including the continuance of its Congressionally mandated review of JTPA. A major part of this review is a study to determine the effects of JTPA performance standards on who is served and the types and costs of services. This part also includes a review of the Commission's outreach activities, including a hearing on issues surrounding job training in rural America and the problems facing displaced farmers in the Midwest, visits to employment and training sites around the country, and the first national meeting of State Job Training Coordinating Council Chairs. Part III summarizes the Commission's four formal meetings held during the program year. Appendix A contains the Commission's comments on the reports of the National Council on Vocational Education. Appendix B lists Commission reports. (YLB)

AB  - The Edge-Group work project in Zwolle, Netherlands takes crime prevention into the young people's environment and identifies their needs. It uses community resources to provide the young people with opportunities to meet these needs and consists of four workplaces decentralized throughout the region. The young people control the process, but it is a labor intensive service. Another example of the needs-based approach is the Mission Locale, a youth services set up in France. Centers are set up to facilitate the employment and social integration of young people, especially those who are unemployed, homeless, or have difficulties with the education system. Information is provided on services available and on access to these services, and staff monitor the progress of young people through these services. The implementation of a skinhead clubhouse in Gruppen, Sweden under the supervision of a social worker is presented as an example of giving the young people control over their recreation and funding under certain restraints.

AB  - This chapter on services for runaway and homeless youths presents data on the changes in the homeless and runaway youth population. The homeless and runaway youths of today are both older and younger, more involved with gangs and violence, and more culturally diverse than their predecessors, and they have high rates of substance abuse, pregnancy, emotional disturbance, and school failure. In addition, more gay and lesbian youths are at risk of being forced from their homes. The changes that have occurred in programs serving youths are identified, and the characteristics of effective programs are outlined. Effective programs are adolescent centered, community based, comprehensive, collaborative, egalitarian, empowering, inclusive, flexible, culturally sensitive, and affirming. Essential services provided by homeless and runaway youth programs include street outreach, substance abuse treatment and education, mental health treatment, acquired immune deficiency syndrome education and prevention, transitional housing, employment and training, education, and medical and dental care. Funding sources for these programs are highlighted, and the topic of interagency collaboration is addressed. 31 references.

AB  - This paper reviews social support programs designed to have a preventive impact on young adolescents. A review of supportive programs for reducing adolescents' risks of educational failure and poor health has identified a number of innovative school- and community-based support programs. School-based support programs are aimed at enhanced classroom participation, mobilization of parent and teacher support, encouragement of peer leadership, reorganization of the school environment to produce stable and supportive peer groups, and provision of school-linked clinics. Community-based support programs include youth organizations, youth participation in community projects, mentoring programs for inner-city youth, visiting nurse programs for pregnant adolescents, and special programs in black churches that are aimed at enhancing support to young adolescents and increasing their academic skills. An executive summary is followed by sections on: (1) adolescent transition and risk; (2) social support for adolescents; (3) ingredients of successful social support programs for adolescents; (4) supportive interventions for adolescents in the schools; (5) support from school-linked clinics; (6) community supports for adolescents; (7) personal support though mentoring; (8) personal support through outreach; and (9) directions for future research. A total of 58 references are cited. (RH)

AB  - School systems in the United States are not serving Latino students well, especially those from low-income families. This book examines difficulties encountered by Mexican-origin students--one of the fastest growing minority groups--and describes why some schools fall short and how others have improved student outcomes. The focus throughout the book is on positive changes that school staff, families, community, and students can make. Each chapter uses a different lens--culture, language, gender, family and community, and social and political context--to examine issues and challenges affecting first- and second-generation Mexican American children. Chapters are: (1) The Mexican American Student Population: Growth and Diversity (demography, immigration, academic achievement, innovative programs); (2) Cultural Perspectives on Learning (cultural influences on classroom organization and achievement, child rearing, parent education programs); (3) Language, Literacy, and Creating Bridges to Success (the bilingual education controversy, learning English, maintaining Spanish, special needs of migrant students); (4) Gender Issues in Mexican American Schooling (sex role attitudes, teen pregnancy, school factors, peers); (5) Creating Family-School Partnerships (family poverty, parent-school relationship, parent involvement, community outreach, successful programs); and (6) Political, Social, and Pedagogical Issues Impacting Early Childhood Education and Public Schools (immigration and education policy, politics of early childhood education, teacher training, intergroup relations). Chapter 7 describes organizations and programs that provide resources and services. Contains over 300 references, chapter notes, and an index. (SV)

AB  - OBJECTIVE: About one-quarter of homeless Americans have serious mental illnesses. This review synthesizes research findings on the cost-effectiveness of services for this population and their relevance for policy and practice. METHOD: Service interventions for seriously mentally ill homeless people were grouped into three overlapping categories: 1) outreach, 2) case management, and 3) housing placement and transition to mainstream services. Data were reviewed both from experimental studies with high internal validity and from observational studies, which better reflect typical community practice. RESULTS: In most studies, specialized interventions are associated with significantly improved outcomes, most consistently in the housing domain, but also in mental health status and quality of life. These programs are also associated with increased use of many types of health service and housing assistance, resulting in increased costs in most cases. The value of these programs to the public thus depends on whether their greater effectiveness is deemed to be worth their additional cost. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative programs for seriously mentally ill homeless people are effective and are also likely to increase costs in many cases. Their value ultimately depends on the moral and political value society places on caring for its least-well-off members.

AB  - Children and adolescents are at high risk for sexual assault. Early medical and mental health evaluation by professionals with advanced training in sexual victimization is imperative to assure appropriate assessment, forensic evidence collection, and follow-up. Moreover, continued research and outreach programs are needed for the development of preventative strategies that focus on this vulnerable population. In this review we highlight key concepts for assessment and include a discussion of risk factors, disclosure, sequelae, follow-up, and prevention.

The evidence for mental health impact of broader community-based interventions, e.g. community outreach workers, or service-based interventions, e.g. social prescribing and debt advice is scarce. Likewise, the availability of evidence for the mental health impact of policy level interventions, such as poverty alleviation or youth guarantee, is quite restricted.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The social, economic, and physical environments in which people live shape mental health and many common mental disorders. There are effective early interventions to promote mental health in vulnerable groups, but it is necessary to both initiate and facilitate a cross-sectoral approach, and to form partnerships between different government departments, civic society organisations and other stakeholders. This approach is referred to as Mental Health in All Policies and it can be applied to all public policy levels from local policies to supranational.

AB  - Reviews literature on the problem of homelessness, including current attitudes and policies and causes of the problem. It is noted that the homeless are estimated to number about 2 million and that almost half are suffering from alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or mental health problems. Survey data and evaluations of mental health outreach programs have raised basic questions about the responsibilities of policymakers and service providers. It is suggested that improved systems of coordinated services and case management should be designed to link the homeless population and the larger service delivery system. Establishing this link within a model community support program is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

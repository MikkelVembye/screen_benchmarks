AB  - This monograph presents a brief review of the literature on integrating students with disabilities into mainstream educational programs. It begins by clarifying such terms as normalization, least restrictive environment, mainstreaming, and integration. It offers a historical perspective with a Canadian emphasis. The research on efficacy of integration is reviewed in terms of academic effects and social skills. Limitations of efficacy research are identified, including definitions of the handicapped population, educational intervention factors, and measurement of the dependent variable. Cost implications are considered. The importance of identifying effective practices is emphasized in a review of effective instructional practices and effective social skills instruction. Finally, six issues are recommended for future consideration before the adoption and implementation of widespread integration, including: integration cannot be viewed as a cost-saving measure, support services must be considered an integral part of any integration model, and Canadian teacher training programs should require all teachers in training to take special education courses. Appendixes provide additional information on the Cascade Service Delivery Model, the Modified Cascade Model, the Adaptive Learning Environment Model, the Integrated Classroom Model, and the Collaborative/Consultative Model.

AB  - Background: In this study, a literature review was conducted to analyze studies published from 1990 to 2014 in English-written literature on inclusion of children with developmental disabilities in Arab countries. Aims: This study sought to review and analyze research conducted on Inclusive Education (IE) in Arab countries. Methods and procedures: The following electronic databases were used in searching the relevant literature: ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, PsychINFO, EBSCOhost Databases, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database, ERIC, and Google Scholar. After the publications to be included in this study were retrieved, each study was reviewed and analyzed. Each study was examined for details such as authors, title of research, publication year, country, purpose, methods, and key findings. Outcomes and results: The results showed that a total of 42 empirical studies related to inclusion of children with developmental disabilities in Arab countries have been published. More than two-thirds of these studies came from United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The majority of the studies were published in the last 6 years. The main parameters in these studies were: attitudes toward inclusion, barriers to inclusion, and evaluating inclusion. Conclusions and implications: The results of the current study revealed that relatively little IE research has been conducted in Arab countries. More research is warranted to test the generalizability of the results of the current study. Further research is also needed to analyze IE practices and demonstrate strategies for the effective implementation of IE in these countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inclusive education of students with disabilities in general education contexts has been a global movement for at least 30 years. We completed a systematic review of articles published in English- and Spanish-language peer-reviewed journals to obtain an international perspective on the status of inclusive education research and practice regarding students with disabilities, as reflected in the literature from 2002 through 2016. Our literature search, which involved two parallel searches to compare and contrast articles published in the English and Spanish professional literature, yielded 2380 articles which were categorised into seven categories: theory, descriptive, attitudinal, literature review, intervention, and non-inclusive. For both the English and Spanish literature, the most two common article types were theory and descriptive. The number of intervention articles, with findings on the efficacy of interventions to promote inclusive practices, was drastically lower in the Spanish literature. Implications for advancing future research and practice are discussed.

AB  - The seven articles included here cover a wide range of communication issues, all supporting the notion that communication is everyone's responsibility. First article demonstrates that research on the efficacy of training is valuable not only for increasing the knowledge base and for presenting positive results, but also for identifying why some communication training programs fail to achieve the desired outcome of improved communicative interactions. Next article demonstrates how staff judgments about a student's competence can have a dramatic impact on school inclusion. Next article reports on an integrated program aimed at developing the communication and literacy skills of four children who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). In the final article in this collection, the authors ask a group of older adults with cerebral palsy to talk about their experiences of loneliness. Together, the seven papers in this Special Issue on communication identify a number of ways to promote communication access and inclusion for those with complex communication needs and lifelong disability. The contributing authors offer a variety of solutions, as well as intriguing and promising directions for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Educators often assume that the self-concept of children with learning disabilities (LD) is less favorable than that of children without LD. The present study, a meta-analysis of 61 studies of self-concept, was conducted to examine this assumption. Results showed that children with LD perceived their academic ability less favorably than their non-LD peers. In other domains of self-concept, however, group differences were less clear. In contrast to a previous meta-analysis (Chapman, 1988), the results of this study indicated no differences in self-concept as a function of special education setting. Implications for research and practice in school psychology are discussed.

AB  - Over the past few decades, an increasing number of schools across the U.S. have adopted inclusive education models in which students with disabilities (SWD) attend classes with their nondisabled peers. This Information Capsule summarizes the research on the academic and social outcomes of inclusion on students with and without disabilities. Most studies have found no significant difference between the academic achievement of SWD in inclusive classrooms and SWD in self-contained special education classrooms; however, no consensus has been reached regarding the impact of inclusion on nondisabled students' academic achievement. Most researchers have concluded that inclusive classrooms have a positive impact on disabled students' social outcomes, but the impact of inclusion on nondisabled students' social outcomes has not yet been determined.

AB  - This Information Capsule reviews the research conducted on outcomes associated with placing students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in inclusive classrooms. Key findings include: (1) studies comparing the academic and social outcomes of students with ASD placed in inclusive versus segregated special education classrooms have produced mixed results; (2) research conducted on the impact of inclusive classrooms on nondisabled students' academic and social outcomes has produced inconsistent findings; (3) inclusion works for some but not all students with ASD; (4) physical integration of students with ASD and nondisabled students in inclusive classrooms alone may not be enough to produce positive outcomes; and (5) the biggest challenge is providing teachers with enough training and support.

AB  - This paper provides a summary of findings from a series of independent studies that have been undertaken separately. The studies used a specific developmental test battery -- the Institute for Neuro-Physiological Psychology (INPP) Developmental Test Battery for use in schools with children with special educational needs -- with a total of 810 children, the object being to assess whether neurological dysfunction was a significant factor underlying academic achievement. All children were tested using the INPP Developmental Test Battery together with additional standard educational measures to assess drawing & reading at the beginning & end of the program. The progress of 339 children aged four to five years of age was tracked through the school year to see whether children with higher scores on the INPP Developmental Test Battery (indications of neurological dysfunction) performed less well academically at the end of the school year. A smaller number of children in mainstream classes (235 children) aged 8-10 years undertook a specific program of developmental exercises (The INPP Schools' Developmental Exercise Program) for 10 minutes a day under teacher supervision over the course of one academic year. Two hundred & five children aged 8-10 years also underwent the INPP Tests but did not take part in the Developmental Exercise Program. The third group acted as a control group. No pre-selection was made among these groups at the beginning of the study. One study included a fourth group of 31 children who were given non-specific exercises for the same time period each day as the experimental group (INPP exercises) to see whether general daily exercises were more or less effective than the specific INPP exercises. Children in this study were seven to nine years of age. The results showed that the children who participated in the daily INPP exercises made significantly greater improvement on measures for neurological dysfunction, balance & coordination. Children who had scores of more than 25% on tests for neurological dysfunction & whose reading age was less than their chronological age at the outset also showed small but significantly greater progress in reading than children who did not take part in the program.

AB  - Social participation of students with special educational needs (SEN) is a key issue in the inclusion debate. However, the meaning of concepts like social integration, social inclusion and social participation used in current literature is often unclear. Recently, these concepts were clarified based on preschool and primary school literature. The current study assesses the meaning of these concepts for secondary school samples and possible differences with preschool and primary school. A literature review on secondary school literature, including 19 articles, revealed large parallels, i.e. the three concepts can be used as synonyms and include the same key themes: relationships, interactions, perception of the pupil with SEN and acceptance by classmates. Although the subthemes within the key themes largely concurred, one subtheme (i.e. self-perception of social interaction) was added and three subthemes, mentioned in the scheme based on preschool and primary school, were not found.

AB  - A significant proportion of Canada's school-age population requires special educational provisions. Statistics Canada reports that 4.6% of 5- to 14-year-olds had some kind of disability in 2006. As well, recent data from the British Columbia and Ontario ministries of education indicate that students with designated special educational needs comprise close to 9% of the primary and secondary school population. Educational placements among this population pose controversial questions: are students with disabilities better served in "inclusive" settings with mainstream peers, or "separate" settings with similarly challenged peers, where specialized attention is arguably easier to provide? Despite a move toward inclusion being the most significant trend across Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, and widespread belief in the social and emotional advantages of inclusion, the academic consequences of educating students with special needs in inclusive rather than separate settings remain contested. Often, proponents of separate settings do not disagree with inclusion in principle, but believe, in practice, adequate support services cannot be offered in inclusive settings. Others appear to believe the conditions for successful inclusion are achievable, but not currently in place. The Canadian Council on Learning recently completed a systematic review of the literature comparing the academic outcomes of students with special educational needs (SEN) in inclusive settings with their counterparts in separate settings. This review was designed to investigate claims that inclusive settings are more or less beneficial than separate ones. (Contains 4 figures.)

AB  - Research indicates that peer interaction can have a substantial impact on the lives of adolescents with disabilities. However, social interaction among adolescents with intellectual disabilities and their general education peers typically occurs infrequently in secondary schools. This paper provides a critical analysis of twenty-six empirical interventions aimed at promoting social interaction among adolescents with intellectual disabilities and their general education peers in middle and high school settings. Findings are analyzed with regard to intervention components; student characteristics; interaction settings; measures of interaction; observation procedures; experimental designs; intervention components; and measures of generalization, social validity, and treatment integrity. Based upon findings from this literature, we present recommendations to guide future research and the development of effective social interaction interventions for adolescents with intellectual disabilities in middle and high schools.

AB  - There is increasing interest in the use of technology in supporting individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This review examined single-case studies investigating the use of technology to support self-management interventions for individuals with ASD. The studies were assessed against the What Works Clearinghouse standards (Institute of Education Sciences 2014) for methodological rigor. Twelve studies met inclusion criteria, and treatment effects were calculated using the percentage of non-overlapping data (Scruggs et al. Remedial and Special Education, 8(2), 24-33, 1987). Results showed that the use of technology to support self-management interventions is effective for individuals with ASD. Furthermore, this review highlights a need for more rigorous studies to ascertain the efficacy of the use of technology to support self-management for individuals with ASD outside school settings.

AB  - For decades now, as the issue of social progress has come to the fore, the drive to improve access to education has been behind the growth in research into e-learning. The current systematic literature review raised the question of the existence of studies addressing the specific needs of persons with cognitive impairments. Indeed, e-learning is expected to be one of the critical tools for improving access to education and ultimately aiding social inclusion. The systematic literature review was performed through a four-step process including an exhaustive search of scientific literature databases, the selection of studies through exclusion and inclusion criteria, and literature analysis and synthesis. The main results are: 1) a lack of e-learning studies addressing the issue of accessibility for people with cognitive impairments (N = 29) with a purpose dominated by design guidelines rather than effectiveness assessment; 2) a weak inclusion of accessibility standards (N = 5) and 3) a weak inclusion of special education findings (N = 3), with a focus on specific neuropsychological disorders or syndromes (dyslexia, ADHD, etc.) rather than on impairments of cognitive function (attention, memory, etc.) as promoted by the International Classification of Functioning (World Health Organization, 2001); 4) the identification of five families of accessibility function (adaptive systems, game elements, accessible content, virtual agents and accessible interfaces or environments) and their dependency with activity-domain of learning. Results are discussed in terms of both design and assessment recommendations, promoting a multi-disciplinary approach combining educational sciences, cognitive sciences and computer science to develop more accessible e-learning systems.

AB  - Introduction: Self-determination is a highly valued but under-researched component of the expanded core curriculum for students with visual impairments. In this study, the authors present results of a literature review on self-determination for children and youths with visual impairments (i.e., those who are blind or have low vision). Method: Self-determination studies were identified through searches of electronic databases for articles published from 2003 to 2016. Two researchers reviewed the articles and rated them in terms of quality indicators for research in special education. Results: Eleven articles, using correlational, qualitative, group experimental or quasi-experimental, and single-case research designs, met inclusion criteria for this literature review. Adherence to the quality indicators varied from 33% to 100%. Discussion: Students with visual impairments need age-appropriate opportunities to develop self-determination skills in school, home, and community settings. Short-term, focused programs and interventions may be promising methods for teaching self-determination skills; however, more research needs to be conducted to establish evidence-based practices in this area. Implications for practitioners: Practitioners can facilitate development of self-determination skills by supporting students in making decisions affecting their lives, encouraging involvement of students in the education and transition planning processes, and promoting self-advocacy.

AB  - This literature review will address issues to consider related to teaching numeracy and mathematics to children with disabilities in inclusive early childhood classrooms. As inclusive settings and instruction in numeracy/mathematics at an early age become more common, it is important to closely examine teaching strategies and make appropriate adaptations for young children with special needs. The purpose of this paper is to examine (a) strategies for embedding opportunities for numeracy/math development across various learning centers in a preschool classroom, and (b) instructional strategies that may be effective when teaching math and/or numeracy skills to children with special needs in inclusive early childhood settings.

AB  - Teachers are seen as key persons to implement inclusive education. Positive attitudes are therefore argued as playing a considerable role in implementing this educational change successfully. The aim of this study is to examine what attitudes teachers hold towards inclusive education, which variables are related to their attitudes and if these affect the social participation of pupils with special needs in regular schools. A review of 26 studies revealed that the majority of teachers hold neutral or negative attitudes towards the inclusion of pupils with special needs in regular primary education. No studies reported clear positive results. Several variables are found which relate to teachers' attitudes, such as training, experience with inclusive education and pupils' type of disability. No conclusion could be drawn regarding the effects of teachers' attitudes on the social participation of pupils with special needs. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - This article reviews research on the effectiveness of four categories of intervention when implemented in public schools with adolescents and young adults diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. The study's inclusionary criteria include a setting of public schools, participants aged between 12 and 22 years, and the investigation of an antecedent-, consequence-, self-management-, or video-based intervention strategy to influence skills or behaviors in students. A total of 34 studies met these criteria. The procedures of the What Works Clearinghouse Standards for Single-Case Designs and Evidence are used to evaluate whether sufficient high-quality research in using antecedent-, consequence-, self-management-, and video-based strategies exists to consider these evidence-based practices. Intervention effectiveness is estimated using PAND scores and phi coefficients. The results suggest that sufficient research exists to consider antecedent-, video-, and consequence-based interventions evidence-based practices for adolescents and young adults in public schools. The need for more applied research with adolescents and young adults is highlighted.

AB  - A pilot project to apply the methods of systematic review was carried out at the National Foundation for Educational Research. The subject of the review was 'Strategies to Support Pupils with Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties (EBD) in Mainstream Primary Classrooms'. The present article describes the process of the review, the adaptations of the 'medical model' to educational settings and discusses some of the implications of these for researchers and policy-makers. The purpose of the review was to describe and explain current knowledge about effective classroom practice related to EBD in order to guide professional practice. The audience for the review was assumed to be primary classroom teachers, special educational needs coordinators, heads and deputies, advisers and educational psychologists. The EBD review provided a number of key learning points: (1) that such reviews should be given the status and time allocation of a significant research project; (2) that the review should focus on a specific question, and have clearly defined criteria for including and excluding studies; and (3) that it is important to have clear criteria for assessing the methodological quality of the studies.

AB  - Conducting and supporting scientifically valid research activities and implementing evidence-based practices have driven recent hopes and efforts to achieve better outcomes for all students. In the context of ongoing internal review and continuous improvement, we were interested in how this evolution was reflected in empirical studies published in The Journal of Special Education (JSE). We coded key variables related to evidence-based research in articles published between 2004 and 2017. We found that most studies included elementary- or secondary-aged students with disabilities in general or special education classroom settings with teachers or researchers assessing the benefits of academic skill training interventions using single-case designs. We discuss implications for ongoing internal reviews and assessments as well as for comparisons, benchmarking, and evaluations within the field.

AB  - Inclusive education of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) has become a global trend. However, a considerable number of studies have shown that mere enrolment in mainstream classrooms is not enough to support the social participation of pupils with SEN. These children are at risk of experiencing difficulties in their involvement with peers at school. Thus, the question arises of how social participation can be fostered in mainstream classrooms. A systematic review of 35 studies was conducted to investigate which interventions are effective in inclusive mainstream preschool and elementary classrooms. Teaching interaction strategies to typically developing pupils, group activities in the academic context (cooperative learning and peer-tutoring), support groups for pupils with SEN, and training paraprofessionals to facilitate social interactions, were found to improve the social participation of pupils with SEN in general education classrooms. Nevertheless, there is need for more intervention studies implementing a variety of strategies and including different groups of pupils with SEN. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) have traditionally been educated in self-contained special education settings. Recent legislative changes such as the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 2004 have led to increased inclusion of students with EBD in general education classrooms. Because of these changes, general educators need to know which research-based interventions are effective in improving academic performance with these students. This systematic review examined the literature to identify research-based effective interventions for students with EBD served in general education settings. Studies included in this review had to meet the following criteria: research sample includes students identified with EBD as their primary disability who are being educated full time in general education settings; description of intervention and implementation are thorough enough to allow replication; documented relationship between intervention and academic performance is clearly established; and data documenting intervention effect is provided. The focus of interventions for students with EBD is too often only on controlling behavior, whereas this review focused on improving academics. Studies not meeting these criteria were excluded from the review. These inclusion and exclusion criteria were necessary to identify studies relevant to current practice of inclusion, as well as to provide information to educators on interventions having an effect on academic performance. Five studies met all inclusion criteria. Effective interventions included: writing instruction, discovery teaching, teacher modeling, cross-age tutoring, and guided notes. Nineteen studies met all inclusion criteria except setting, with intervention and data collection performed in self-contained special education classrooms. These studies suggest that peer-tutoring and self-management interventions may also be effective if introduced into general education classrooms. The study concludes by suggesting specific methodological criteria needed for future research in this area.

AB  - Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) have traditionally been educated in self-contained special education settings. Recent legislative changes such as the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 2004 have led to increased inclusion of students with EBD in general education classrooms. Because of these changes, general educators need to know which research-based interventions are effective in improving academic performance with these students. This systematic review examined the literature to identify research-based effective interventions for students with EBD served in general education settings. Studies included in this review had to meet the following criteria: research sample includes students identified with EBD as their primary disability who are being educated full time in general education settings; description of intervention and implementation are thorough enough to allow replication; documented relationship between intervention and academic performance is clearly established; and data documenting intervention effect is provided. The focus of interventions for students with EBD is too often only on controlling behavior, whereas this review focused on improving academics. Studies not meeting these criteria were excluded from the review. These inclusion and exclusion criteria were necessary to identify studies relevant to current practice of inclusion, as well as to provide information to educators on interventions having an effect on academic performance. Five studies met all inclusion criteria. Effective interventions included: writing instruction, discovery teaching, teacher modeling, cross-age tutoring, and guided notes. Nineteen studies met all inclusion criteria except setting, with intervention and data collection performed in self-contained special education classrooms. These studies suggest that peer-tutoring and self-management interventions may also be effective if introduced into general education classrooms. The study concludes by suggesting specific methodological criteria needed for future research in this area. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The inclusion of students with disabilities in the general education classroom is one of the most debated subjects in the field of education today. A review of the literature revealed that while inclusion has been shown to benefit children who receive special education services alongside their non-disabled peers, there are a number of barriers that prevent the practice and procedure of inclusion from being successfully implemented. Lack of teacher training, ineffective instruction, and overall teacher attitudes have been identified as the most prominent barriers to the inclusion process and suggestions for future study indicate that more information to determine the extent to which disabled children are academically, socially and emotionally impacted by those barriers.

AB  - The present study compares different measures of social inclusion of children with special educational needs (SEN). We review common measures for social inclusion and hypothesize that the type of measure of social inclusion has a significant impact on the relationship between SEN and social inclusion. Further, we assume that more diverse classrooms are related to higher social acceptance. We elicited social networks of 439 primary school children in integrative classrooms with structured interviews. Results showed that differences in social inclusion between children with low, moderate and high SEN and students without SEN depended on the type of measure. We conclude that the measurement of social inclusion should capture a holistic view of a child's social relationships. In addition, contextual conditions of the classroom should be considered such that the focus of the evaluation is not whether a child fits into a classroom, but whether the classroom is accommodating the child.

AB  - Educational policies mandate the consideration of accommodations so that students with disabilities become proficient in the objectives outlined by state academic content standards and demonstrate proficiency on high-stakes assessments. However, neither policies nor empirical research provide sufficient guidance for educators to effectively select and implement accommodations. This study reviews the effectiveness of accommodations for students in the special education eligibility category of emotional disturbance and those with diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). First, we propose definitions that delineate accommodations from modifications and interventions. Next, we identify strategies that could serve as potential accommodations for this population. Next, we conduct a systematic literature review and calculate effect sizes to evaluate the effectiveness of the included strategies. Finally, we review the evidence to determine whether each included strategy meets the proposed definition of an accommodation. Although several potential strategies are beneficial to youth with ADHD and/or emotional and behavioral disorders, this review indicates that very few purported accommodations actually meet all the criteria in the definition of accommodations, and there is very little evidence supporting the effectiveness of commonly recommended accommodations for youth with behavioral challenges. Our critique of the state of the science on accommodations highlights several important issues that can be used to inform current research and practice in schools.

AB  - Students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) experience symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that often manifest as academic impairment. As such, teachers must select interventions to increase the probability of success for students with ADHD in their classes. Prior meta-analyses have evaluated school-based intervention effects; however, no systematic review meta-analysis has evaluated the effectiveness of interventions implemented in classrooms with students with ADHD. Additionally, classroom-based studies are frequently conducted through single-case design methodology, and recent advances in meta-analytic techniques provide the opportunity to explore intervention effectiveness as evaluated through quality research. Therefore, to inform selection of evidence-based interventions to be implemented in classroom settings, the current systematic review with meta-analysis of single-case design studies was conducted to evaluate intervention effectiveness, evidence-based status, and moderators of effects for four intervention types (behavioral, instructional, self-management, and environmental) when implemented with students with ADHD in classroom settings. The analysis included 27 articles published from 1971 to 2018. Overall and specific to each intervention type, the results indicate that classroom-based interventions for students with ADHD were moderately effective. Instructional and self-management interventions were deemed evidence based by What Works Clearinghouse standards and potentially evidence based by Council for Exceptional Children standards. Behavioral interventions were found to be potentially evidence based by Council for Exceptional Children criteria and were most effective when selected through functional behavior analysis and implemented by researchers in secondary settings. Instructional interventions were more effective when implemented in special education settings targeting academic outcomes. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - What do we know about young children with delays and disabilities, and how can we help them succeed in prekindergarten through third grade? To begin with, Kathleen Hebbeler and Donna Spiker write, identifying children with delays and disabilities to receive specialized services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act poses several challenges. First, even though eligibility is based on 14 disability categories listed in the law, each state determines its own criteria for those conditions. Second, young children-especially those with disabilities-are hard to assess. Third, deciding where to draw the line for eligibility along a continuum of functioning is a matter of policy rather than science. In recent decades, the authors note, the concept of disability has been moving away from a medical model that sees disability as an impairment that resides in the child and toward a framework that emphasizes children's functioning and interaction with their environments. The authors review effective ways to support development and learning among young children with disabilities, including language and social skills interventions, preschool curricula, instructional and other practices, and multi-tiered systems of support. Then they examine a critical policy issue: the inclusion of young children with disabilities in regular education classrooms. One critical finding is that high-quality instruction in general education classrooms is a major factor in good educational outcomes for children with disabilities, and for their successful inclusion from preschool to third grade. Moreover, improving the quality of general education benefits all children, not just those with disabilities. Hebbeler and Spiker also examine what we know about the transitions young children with disabilities make from one setting to another-for example, from prekindergarten to kindergarten. Here they conclude that we need far more research if we're to understand what makes such transitions successful.

AB  - The practice of inclusion is not a new idea to the educational setting; it is a newer term. Before No Child Left Behind, during the 1970s students with disabilities were mainstreamed into the general education population under Public Law 94-142. Public law 94-142, which was renamed to Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act (IDEA), required students with disabilities to be educated with their non-disabled peers as much as possible. Additionally, IDEA requires that a continuum of placement options be available to meet the needs of students with disabilities. This has not changed with the reauthorization of IDEA 2004, however now students with disabilities must be included in statewide assessment. With this addition to the law, schools are paying more attention to their students with disability populations, thus the emergence of full inclusion. The rationale for inclusion has never rested on research findings alone, but on principle (Hines 2001). Proponents insist that the integration of students with disabilities are inherently right, compared often to the same right to racial integration (Hines, 2001). The primary focus of this article is to review the research on the educational benefits of the inclusive model of education for students with disabilities. The term inclusion or responsible inclusion is a term used to identify the movement to provide service to students with disabilities in the general education setting. Inclusion is usually considered the least restrictive environment for students with disabilities. In this article I will discuss the history of special education, the different services options for educating students with disabilities and the benefits associated with inclusion, as well as the opposing arguments for inclusion.

AB  - Most of the Southeast Asian region is comprised of developing countries. This region has a short history of inclusive education implementation and differs from developed countries' more mature inclusive education systems. This review reveals how inclusive schooling has been implemented in Southeast Asian countries and the current practices in the region. We used scoping review methodology to examine peer-reviewed literature published between January 1994 and January 2017 on inclusive schooling in the Southeast Asian countries. The inputs-processes-outcomes (IPO) model was used to group and describe the extant research. Thirty-eight articles were identified that contributed to region of Southeast Asia inclusive education research. The majority (n = 29, 76%) were published after 2010. The articles were organised by IPO stage: Inputs stage (staff professional and teacher education, resources and finances, leadership, curriculum and policy); Processes stage (collaboration and shared responsibility, school practice, classroom practice and climate) and Outcomes stage (participation). The elements of staff professional and teacher education, and collaboration and shared responsibility were most frequently featured in the literature of the inputs and processes stages. Research information about the outcomes stage of inclusive schooling was sparse. The inclusive education literature from the region is still emerging. A greater focus on outcomes is recommended in future research and practice. Having outcome data will enable evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of inclusive education. If evaluation reveals problems, then aspects of the inputs and processes stages may need to be improved to achieve better outcomes.

AB  - Successful transition from primary to secondary school is important for psychosocial well-being. Children with special educational needs (SEN) may face additional complexities at transition, although the impact of this process on children‚Äôs psychosocial adjustment has been underexplored. The article aims to review systematically the literature exploring the impact of transition on the concerns and psychosocial adjustment of children with SEN in comparison to typically developing children. Published studies were identified through a systematic search of six electronic databases. Articles fulfilling inclusion criteria were reviewed and a quality criteria system was developed to rank studies. Children with specific learning difficulties perceive lower levels of social support and more peer victimisation after transition than typically developing children, but methodological limitations and the modest number of studies restricted the conclusions that could be drawn.

AB  - Students with disabilities have traditionally achieved to a lesser degree than have their nondisabled peers. Since the 1950s the federal government has enacted laws to provide free, appropriate public education to students with disabilities. In the first decade of the 21st; Century the government has produced legislation requiring schools to be responsible for improving instruction for students with disabilities. One of the major trends in accomplishing this task is a move toward inclusive education. This study determined the relationships of assessment type (Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments versus Virginia Grade Level Alternative (VGLA) assessments) and models of service delivery (general education inclusion classes versus special education pullout classes) for students with disabilities in grades 3 through 8 on student achievement in 4 counties in Southwest Virginia. Similar studies have been conducted with varying results noted. The review of the literature includes 18 studies that compared the achievement of students with disabilities who were instructed in the general education classroom with the achievement of students with disabilities who were instructed in the special education classroom. Significant differences were noted in 11 of the reviewed studies. The data were analyzed using chi-square analysis and pairwise comparisons. The findings indicate that there is a relationship between instructional delivery method (inclusion or pullout) and proficiency in reading and math. Students who were educated in the inclusion classrooms tended to have a higher incidence of pass proficient ratings and students in the pullout classrooms tended to have a higher incidence of pass advanced ratings. The findings also indicate that there is a relationship between assessment method (SOL assessment or VGLA) and proficiency in reading and math. Students who were assessed via the SOL assessment tended to have a higher incidence of pass proficient ratings and students who were assessed via the VGLA assessment tended to have a higher incidence of pass advanced ratings.

AB  - One strategy for improving teacher preparation programs for teaching Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is to enhance the coursework offered at colleges and universities at the undergraduate level. The goal is to better equip college programs to provide effective and substantial preparation for teacher candidate to effectively instruction ASD students. Programs offered by colleges and universities to prepare new special education teachers with the appropriate skills is multi-faceted. First, a clearly defined curriculum or coursework design is required. Secondly, an extended student teaching schedule is needed for an authentic and practical application experience. Finally, offering a monetary incentive for special educators to become certified in autism, after successfully completing additional coursework, is needed. This paper reviews evidence on the effectiveness of teacher preparation programs to prepare special educators to teach students with ASD. Despite the limited research on this topic, the future of students with ASD relies on the instruction highly prepared and competent teachers specifically trained to support their needs. Otherwise, the cost to school district and K-12 education will rise significantly to prepare students with ASD for life-skills, college, or career readiness.

AB  - The reason for this article is a concern about the future of children with disabilities. In Denmark, there has been very little research in the effects of different types of special education. However, some studies show that children who at-tend special schools have poorer prospects than children who are included in mainstream schools. In this article, I try to answer the question: Do special schools provide their students with skills required to handle life outside of special schools? Through a review of international research on the effects of special education, I find that there is still need for more research in the variables that influence the prospects of children with disabilities. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) Et flertal i Folketinget satte i 2012 som m√¢l at 96 % af aile born skulle vcere inkluderet i en almindelig skole i √¢r 2015. Forhenvcerende undervisningsminister Christine Antorini argumenterede bl.a. for inklusion med ordene: 'Hovedparten af bern med scerlige behov f√¢r mere ud afat deltage i den almene undervisning frem for at bliue ekskluderet. For n√¢r bem foler sig som medlemmer af et fcel- lesskab, er der grobund for, at de leerer bedst'(Antorini, 2014). Interessen for at inkludere og forvente mere af bem med scerlige behov skal muligvis ogs√• ses i sammenhoeng med en politisk uvilje mod 'passiv fors√∏rgelse'af borgerne, og ser man fx p√• stramningen af reglerne for tilkendelse af fertidspension, tyder noget p√•, at i fremtiden vil feerre borgere blive fritaget fra at deltage p√§ arbejdsmarke- det. Politikerne synes s√•ledes at have en interesse i at r√ºste alle bem til at blive nyttige samfundsborgere. Flytningen afbern fra specialskoler til almenskoler er ikke et nyt feenomen i dansk skolehistorie. 11970‚Äôeme og 80‚Äô erne ville man integrere bern med s√¶rlige behov og give alle bem ret til den samme undervisning. Men efterfelgende er udviklingen i mange √•r g√•et den modsatte vej, og stadig flere bem er blevet udskilt til specialundervisning. Sp√∏rgsm√•let er, hvad √•rene med skiftevis inklusion og eksklusion har medfert af viden om faktorer i skole- gangen, som p√§virker bern med scerlige behov. Er der fx evidens for, at bernene f√•r bedre fremtidsudsigter, n√•r de er blevet undervist i et specialiseret tilbud? Jeg vil her undersege og diskutere dansk forskning i specialundervisningens ef- fekter og sammenholde den med udvalgt international forskningp√• to omr√•der: 1. Undervisningstilbuddets betydningfor bemenes fremtidsudsigter. 2. Betydningen afden professionelles tilgang og forventninger til b√∏rnene. Undervisningstilbuddets betydning unders√∏ger jeg via danske og internationale reviews, mens betydningen af den professionelles (l≈ìrerens/poeda-gogens) tilgang til barnet belyses ved hjeelp af teorier omkring begrebet self-determination.

AB  - Background: Over the past 20 years or so policy and practice on the education of children with special educational needs (SEN) has been aimed at placing increasing numbers of children in a mainstream school environment. Although this policy has been supported in principle by many teachers, parents and local authority officers, there has been much less agreement about whether this principle can be realized in practice, and even if it can, about what the impacts might be on the achievements of pupils with SEN in mainstream schools and, in particular, on their peers. Purpose: This paper discusses the key findings from a systematic review of the literature carried out by the Inclusion Review Group, on behalf of the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information (EPPI)-Centre, the purpose of which was to review research evidence on whether the placement of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) within mainstream schools has an impact on academic and social outcomes for pupils "without" SEN. Design and methods: The methodology followed the procedures adopted by the EPPI-Centre. Having agreed on the inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies that could be included in the review, an initial pool of 7137 papers were identified through electronic databases. After having screened all their titles and/or abstracts and having marked out possible papers to be included in the review, 119 paper copies were obtained--all of which were read by one or more of the authors of this paper. This led to a further reduction to 26 studies that were subjected to the EPPI data extraction process and synthesis. Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggest that there are no adverse effects on pupils without SEN of including pupils with special needs in mainstream schools, with 81% of the outcomes reporting positive or neutral effects. Despite concerns about the quality of some of the studies that were reviewed and the fact that the great majority were carried out in the USA, these findings should bring some comfort to headteachers, parents and local authority officers around the world at a time when concerns have been raised about the problems that schools face in responding to the twin agenda of becoming more inclusive and, at the same time, raising the achievements of all their pupils.

AB  - Purpose of review: To inform readers of current issues in special education for individuals with intellectual disabilities and summarize recent research and opinion. Recent findings: Two issues dominate special education for students with intellectual disabilities in the early 21st century. First, what should be taught to such students and who should teach them? Second, where should such students be taught ‚Äì in ‚Äòinclusive‚Äô settings alongside normal peers or in special settings dedicated to their special needs? Research on teaching reading, arithmetic, and functional daily living skills to students with disabilities suggests the superiority of direct, systematic instruction. Universal design is often seen as supportive of inclusion. Inclusion has been seen as the central issue in special education but is gradually giving way to concern for what students learn. Summary: Direct, systematic instruction in reading, arithmetic, and daily living skills is the most effective approach to teaching students with intellectual disabilities. Basic concepts and logic suggest that special and general education cannot be equivalent. We conclude that what students are taught should be put ahead of where they are taught. Our fundamental concern is that students with intellectual disabilities be respected and be taught all they can learn. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Inclusive education/mainstreaming is a key policy objective for the education of children and young people with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities. Aims: This paper reviews the literature on the effectiveness of inclusive education/mainstreaming. The focus is on evidence for effects in terms of child outcomes with examination also of evidence on processes that support effectiveness. Samples: The review covers a range of SEN and children from pre-school to the end of compulsory education. Method: Following an historical review of evidence on inclusive education/mainstreaming, the core of the paper is a detailed examination of all the papers published in eight journals from the field of special education published 2001-2005 (N=1373): Journal of Special Education, Exceptional Children, Learning Disabilities Research and Practice, Journal of Learning Disabilities, Remedial and Special Education, British Journal of Special Education, European Journal of Special Needs Education, and the International Journal of Inclusive Education. The derived categories were: comparative studies of outcomes: other outcome studies; non-comparative qualitative studies including non-experimental case studies; teacher practice and development; teacher attitudes; and the use of teaching assistants. Results: Only 14 papers (1.0%) were identified as comparative outcome studies of children with some form of SEN. Measures used varied but included social as well as educational outcomes. Other papers included qualitative studies of inclusive practice, some of which used a non-comparative case study design while others were based on respondent's judgements, or explored process factors including teacher attitudes and the use of teaching assistants. Conclusions: Inclusive education/mainstreaming has been promoted on two bases: the rights of children to be included in mainstream education and the proposition that inclusive education is more effective. This review focuses on the latter issue. The evidence from this review does not provide a clear endorsement for the positive effects of inclusion. There is a lack of evidence from appropriate studies and, where evidence does exist, the balance was only marginally positive. It is argued that the policy has been driven by a concern for children's rights. The important task now is to research more thoroughly the mediators and moderators that support the optimal education for children with SEN and disabilities and, as a consequence, develop an evidence-based approach to these children's education.

AB  - The paper reviews research on the effects of placement in full-time special education classes, part-time regular classes with resource support, and full-time regular classes on mildly handicapped students. Also examined are programs designed to improve achievement, social-emotional adjustment, and social acceptance of the academically handicapped by their nonhandicapped peers. Studies of placements indicate no consistent benefits of full-time special education on any major outcomes; the research tends to favor full- or part-time regular class placement over full-time special education for the achievement, self-esteem, behavior, and emotional adjustment of the academically handicapped. Differences between full-time regular class placement and part-time regular class placement with resource help tend to favor well-constructed part-time programs for achievement, but not for social-emotional outcomes. Research indicates that cooperative learning programs and individualized instruction programs can improve the self-perceptions and behavior of mainsteamed academically handicapped students and acceptance by their nonhandicapped classmates.

AB  - Background: Research on the self-concept of youth with intellectual disabilities has not been summarized in more than four decades. The present systematic review addresses this gap. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in nine databases and 21 studies, published between 1979 and 2017, met our inclusion criteria. Results: Significant differences between the self-concepts of youth with intellectual disabilities and typically developing (TD) youth were found in: (a) cognitive-academic self-concept in disfavour of youth with intellectual disabilities; (b) global self-concept and cognitive-academic self-concept in disfavour of children with intellectual disabilities; and (c) global, behavioural, and cognitive-academic self-concept in disfavour of youth with intellectual disabilities schooled in a special class. Additionally, except for age, intellectual functioning and school placement, no significant relations were found between the self-concept dimensions and academic achievement and sex. Conclusion: Studies on self-concept research with school-aged youth with intellectual disabilities have several weaknesses that need to be advanced in future research.

AB  - In the 1980s, recommended practice for high school students with intellectual and developmental disabilities focused on providing educational experiences that would directly prepare them for successful community living (Brown et al, 1979; Wilcox & Bellamy, 1982). Curricula focused on teaching employment, personal management, and leisure activities that reflected the expectations of adulthood (Ford et al, 1989; Neel & Billingsley, 1989; Wilcox & Bellamy, 1987). Teachers were encouraged to move instruction out of the classroom and into community settings in order to ensure that students developed the skills necessary to obtain paid jobs, use the resources of the community, and live independently prior to graduation (Horner, McDonnell, & Bellamy, 1986; Sailor et al, 1987). Although community-based curriculum and instruction are still critical elements of secondary programs, there is a growing agreement that students also benefit educationally and socially from participating in the general high school curriculum and in content-area classes (Fisher, Sax, & Pumpian, 1999; Wehmeyer & Sailor, 2004). There is clear empirical evidence that shows that inclusive educational programs are as effective, if not more effective, than segregated alternatives on a number of measures for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (Hunt & McDonnell, 2007). In addition, research suggests that students who participate in general education classes have better postschool adjustment than peers who do not have these opportunities (Baker, Wang, & Walberg, 1994-1995; Benz, Lindstrom, & Yovanoff, 2000; Phelps & Hanley-Maxwell, 1997; Salend & Garrick-Duhaney, 1999). In spite of the positive impacts of inclusive education, meeting the unique educational needs of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities in typical high school classes remains a challenge for teachers and administrators (Harrower, 1999; McDonnell, 1998). Fortunately, research on strategies for supporting students' participation in the instructional activities and social networks of general education classes has increased significantly over the last decade (Hunt & McDonnell, 2007; Snell, 2007). This chapter will summarize the research on how to effectively support students in the general education curriculum and content-area classes. In addition, the recommended steps for designing effective inclusive educational programs for students will be presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The objective of this review is to find out what knowledge is available regarding the effects of integrating pupils the sensory, motor and/or mental disabilities is regular schools. This review is restricted to the effects of integration on the development of social contacts with classmates without disabilities. Analysis of 14 studies revealed contradictory conclusions: no effects were reported in some studies, while in others researchers found that special needs pupils in regular schools acquired more social contacts and friendships, and that regular and special schools differed in this respect. Only a few studies revealed negative effects of integration.

AB  - What does the take-up of new technology have in common with the adoption of inclusive pedagogies to support students with additional needs in regular classrooms? Both are profound changes in the way we do things. Both are in response to changes in society. Both are championed by true believers and villainised by those more resistant to change. In this paper I consider why inclusive education has been so difficult to sell within schools, despite empirical evidence that is highly supportive of this practice. I review meta-analyses on the academic outcomes of students with disability in inclusive and segregated environments and discuss why the apparent benefits of this approach are not universally appreciated by Australian classroom teachers. I then compare the adoption of inclusive education with the uptake of innovative technology to develop an appreciation of what may be required for teachers to gain an understanding and commitment towards inclusive education.

AB  - This study involved an investigation of differences between outcome measures of students with disabilities placed in more integrated settings with those of students placed in less integrated settings. A meta-analysis was conducted using the findings from 24 studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 1980 through 2013. Results from the analyses suggest that there were significant differences (p < 0.0001) between placement settings with the majority of students with disabilities in more integrated settings outperforming those in less integrated settings on both academic and social outcome measures. Overall these findings, combined with those from two prior meta-analytic studies, provide evidence spanning over 80 years suggesting separate settings are not as beneficial as are more integrated settings. Implications related to practice and policy, as well as avenues for future study, are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past 30 years successive governments in the UK have endeavoured to make the statutory framework suitable for children with special educational needs (SEN). More recently, efforts have been made to personalise children's learning, making educational experience more innovative and responsive to the diversity of needs in schools. A drive is emerging in health and education to develop and evaluate intervention strategies for children with language impairments (LIs), which is both methodologically challenging and rewarding. The current review demonstrates difficulties encountered with using evidence-based (evidence-related) outcome research involving children with LIs. Many studies have inherent methodological problems such as small sample sizes, ill-matched groups and designs that are difficult to replicate or compare. Such approaches are unlikely to yield significant results, or if they do, it is difficult to devise clear guidance regarding choice of intervention strategies. In the light of these difficulties, theoretical, methodological and practical issues are discussed herein and a model is proposed to assist in enabling interventions to be identified, evaluated in a robust manner, and the results shared with educators. We suggest that the use of a process-driven model ensures a more rigorous approach when undertaking large-scale systematic, evidence-based research into the effective approaches to teaching children not only with LIs but across the field of special needs education.

Those papers analyzed how including scholars with intellectual and developmental disabilities in a typical (instead of special) class might have effects on psychological development, academic and adaptive performances. Results are the following: a typical class fosters a better psychological development (particularly from a social point of view since their inclusion promotes, for example, friendship and social acceptance), higher school performances, better adaptive abilities. The present contribution considers also what characteristic typical class should have to offer an excellent inclusion model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

According to the 6 typical symptoms, we had the 13 kinds of interventions into different classifications. Aimed at each kind of intervention, this paper analyzed and then reviewed its training methods or teaching programs based on whether it has a good intervention effect and has empirical support. In the end we carried on a rough summary about the existence question and the future development direction of autism early intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In many countries, education policies are shifting towards inclusive education. Human rights have always been an important argument for this development, but the effects on students should be an important factor when designing policies. In this review, therefore, literature on the effects of inclusion on both students with and without special educational needs is described. The review covers not only effects on cognitive development, but also socio-emotional effects. In general, the results show neutral to positive effects of inclusive education. The academic achievement of students with and without special educational needs seems to be comparable to non-inclusive classes or even better in inclusive classes. However, there may be some differential effects for high- and low-achieving students without special educational needs. Regarding social effects, children with special educational needs seem to have a less favourable social position than children without special educational needs.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to review, analyze, and critique the pros and cons, the advantages and disadvantages, of inclusion. The methodology consisted in analyzing and comparing research findings on the benefits and costs of inclusion. Federal legislation and regulations on inclusion were examined, analyzed, and discussed. The results showed that inclusion, the practice of integrating students with disabilities in regular, general education classrooms for all or nearly all of the day instead of in special education classrooms, had both advantages and disadvantages. The benefits of inclusion consisted of, in general, reduced cost, the development of greater self-esteem and social skills in students with disabilities, and a greater integration of students with diverse needs. Equity and equality were fostered for all students. The cons or disadvantages of inclusion were that time and attention were diverted from regular and advanced students with a concomitant lowering of standards. The conclusion was that the benefits of inclusion outweigh the costs. Inclusion fostered the goals of education, which are tolerance for diversity, equity, equality, community integration, and achievement for all students. Educators and researchers must focus on ways to ensure that inclusion continues to be fostered and that more effective integration strategies and techniques are developed.

AB  - This editorial provides an overview of the papers presented in this issue of the Journal. In the first article, Scheer, Scholz, Rank, and Donie investigate beliefs and self-efficacy among teacher trainees and student teachers working in inclusive education. based on case descriptions of pupils with different forms of special needs in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. In the second article, Buttner, Pijl, Bijstra, and Van den Bosch acknowledge that teaching students with behavioral problems is a challenge for many teachers in inclusive education. The authors assess educational quality in the teaching of students with behavioral problems. They also examine the things that differentiate effective teachers from less effective teachers. The third contribution by Kaiser and Schulze focuses on an often-neglected group at high risk of exclusion: school absentees. In the fourth article, Schwab, Hessels, Obendrauf, Polanig, and W√∂lflingseder investigate the process of assessment of special educational needs in Styria, Austria. Inclusive education has been introduced in Austrian law already in 1993, and the federal state of Styria has the highest proportion (about 80%) of students with special educational needs. Gebhardt, S√§lzer, Mang, M√ºller, and Prenzel, in the fifth contribution, focus on the school performances of students with special educational needs in Germany. The sixth article by Hintz, Paal, Urton, Krull, Wilbert, and Hennemann evaluates teachers‚Äô perceptions of opportunities and threats concerning inclusive schooling in Germany using a mixed-methods approach. Because Germany is at an early stage of change toward inclusion, it is particularly interesting to know how teachers perceive the change toward inclusion and what their perceptions imply for school practice. The last contribution on the topic by Garotte and Sermier Dessemontet concerns the social participation of students with special needs. Indeed, social inclusion is expected to be fostered by inclusive schooling, but research shows that this is not always the case (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - For children with special educational needs, seeds were sown for the move away from segregated settings to inclusion in mainstream settings following the 1978 Warnock Report. However, the ‚Äòspecial versus mainstream school‚Äô debate was re‚Äêignited in 2005 when Warnock recommended a more significant role for special schools than previously envisaged. Furthermore, an increase in special school placement has been reported, prompting this investigation of the role of special schools in the current climate of inclusion. Literature from Britain, Europe and New Zealand, including research that listens to ‚Äòthe voice of the child‚Äô, which compares experiences of children with special educational needs in special and mainstream schools, is reviewed. The findings give no clear indication that either setting leads to better outcomes. Tensions between the inclusion agenda and standards agenda are highlighted. It is concluded that special schools in reduced numbers are likely to remain a feature of the inclusive education system, with recommendations for the development of special‚Äìmainstream school partnership links. The quality of the setting, regardless of the type of setting, is emphasised, highlighting implications for staff training in special and mainstream schools. Further research comparing outcomes for children educated in different types of provision is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Students with disabilities have more barriers to independent living than other student populations. The current study examines the likelihood of independence for young people with disabilities by extending a model developed by the Heal and Rusch (1995) that used the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) from 1992. The current study employs a probit regression with a likelihood of independence as the dependent variable with 6,562 observations. The principal finding is that if special needs children, regardless of disability, participate more in regular educational settings, the likelihood that they live independently after leaving school increases. The analysis also considers preliminary observations from the follow-up National Longitudinal Transition Study-2, due to be completed in 2010. This article provides a literature review regarding students with special needs, their likelihood of living independently after leaving school, and significant policy changes since the original NLTS data set. It describes the methods used in the present study to understand and analyze the NLTS and NLTS-2 studies. Next, it discusses the results of the statistical analysis. Finally, the article provides a discussion of the results, conclusions, and policy implications for the findings. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - Students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are increasingly educated alongside typically developing peers in regular education environments. These students have impairments that may hinder their success in inclusive school settings and require individualized supports to improve outcomes. The purpose of this meta-analysis and best-evidence synthesis is to examine the characteristics of interventions for students with ASD in inclusive settings, offer quantitative analysis of intervention effects, examine potential moderating variables that influence outcomes, analyze the social validity of these interventions, and provide recommendations for practice and future research. The 28 included studies met the What Works Clearinghouse standards for group design and single-case design research. Studies focused mostly on social communication skills, produced moderate to large effects, and were generally found to be socially valid. Function-based interventions, visual supports, self-monitoring strategies, and peer-mediated interventions resulted in mostly large effects, and teacher delivered interventions produced the largest overall effects. More high-quality studies for students with ASD in inclusive school settings are needed to advance evidence-based practice for this population.

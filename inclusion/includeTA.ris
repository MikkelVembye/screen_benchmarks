AB  - The article presents the data of an empirical study of the features of socialization of primary school children aged 8—11 years with intellectual disabilities enrolled in an inclusive (31 people, including 22 boys and 9 girls) and special education (59 people, including 42 boys and 17 girls). In order to test the hypothesis of the specificity of the processes of socialization in training under different conditions, a diagnosis was carried out using a set of techniques, both test and expert. The analysis of the results of the study of individual components of social competence allows us to state that children studying under the conditions of inclusion, compared with their peers, pupils of correctional schools, are characterized by less pronounced manifestations of social maladaptation and more harmonious family relationships, but there are difficulties in recognizing the emotional state of other people, insufficient ability to adequately navigate in fairly typical life situations, contradictory trends in the formation of self-image, reflecting the negative features of psychosocial development, presumably due to the specificity of social experience. Based on the results obtained, the conclusion is made about the importance of special correctional and developmental work in the education of children with intellectual disabilities in the conditions of inclusion, aimed at creating the conditions necessary for the successful socialization of a child with disabilities. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Представлены данные эмпирического исследования особенностей социа- лизации младших школьников 8—11 лет с интеллектуальными нарушени- ями, обучающихся в условиях инклюзивного (31 человек, 22 мальчика и 9 девочек) и специального образования (59 человек, 42 мальчика и 17 де- вочек). С целью проверки гипотезы о специфичности протекания процес- сов социализации при обучении в различных условиях проведена диагно- стика с применением комплекса методик как тестового, так и экспертного характера. Анализ результатов исследования отдельных компонентов со- циальной компетентности позволяет констатировать, что для обучающихся в условиях инклюзии, по сравнению с их сверстниками, воспитанниками коррекционных школ, характерны менее выраженные проявления соци- альной дезадаптации и более гармоничные внутрисемейные отношения, однако отмечаются трудности в распознавании эмоционального состояния других людей, недостаточная способность адекватно ориентироваться в достаточно типичных жизненных ситуациях, противоречивые тенденции в формировании представления о себе, отражающие негативные особенно- сти психосоциального развития, предположительно обусловленные спец- ифичностью социального опыта. На основании полученных результатов делается вывод о значимости специальной коррекционно-развивающей работы при обучении детей с интеллектуальными нарушениями в условиях инклюзии, направленной на создание условий, необходимых для успешной социализации ребенка с ограниченными возможностями здоровья.

AB  - The present study investigated (1) how social relationships with teachers and peers and self-esteem of students with social–emotional and behavioral difficulties (SEBD) in inclusive regular education (regular schools) and students with SEBD in exclusive special education (special schools) develop over time in comparison with each other and in comparison with their typically developing peers and (2) whether factors—present before students with SEBD received special education services—predicted social–emotional development in either educational setting. Thirty-six students with SEBD in regular schools, 15 students with SEBD in special schools, and 1,270 typically developing peers participated. We collected data when students with SEBD resided in regular education without additional support, and we followed the development of students with SEBD for 1.5 years with three additional measurements in either school setting. Data of typically developing peers were collected when they resided in a classroom of a participating student with SEBD. Using Bayesian statistics, we found that students with SEBD in special schools had more conflictual relationships with their teachers than typically developing peers, but these relationships improved over time. Students with SEBD in regular schools were less accepted among peers than typically developing students and peer acceptance was stable over time for all three groups. Self-esteem and development in self-esteem over time did not differ between groups. The current study shows that students with SEBD show different developmental trajectories in regular or special schools and that it is difficult to predict their social–emotional development by factors present before students with SEBD received special education services.

AB  - The present study tested three conflicting hypotheses as to how students with social/emotional/behavioural difficulties (SEBD), who showed similar social-emotional, behavioural and academic functioning prior to placement, function socially and academically after they have received additional support either in inclusive regular education or in exclusive special education. Thirty-six included and 15 excluded students with SEBD participated. We collected data from students and teachers with classroom surveys, individual testing sessions with students with SEBD, and from application files. Using Bayesian statistics, our results suggest that excluded students are better socially embedded in exclusive special education and that they perform better academically than comparable included students with SEBD. Special education services in exclusive settings may thus afford certain benefits to some students with SEBD, not typically found in regular education, which can be considered a first indication that there may be valid counterarguments against the 'inclusion for all' perspective on educational needs.

AB  - ABSTRACT IN CROATIAN: U clanku se istrazuju mogucnosti primjene ishoda ucenja kao kriterija evaluacije inkluzivne edukacije ucenika s intelektualnim teskocama. Inkluzivna edukacije je specifican pristup ukljucivanju osoba s intelektualnim teskocama u redovno obrazovanja, te se temelji na ljudskim pravima. Ishodi ucenja posljednjih godina postaju vazan instrument obrazovne politike, narocito kao kriterij evaluacije obrazovanja. Analiza mogucnosti primjene ishoda ucenja kao kriterija evaluacije inkluzivne edukacije pokazala je da se poteskoce javljaju zbog nesukladnosti vrijednosne argumentacije inkluzivne edukacije s jedne i argumentacije usmjerene na ishode s druge strane; zbog poteskoca oko mjerenja i usporedbe ishoda ucenja ucenika s intelektualnim teskocama; te nemogucnosti ishoda ucenja da obuhvate socijalne ucinke inkluzivne edukacije. Kao posljedica ovih problema, uslijed primjene ishoda ucenja kao kriterija evaluacije inkluzivne edukacije dolazi do smanjenje resursa namijenjenih provodenju inkluzivne edukacije te se smanjuje ukljucivanje ucenika s intelektualnim teskocama u redovne skole. // ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: The paper investigates the possibilities of the application of learning as a criterion for the evaluation of inclusive education of students with intellectual disabilities. Inclusive education is a specific approach to the inclusion of persons with intellectual disabilities in formal education, and is thus based on human rights. Learning outcomes are recently becoming an important instrument of educational policy, especially as a criterion for education evaluation. The analysis of the possibility to apply learning outcomes as a criterion for the evaluation of inclusive education has shown that difficulties arise as a result of the inconsistency between the value argumentation of inclusive education on one hand, and the argumentation directed towards the outcomes on the other; the difficulties connected with the measurement and comparison of learning outcomes of students with intellectual disabilities; and the infeasibility of learning outcomes to include social effects of inclusive education. Due to these problems, the application of learning outcomes as a criterion of inclusive education leads to the downsizing of resources intended to the implementation of inclusive education, and reduces the inclusion of students with intellectual disabilities in regular schools.

AB  - The study compares the quality of life of pupils with sensory impairment educated in regular and special schools and it reveals the degree of relationships in quality of life domains. The research sample consisted of 84 pupils with visual impairment with average age of 13.57 years old and 60 pupils with hearing impairment age of 13.63 years old. Simple analysis of variance was used in order to compare several groups. The overall quality of life did not reveal differences between the pupils with visual and hearing impairment. Comparison on the quality of life in individual domains revealed a positive improvement in personal development and social inclusion in the pupils with visual impairment educated in special school compared to the integrated pupils. Subjective perception of physical health is better in the individually integrated pupils. The pupils with hearing impairment demonstrate better self-determination if integrated. The pupils with sensory impairment whose degree of impairment is mild are better socially included. The pupils with congenital hearing impairment demonstrate higher emotional well-being compared to the pupils with post-lingual impairment. The pupils with post-lingual impairment have higher overall quality of life compared to the pupils with pre-lingual disability. Using hearing aid proved to be good protector of quality of life of the pupils at special schools.

AB  - Examined how integrated education influences cognitive development of hearing-impaired children in the Slovak Republic. 60 children (aged 7–13 yrs) from integrated education schools (30 Ss) and special schools for hearing-impaired students (30 Ss) were assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). The qualitative analysis indicated that integrated Ss had higher verbal and nonverbal IQ scores compared with Ss from special schools. The results reveal that integrated education, together with professional and family care, school programs, and a friendly environment are substantially beneficial on social and cognitive development of hearing-impaired children.

AB  - Examined the effect of integrated education on the cognitive and personality development of hearing-impaired (HI) children. 30 children (aged 7–13 yrs) with moderate to severe hearing impairment in integrated education and 30 HI children from special schools completed a series of cognitive and personality tests. Results show that HI Ss in integrated education exhibited a higher level of speech competence, were more socially oriented, and showed signs of lower self-consciousness. Non-integrated Ss showed poorer vocabulary and lower performances in tasks that required analysis of life situations, social judgment, and evaluation of social attachments. Findings suggest that integrated education supports cognitive, intellectual, and personality development and differentiation in severely HI children; extracurricular contact with both nondisabled and equally disabled children is also important.

AB  - Increasing numbers of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are attending mainstream schools. Nonetheless, concerns about their emotional well-being and mental health in these settings have also been raised. This study sought to compare caregiver-reported anxiety and other emotional and behavioural problems in youth with ASD attending mainstream or specialist schools. Caregivers of 27 youth with ASD in mainstream schools (age 10.91 +/- 3.44years) and 69 youth with ASD in special schools (age 10.93 +/- 2.81years) matched for gender, age, adaptive functioning and autism symptom severity scores participated. Caregivers completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale-Parent, a measure of adaptive functioning, and a checklist of other emotional and behavioral difficulties. Students with ASD attending mainstream schools experienced higher levels of social anxiety symptoms compared to their specialist school counterparts. No other statistically significant differences were found in other aspects of emotional and behavioural functioning examined, but some differences emerged in item-level analyses. Uncertainties in navigating more complex social environments and increased social relating difficulties in mainstream schools are discussed as probable environmental triggers for increased social phobia related symptomatology, although other explanations for this small effect size difference are also considered. Limitations of the present study and recommendations for future research focusing on exploring environmental socio-ecological factors influencing anxiety and mental health in young people with ASD are also discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this fact sheet is to explore the secondary school experiences of students with mental retardation. Topics include the instructional practices in general, vocational, and nonvocational special education classrooms; the participation of students in various classroom settings; accommodations and support services provided to students; how their experiences compare with those of their classmates; and how students with mental retardation perform academically. Specifically, this fact sheet begins by providing a description of the educational experiences of students with mental retardation in terms of the types of schools they attended, grade levels, and course taking by educational setting. The fact sheet then describes their experiences in three types of classes--general education academic, vocational education, and nonvocational special education classes. Each of these sections provides information about aspects of their educational experience within that type of educational setting, such as curriculum modification, types of instruction, students' active participation, and teachers' perceptions and expectations of student performance. Findings related to their receipt of accommodations and supports are presented next. The fact sheet closes with a focus on the academic achievement of students with mental retardation.

AB  - A core goal of inclusive education worldwide is to maximize the learning potential of students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream educational settings. However, little research attention has been paid to SEN children's social and emotional gains from inclusive education compared to their academic performance. This study included social, emotional, and academic variables in a single research design, not only to test their relationships but also to explore the predictive roles of social and emotional factors in academic performance for SEN students. Participants were 515 SEN students in grades 1-6 in mainstream primary schools in Hong Kong. The results showed that the social and emotional competences of children with SEN were significant predictors of their academic performance (p < .001), with emotional competence having the larger impact. Although SEN students' relationships with peers and teachers were not found to be direct significant predictors of academic performance as reported in previous studies; they positively and significantly predicted emotional and social competences of SEN students (p < .001). Implications for establishing a caring campus, as well as developing educational interventions which will increase SEN students' positive emotional experiences and foster and maintain their adaptive social and emotional competences are discussed.

AB  - This dissertation is comprised of three studies using restricted data from the ECLS-K:1998 to address the questions who is placed in special education? and what happens after they are placed? Though these questions have been extensively studied, existing research has largely ignored the intersection of longitudinal developmental pathways and service delivery. In Study 1 ('Examining Longitudinal Patterns of K-8 Special Education Service Receipt') special educational trajectories from Kindergarten through grade 8 were analyzed using latent class growth modeling. Relative to students who never receive services, students with disabilities fell into three trajectories: Persistent (students received uninterrupted services from Kindergarten through 8th grade), Terminal (students received services for the first few years of schooling, then exited out of special education), and Delayed (students were not placed in special education until partway through schooling). Multinomial logistic regression revealed that different combinations of child, home, and schooling factors predicted the odds of following these trajectories of special education, which bears consideration in cross-sectional identification research. Study 2 ('Contextualizing Patterns of Special Education Placement and Service Receipt') explored how individual likelihoods of receiving special education services were impacted by 1) the contributions of individual and aggregated data, 2) modeling longitudinal trajectories from Kindergarten through eighth grade, and 3) analyzing how the schooling context differentially influences students from varying backgrounds and with different levels of achievement or behavior. Results revealed that individual-level data was most predictive of service receipt, though between a quarter and a third of the variability in special education status occurred between schools; different factors predicted the likelihood of receiving services early in schooling relative to later in schooling; and that the schooling context did not appear to differentially affect the longitudinal likelihood of service receipt by race/ethnicity, achievement, or behavior. This study is important for researchers and policymakers focused on the early identification of disability and early identification disparities. Lastly, Study 3 ('What Happens to Students in Special Education? Academic Achievement and Behavioral Adjustment Following Identification') assessed the development of reading, math, problem behaviors, and positive learning habits among students receiving earlier or later services. Though advocates argue that early intervention is the best solution to alleviate academic or behavioral issues, evidence toward the effectiveness of special education as an intervention is meager and mixed. In this study, the propensity to receive services in either 1st grade or 3rd grade was modeled by matching students who received services at least once during grades 1-8 on a host of Kindergarten covariates. Results indicated that students who received initial services in 1st grade made larger reading gains and scored higher tests of reading than students who received services later in schooling. In contrast, students who received initial services in 3rd grade did not significantly differ from their peers on any academic outcomes. Overall, this dissertation weaves together a coherent story regarding who receives special education services, at what developmental timepoints, and where, as well as what are the consequences of receiving services at different timepoints during K-8 schooling. Addressing developmental trajectories of service receipt also extended and validated existing research by clarifying previous inconsistencies and oversimplifications. Educators and policymakers should continue advocating for early services, and researchers should strive to understand why delayed service receipt occurs, particularly among urban students with less-educated mothers.

AB  - In the field of special education, there is much debate as to whether there are measurable differences evident between those children who receive special education and those who do not. Previous research in the area yielded equivocal results about the benefits of placement into special education, creating much doubt about the effectiveness of special education programs. The present study examined differences between groups of children eligible for special education over a ten-year period. Measures of intelligence, achievement, and behavior were examined to determine whether they were indicative of placement into special education, number of handicapping conditions a child had, or the intensity of special education service. Grade of entry and exit from special education was also explored. Subjects were 427 children from a city school system. Data collection began on the first day of kindergarten in 1987 and 1988. Follow-up data collection occurred ten years later. Three major questions were posed: (1) What, if any, differences are present over time between children who receive special education services and those who do not? (2) What, if any, differences are present between children within special education who are placed into a self-contained classroom, or are reclassified? and (3) What, if any, factors influence the grade of entry and exit from special education? Discriminant analysis was used to investigate differences between children who received special education services and those who did not. Eligibility for special education was indicated by measures of IQ and behavior at kindergarten, 3rd, 5th, and 8th grades. A more in depth look into differences between children within special education revealed that those students who received services for more than half of the day had lower IQ scores at school entry and lower reading achievement scores at 3 rd, 5th and 8th grades. To investigate rates of entry and exit from special education, a survival analysis was conducted. Participants who had discipline records tended to enter in later grades than those with no history of discipline problems. Those children who were initially identified as speech/language disordered exited special education earlier than those identified in other disability categories. Discipline history and retention were other factors that influenced grade of exit from special education.

AB  - This study examined the peer relationships and social behaviors of deaf adolescents in the first 2 years of secondary school. Peer nominations and ratings of peer status and behavior were collected longitudinally with 74 deaf and 271 hearing adolescents from Grade 7 to Grade 8. The predictions of deaf adolescents' peer status in Grade 8 from Grade 7 behaviors differed between mainstream education and special education settings. The behaviors of deaf early adolescents in the beginning of secondary school strongly predicted their peer status a year later. For deaf mainstream students, withdrawn behavior was the most important and negative predictor of peer status. For deaf students in special education settings, prosocial behavior was the most important and positive predictor of peer status.

AB  - Abstract: This study examined associations of communicative skills, social behavior, and personality with acceptance and popularity as a function of hearing status, gender, and educational setting. Participants were 87 deaf and 672 hearing early adolescents of 52 6th grade classrooms in mainstream and special education. Acceptance varied as a function of hearing status by gender; popularity varied as a function of hearing status and educational setting. Deaf boys in mainstream education were less accepted and popular than their hearing classmates and than deaf peers in special education. Deaf girls in mainstream education were also less popular but not less accepted. Communicative skills varied as a function of hearing status, whereas social behavior varied as a function of educational setting. Deaf mainstreamed children showed less developed pragmatic and strategic communicative skills (monitoring, improvisation, initiating/maintaining) than their hearing classmates, but more social adjustment than deaf peers in special education (more prosocial behavior, less antisocial or withdrawn behavior, and more agreeableness). For acceptance, deaf girls in mainstream education compensated the lack of improvisation with higher levels of prosocial behavior, agreeableness, monitoring, and pragmatic skills, and lower levels of antisocial behavior than deaf boys. Monitoring and pragmatic skills negatively affected a deaf mainstream boy''s acceptance. In special education, gender differences in prosocial behavior explained deaf boys’ lower acceptance. Popularity was explained by pragmatic skills and improvisation as a function of hearing status. Voter population difference and different social behavior norms are considered as an explanation for popularity differences as a function of educational setting.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the self-concept-as-learner of thirty-four, third through sixth grade, mainstreamed African-American learning disabled students in two academic settings: The resource room and the regular classroom. Several hypotheses were tested: (1) Mainstreamed students with disabilities reflected a higher self-concept-as-learner in resource room than in the regular classroom; (2) The self-concept-as-learner declined as students progressed through school; (3) There is a relationship between reading achievement and self-concept-as-learners as measured by student's reading levels on their IEP's; (4) There is a correlation between student's reading levels and their self-concept-as-learners. Students were assessed twice using the The Florida Key: Inferred and professed version 1-12 (Purkey, Cage, & Stanley, 1993), once in the regular classroom and once in the resource room. Each student was assessed by one of twenty regular classroom teachers and by one of nine special educators. A variety of statistical instruments were used for testing the data from The Florida Key and reading scores from the IEP's. Descriptive analyses included measures of central tendency and variability, and frequency distributions. Inferential analyses included t-tests, Pearson r, Analysis of Variance, Student-Neuman-Keuls, and Least Significant Differences. The first hypothesis was supported for “teacher” responses with statistical results below the alpha level, that students in the resource room reflected a higher self-concept-as-learner. This finding adds empirical support for the theory that the self-concept-as learner changes from time to time. Responses for “students” showed moderate statistically significant correlations, an indication that students perceive themselves to possess high self-concepts-as-learners regardless of the academic setting. Findings for the second hypothesis that there would be a decline in the self-concept-as-learner as children progressed through school showed fifth grade students to have higher self-concepts-as-learners than fourth graders at a statistically significant level. An investigation of the tests sample indicated interesting data for further analysis. Tests for third and fourth hypotheses did not reveal significant results; however, valuable information was rendered for future studies. A major inference from this study is that students' self-concepts-as-learners are not fixed. Training for educators should include methods for enhancing the self-concept-as-learner of students regardless of the academic setting.

AB  - There is a need for active student participation in special education programs in order to ensure that the special education programs meet the needs of the students. The current study discusses the research on perspectives of students in special education and how those perspectives can influence program development and characteristics. Research on inclusion versus pull-out is examined, as well as student perceptions, student perception accuracy, and student involvement in their special education programs. The current study interviewed high school special education students in one Central Valley school. The structured interview addressed student attitudes in regards to four areas: their special education program involvement, feelings about their classes, accommodations, and their views of their teachers. Comparison of opinions and feelings between students served through an inclusion model or a pull-out model indicated relatively few differences in perceptions and opinions regarding their involvement in their special education programs, their feelings about their classes, their views on accommodations, and their attitudes towards their teachers. Implications for student participation in program development are discussed. Copies of dissertations may be obtained by addressing your request to ProQuest, 789 E. Eisenhower Parkway, P.O.

AB  - This study investigated high school students with special needs and their non-disabled peers in a Maryland public school system who were taught by co-teachers and a comparable group of students with special needs and their non-disabled peers who were taught by a single teacher to compare student achievement among these two groups in the general education setting. The researcher examined the effects of two different instructional models (a co-teaching model and a traditional single teacher model) on student achievement in an 'Algebra with Assistance' course. The sample consisted of 74 students, 25 of whom received special education services and 49 who were non-disabled peers. These students were selected for the Algebra with Assistance course based on three criterion: grade eight mathematics state assessment scores, grade eight course grades, and teacher recommendations. Student achievement and classroom observation data were collected over one school year during their ninth grade experience. The researcher found there was no significant difference in student achievement between the co-taught group and the traditional group, either the students with special needs or their non-disabled peers. Nor was there any significant qualitative difference between these two groups with regard to the instructional methods and tools employed by their respective teachers.

AB  - This study examined instructional processes and student outcomes in two models of special education: (a) special education/general education co-teaching (CT) and (b) resource room instruction (RR). Specifically, it examined: (a) how instructional practices differed between CT, RR, and general education single-teacher instruction (SI); (b) the extent to which students' academic engagement changed across the three settings; (c) how achievement outcomes differed between students receiving CT and RR instruction and the extent to which they were normalized (i.e., become similar to the levels of average achievers in general education); and (d) teacher perceptions of CT and RR instruction. A case study with replications approach was employed. Multiple observations were conducted on ten students with learning disabilities (LD) and ten average-achieving (AA) students during Language Arts instruction. Half of the students with LD were receiving CT services, and half were receiving RR services. It was predicted that classroom processes would vary by setting and that student engagement and achievement would vary as a function of classroom processes. Achievement outcomes were assessed using curriculum-based measures (CBM) of reading and writing collected on multiple occasions and state-mandated reading achievement tests. Teachers also participated in interviews about their perceptions of CT or RR instructional models at the close of the school year. Results revealed few differences between the two types of special education services or between general education and special education. Classroom observations indicated high rates of academic instruction and student engagement, and very low rates of one-on-one instruction in all three settings. Of the eight predicted differences between settings, only one was confirmed: CT instruction was associated with more student-teacher discussions than general education instruction. In terms of student academic growth, no differences were found in reading and writing CBM slopes for students receiving CT and RR instruction. Findings also revealed that students with LD continued to lag behind their AA peers in reading. Implications of these findings regarding the delivery of instruction for students with learning disabilities as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Coping behaviour, perceived control, and the self concept of elementary school children with learning disabilities educated in regular and special education classrooms was examined using a comparative design. In addition, the influence of teachers' classroom management orientation on children's self-perceptions and coping behaviour was investigated. Children attending a special school for students with learning disabilities were found to be more adaptive copers than children in special education classes in regular schools, children receiving resource room assistance, and children mainstreamed in regular classes. Children with learning disabilities were found to have positive perceptions of their global self-worth regardless of the type of class they were in, although they indicated less confidence in their academic abilities compared to their self-perceptions of physical appearance and athletic competence. In general, most children believed that they were responsible for their academic successes and at the same time perceived academic failure as unavoidable. The students who coped most effectively demonstrated the most realistic appraisals of their academic situation. They recognized that they could not control academic failure, however, they believed that the best way to succeed in school was by continuing to exert effort. Additionally, successful copers held high expectations for future academic success and believed that they possessed the capacities needed to achieve this success. Children who coped most effectively strongly endorsed beliefs in their capacity to have a positive relationship with their teachers. Children who were rated as effective copers had teachers whose instructional orientation promoted autonomous functioning in their students.

AB  - Altruism is a prosocial trait that demonstrates selfless concern for others. Lack of altruism can result in school violence and truancy. Educational inclusion has been found to positively impact students with varied disabilities and their peers, socially and academically, but no studies investigated the relationship between general education students and altruism in inclusion settings. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of inclusion on altruism for general education elementary students based on social cognitive theory. This quasi-experimental study measured the effect of inclusion of students with emotional disturbance on the altruism levels of general education students using the Child Altruism Inventory (CAI). A sample of 158 nondisabled, 3rd and 4th grade boys and girls completed the CAI before and 12 weeks after integration of students with emotional disturbance. A control group in a noninclusion classroom and a treatment group from an inclusive classroom with peers with an emotional disturbance were utilized at each grade level. Results of ANOVA testing demonstrated a significant relationship between inclusion on altruism. Regression analyses showed that female students demonstrated higher altruism at pretest and posttest than males, and 9-year-old students demonstrated higher altruism than 8 and 10 year olds. Findings indicated integrating students with emotional disturbance into classrooms significantly raised the altruism levels of their peers. This could result in positive social change because the altruistic benefit of inclusive educational practice may foster heightened sensitivity to individual differences, reduce classroom truancy and violence, and increase prosocial behaviors in future diverse communities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was threefold: (a) to examine the academic progress of students in reading, who have a learning disability in reading, as they transfer from pull-out support services to inclusion services; and (b) to examine the academic progress of general education students in reading, as they transfer from a general education setting to an inclusive setting; and (c) to determine teachers' attitudes toward including children with special needs. The quantitative portion of the study involved two years of Tennessee Value-Added (TVAAS) scores for general education students as well as scores of students with a reading disability. The qualitative portion of this study utilized a modified scale of teachers' attitude toward inclusive classrooms. Participating teachers received a teacher opinion survey that determined teacher attitude toward including students with special needs. The results from this study revealed that most teachers have positive attitudes toward including students with special needs. Approximately 10 elementary school teachers were recruited to participate in the survey. The quantitative portion of the study indicated there were statistically significant differences in scores of general education students as they moved into an inclusive environment. General education students' test scores significantly declined once they were placed in an inclusive setting. However, the finding from this study showed no statistically significant difference in scores of students with a reading disability once they were moved from a pull-out support setting to an inclusion support setting. It is recommended that future research include larger and more heterogeneous participant pools that include race and gender variables.

AB  - Traditionally, children requiring special educational needs (SEN) are segregated into separate learning environments. While this education practice has been established for years, other educators and analysts have been questioning its efficacy. Most of them suggest that students with SEN should be included into mainstream schools to maximize their learning experiences. Several other benefits as well as issues have been raised in relation to this educational issue. In this paper, the factors related to the education and inclusion of students with SEN, including the curriculum, attitude of the educators, professional development, equality issues as well as learning experiences, will be discussed. The significance and relevant effects of these factors will be the basis of the conclusion of this paper on whether inclusion should be adapted.

AB  - Children with cochlear implants who graduated from the Auditory-Verbal Center of Atlanta, GA, were surveyed. The survey determined the educational placement of these graduates. The results indicate most of the graduates were integrated into the regular education setting. Early intervention that leads to language development appears to reduce the impact of hearing impairment on student placement into mainstream academic settings. School social workers, functioning as interdisciplinary team members for students with disabilities, have a unique opportunity to provide education, advocacy, & placement input for children with hearing impairments into the most appropriate, least restrictive educational environment. 1 Table, 12 References.

AB  - This action research study investigated whether the participation in an inclusive educational setting improved the academic achievement of fourth grade students with specific learning disabilities. The study examined one independent variable and two dependent variables. The independent variable was the type of model students were instructed in year to year; pull-out/resource classroom model in 2011 and an inclusive co-taught classroom model in 2012. The dependent variables were Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) scores in reading and mathematics. In addition, the study analyzed students and teachers' perspectives about inclusion. The action research study involved 15 fourth grade students with specific learning disabilities and 8 teachers, 4 regular education teachers and 4 special education teachers. Using a quantitative action research design, this study addressed four research questions. Paired samples t tests were created using students' CRCT mathematics and reading scores and a one-sample chi-square test of pass/fail rates on the CRCT. Descriptive statistics were generated to analyze the survey responses from both teachers and students. Results of the action research study did not reveal a statistically significant difference in the reading and mathematics scores from year to year. In addition, the findings did not reveal a statistically significant difference in the percentage of students who met state standards in mathematics and reading. Although findings were insignificant, students CRCT reading and mathematics scores increased during the year of inclusive co-teaching along with the percentage of students meeting state standards in reading and mathematics. Responses to both teacher and student surveys revealed an overall positive perspective towards inclusive practices and settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The literature dealing with the inclusion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mainstream schools has increased over recent years, propelled by the argument that it will improve the quality of life, educational performance and social development of "included" children. This area of research is currently an important one for the development of policy and practice. The literature on inclusion dealing with the inclusion of children with ASD is limited, so the implementation of inclusion has preceded research. The current study investigated whether children in mainstream placements show enhanced performance, relative to those in specialist provisions. The study used a combination of primary and secondary data analysis to explore the impact of inclusion on children with ASD in four authorities in the south east of England. The results suggest that mainstream children have no greater academic success than children in specialist provision. The study suggests that a number of specific provisions are involved in promoting success, such as Speech and Language Therapy, and the impact of Learning Support Assistants, and these are also reviewed and discussed.

AB  - The past ten years have seen a growing drive towards 'full inclusion' of children with Autistic Spectrum Conditions (ASC) in schools however this has not been accompanied by sufficient research on its impact. This thesis evaluates the effectiveness of inclusion. But at the same time, as the movement towards inclusion appears unstoppable, it also looks at ways practice could improve outcomes, and, in particular, whether teaching the Preschool Inventory of Repertoires for Kindergarten (PIRK) curriculum can help prepare a child for mainstream. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used, and primary and secondary data analysed. Eight focus groups, between five- and eight-strong, ascertained the views of both professionals and parents on what promotes successful inclusion. Predictors and outcome measures, such as academic results, were extracted from secondary data of archival material on 108 children to compare those with ASC placed in mainstream and special schools. In addition, primary data on parental coping and severity were collected as predictors of success. Longitudinal primary data of 83 children, measuring social, behavioural, and communicative functioning, were collected to assess the effect of placement on these measures. Finally, longitudinal primary data for 47 children, measuring social, behavioural and communicative functioning of children undergoing the PIRK in both mainstream and special schools were analysed to see whether preparation for mainstream can improve outcomes. The findings suggest that placement is having a differential effect, but that special schools can improve performance significantly, despite the existing bias against them. However, practice along with extra-school factors, such as parental coping styles, is often more important than the placement itself. School, LEA and child factors were shown to be crucial in mainstream. Teaching using the PIRK improved outcomes for children with ASC in both placements, supporting its use in preparation for mainstream.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to examine students with disabilities self-perceptions of their academic and social supports in the general and special education classroom and the impact of the students' counterstories to inform the design of classroom supports. This study was anchored in organizational theory, critical race theory, and the special education inclusion literature that supports the positive achievement and positive social effects for students with disabilities in the general education program. I make a case for the use of Critical Race Theory as a means to address ableism and argue for the use of more qualitative and transformative research to address the research to practice gap in the special education literature. The dissertation was a case study of eight high school students and six of their teachers. The experimental design was an explanatory mixed methods approach collecting five cycles of quantitative and qualitative data. The cycles collected data related to the students' preferred classroom supports, their academic identity, teachers classroom supports, and the impact of the students counterstories on their teachers instructional design. Findings suggest students prefer individual supports, feel more successful in their general education classes that are challenging than in special education classes, and possess many of the positive non-cognitive factors associated with student success.

AB  - Background: Several barriers are hampering the provision of adequate education to students with special educational needs in mainstream primary schools. It is not clear how many and which students in the Netherlands are considered children with special educational needs. The problems that make teachers consider children to have special educational needs and the effect of different types of problems on the school career have not often been addressed in research studies. Furthermore, contextual factors, like teachers' attitudes on inclusion and the number of students with special needs in the class may influence the school career of children with special educational needs. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the proportion of Dutch students in mainstream primary schools with special educational needs, their literacy and numeracy attainment levels, the likelihood of referral to special education and effects of teachers' attitudes towards inclusion and of the percentage of students with special needs in class. Sample: We use data on 8237 students with special educational needs in mainstream primary education from two consecutive measurements of a large cohort study in the Netherlands called PRIMA. Results: We found that, according to the teachers, on average 26% of the students in their classes had special educational needs. Cognitive problems had a much stronger effect on the school career than social-emotional and physical problems. As expected, teachers with a positive attitude towards the inclusion of students with special educational needs referred fewer children to special education than teachers with less positive attitudes towards inclusion. Furthermore, the likelihood of a student being referred to a special school was reduced as the number of students with special needs in the class increased. Conclusions: Depending on factors in the learning context, special educational needs of a child may or may not be recognised. Consequently, children's special educational needs may not always be sufficiently catered for. (Contains 6 tables.)

AB  - Objectives: To compare the quality of life (QoL) of children with hearing loss (HL) and children with normal hearing (NH) and to examine how the QoL of children with HL changes over time, considering language skills, type of hearing device, degree of HL, and type of education. Methods and materials: This longitudinal study included 62 children with HL and their parents. Developmental outcome data were collected at two time points, when the mean ages of the children were 4 and 11 years. The Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL (TM)) questionnaire, which includes assessments of Physical, Emotional, Social, and School functioning, was completed by parents at both time points and by the children with HL at the second time point. Receptive and expressive language skills at 4 years were assessed by the Reynell Developmental Language Scale. Results were compared with a Dutch normative sample. Results: The QoL of children with HL was similar to that of children with NH at both time points on two of the four QoL scales, Emotional and Physical functioning. On the other two scales, Social and School functioning, children with HL who attended special education and children who switched to mainstream education showed lower scores than children with HL who were consistently in mainstream education and lower scores than children with NH. The School QoL of children with HL decreased over time, as did the School QoL of children with NH. Social QoL of children with cochlear implants decreased over time, but this was not the case in children with hearing aids. Language skills and the degree of HL did not clinically improve the QoL over time of preschool children with HL. Conclusions: The QoL of children with HL in mainstream education and the Physical and Emotional QoL of all children with HL were satisfactory. It is essential to develop specific guidance regarding school activities for children with HL in special education and for children with HL who switch to mainstream education in order to increase their social QoL.

AB  - This study compared the subjective and school-related happiness of 75 11- to 16-year-old special education students to 77 age- and gender-matched mainstream students using two quantitative measures. Additionally, the respondents chose from a list of 12 putative happy makers what they felt increased their happiness. Ten special education students also described their opinions on happiness qualitatively. In both quantitative measures, the special education students reported lower happiness than did their counterparts. Girls reported lower happiness than did boys in subjective happiness. Both educational groups valued money, success in school and leisure time. The most frequent choice of special education students was to have more friends. This paper discusses reasons for the relative unhappiness of special education children.

AB  - The placement of special education students has been an issue concerning education for years. Since the inception of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1997), students with disabilities have been increasingly included into the regular education program. This integration was mostly to provide and increase social opportunities for special education students. However, with the addition of No Child Left Behind (2001), accountability for educating all students has increased. Schools are now measured by annual yearly progress, and this progress is measured for all students, regular and special education, in the form of state assessments. Therefore, many schools are struggling to determine which educational setting is the most appropriate for a special education student to gain the necessary content. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of educational placement on students with disabilities. This quantitative study measured the academic success of special education students in grades six through eight on the Tennessee state assessment, Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) 2010. The information gathered in this study can be used to assist school systems and teachers in making decisions about the academic placement for special education students.

AB  - We compared two instructional models (co-teaching inclusion and solo-taught special education) for students with learning disabilities (LD) with regard to their effect on academic achievement and class attendance. Twelve inclusive classes (experimental group) and 13 special education classes (control group) participated in the study. In grade 1, there were eight inclusive classes and nine special education classes with a total of 353 students (195 without disabilities, 58 with LD in inclusion and 100 with LD in special education classes). The data were collected from academic tests. Although our results revealed no significant difference between the two models in terms of target population, objectives and assigned resources, significant differences were observed in the effects on student outcomes in reading/writing and on attendance, as the inclusion model was shown to be globally more effective compared with the special education setting.

AB  - This article compares the effectiveness of two educational schemes (inclusion and special needs education) intended for pupils with learning troubles or difficulties. Twelve inclusive classes (experimental group) and thirteen special needs classes (control group) took part in the research. Findings reveal that there are few differences between the two schemes in terms of pupils and the resources allotted to them. However, major differences concern teaching effectiveness, mainly in reading and writing. Overall, the inclusive scheme is more effective than the special needs approach. //ABSTRACT IN FRENCH: Cet article traite de la comparaison de l'efficacité de deux dispositifs scolaires (inclusion et enseignement spécialisé) destinés à des élèves ayant des difficultés ou des troubles d'apprentissage. Douze classes inclusives (groupe expérimental) et treize classes d'enseignement spécialisé (groupe contrôle) ont participé à la recherche. Les résultats montrent que les deux dispositifs se distinguent peu en ce qui concerne leur population et les ressources qui leur sont attribuées. Toutefois des différences significatives apparaissent pour l'efficacité pédagogique, principalement en lecture et écriture. Le dispositif d'inclusion se montre globalement plus efficace que celui d'enseignement spécialisé. Reproduced by permission of Bibliothèque de Sciences Po

AB  - A major concern facing special educators is how best to educate students with mild intellectual disability, and whether regular or special classes are appropriate. The big fish little pond effect (BFLPE) predicts that students with mild intellectual disability will have higher academic self-concepts when in a special class, whereas labeling theory predicts that placing these students in special classes will lower their self-concepts. This study addresses some of these issues by: identifying a psychometrically sound, multidimensional self-concept measurement instrument; critically examining the structure and nature of self-concepts; investigating the effects of regular and special class placement upon students’ self-concepts, social comparison processes, academic achievement, and stigmatisation; and evaluating the legitimacy of the BFLPE and labeling theory. Three studies were conducted on 211 students in years 2-6. The first study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Self Description Questionnaire I Individual Administration (SDQI-IA) and examined the structure and self-concepts of the sample, and results demonstrated that the SDQI-IA is a valid and reliable measure. The second study tested the BLFPE and labeling theory and results provided support for the BFLPE. The third study measured the self-concepts, social comparison processes and academic achievement of 39 students in different education placements, with results revealing that students moved to special classes reported higher academic achievement and more favourable social comparisons than their counterparts in regular classes

AB  - This longitudinal study investigates the differences in cognitive and socio‐emotional development and academic achievement between children educated in special education classes (N = 37) and regular classes (N = 37). The study is retrospective. The first measurement point was while children were attending play‐oriented kindergarten and no decision about their education had yet been made. The second measurement point followed after 2 years of schooling. Comparing carefully matched groups, no differences in executive functions (EFs) were found before beginning school. Children assigned to special education had poorer language, fine motor skills and a lower pre‐academic self‐concept, self‐regulatory skills and social integration. Notably, every fourth child in special education was an immigrant, 9% of whom later attended regular classes. After 2 years of schooling in either setting, the groups differed significantly in academic achievement, EFs, fine motor skills and cognitive self‐regulatory skills. However, it was not—as school officials had intended—that children in special education classes had caught up, except in regard to their academic self‐concept and social integration.

AB  - Benefits of inclusive education for students with extensive and pervasive support needs (ESN) have been documented over the past several decades. However, simply placing students with ESN in general education settings does not constitute inclusion, nor does this necessarily result in positive outcomes for students. This study utilizes ecobehavioral analysis to provide an understanding of the characteristics of general education academic classes that include students with ESN and explores differences in characteristics between different schooling levels and students with and without complex communication needs. Findings indicate inclusive placements for students with ESN provide an engaging academic environment with adaptations to access content and low levels of distractions. Implications for practice, future research, and policy are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To examine the impact of classroom placement and mode of communication on speech intelligibility scores in children aged 8 to 9 years using multichannel cochlear implants. Design: Classroom placement (special education, partial mainstream, and full mainstream) and mode of communication (total communication and auditory-oral) reported via parental rating scales before and 4 times after implantation were the independent variables. Speech intelligibility scores obtained at 8 to 9 years of age were the dependent variables. Participants: The study included 131 congenitally deafened children between the ages of 8 and 9 years who received a multichannel cochlear implant before the age of 5 years. Results: Higher speech intelligibility scores at 8 to 9 years of age were significantly associated with enrollment in auditory-oral programs rather than enrollment in total communication programs, regardless of when the mode of communication was used (before or after implantation). Speech intelligibility at 8 to 9 years of age was not significantly influenced by classroom placement before implantation, regardless of mode of communication. After implantation, however, there were significant associations between classroom placement and speech intelligibility scores at 8 to 9 years of age. Higher speech intelligibility scores at 8 to 9 years of age were associated with classroom exposure to normal-hearing peers in full or partial mainstream placements than in self-contained, special education placements. Conclusions: Higher speech intelligibility scores in 8-to 9-year-old congenitally deafened cochlear implant recipients were associated with educational settings that emphasize oral communication development. Educational environments that incorporate exposure to normal-hearing peers were also associated with higher speech intelligibility scores at 8 to 9 years of age.

AB  - The evolution of special education has led to the development of service models that provide students with disabilities the opportunity to be in the general education classroom while facilitating the placement through additional support. As one of these service models, co-teaching has been shown to offer benefits to students with special needs and teachers, but little research is available regarding the impact of co-teaching on students at different levels of academic performance. By considering student perceptions of co-teaching and the achievement scores of co-taught students, the researcher examined the effect of co-teaching on student performance, paying specific attention to how students with special needs, general education students, and gifted students were influenced by the service model. Through the analysis of surveys, interviews, and CRCT scores, numerous trends were noted in the data. Students from all levels of academic performance expressed positive perceptions of co-teaching, stating the benefit of receiving extra help and having multiple instructional perspectives in the classroom. But despite the general positive attitudes about co-teaching, a pervasive negative assumption about co-teaching was evident in student responses. Quantitative data revealed a significant increase in CRCT scores for students with disabilities in a co-taught math class and no significant change in CRCT scores for general education and gifted students. Limitations such as small sample size and the researcher's previous relationship with some participants may have restricted the generalizability of the results. Future research should increase the size of the study in an effort to increase the reliability of the findings. Additionally, future studies should control for outside factors that could also impact results, such as variability in testing content, cultural differences, and socioeconomic status.

AB  - We use longitudinal data on all high school students in Washington State, including postsecondary education and workforce outcomes, to investigate predictors of intermediate and postsecondary outcomes for students with disabilities. We pay particular attention to career and technical education (CTE) enrollment and the extent of inclusion in general education classrooms, as prior research suggests these factors may be particularly important in influencing the outcomes of students with disabilities. We estimate models that compare students with other students within the same school district, who are receiving special education services for the same disability, and have similar baseline measures of academic performance and other demographic information. We find generally weak relationships between CTE enrollment in any particular grade and intermediate and postsecondary outcomes for students with disabilities, though we replicate earlier findings that students with disabilities who are enrolled in a "concentration" of CTE courses have higher rates of employment after graduation than students with disabilities who are similar in other observable ways but are enrolled in fewer CTE courses. We also find consistently strong evidence that students with disabilities who spend more time in general education classrooms experience better outcomes--fewer absences, higher academic performance, higher rates of grade progression and on-time graduation, and higher rates of college attendance and employment--than students with disabilities who are similar in other observable ways but spend less time in general education classrooms.

AB  - In this article we present the results of a prospective panel study designed to analyze the development of speech-language-impaired children from varying educational backgrounds in Baden-Württemberg. The results reveal differences between schooling in inclusive versus separate settings with regard to emphases in the design of the education offering and of supporting activities. While special schools with focus on speech language impaired children often integrate supporting measures into the regular tuition (immanent support), individual or small group special tuition in addition to the regular tuition are more frequent in inclusive settings (additive support).The latter is meant to compensate for the shorter teaching time by special needs teachers with focus on children with speech-language-impairment at regular primary schools through providing additional support measures inside and outside of school. The choice of the support setting (separate/additive versus integrated/immanent) is also dependent on the identified support needs of the child. Phonetically-phonologically impaired children are preferably supported in a separate setting through additive measures, while children with vocabulary deficits are preferably supported in small groups or in regular class through immanent support. The presence of two tutors in class positively impacts the academic development of the child, irrespective of the type of schooling. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Die vorgestellten Ergebnisse stammen aus einer prospektiven Längsschnittstudie zur Erfassung der Entwicklung sprachbeeinträchtigter Kinder in unterschiedlichen Beschulungsformen in Baden-Württemberg. Dabei werden verschiedene Schwerpunkte bei der Gestaltung der Bildungsangebote sowie zusätzlicher Unterstützungsangebote in inklusiven bzw. separierenden Settings deutlich. Während in den Sprachheilschulen (SHS) die Förderung häufig in den Unterricht integriert wird (immanente Sprachförderung), ist in inklusiven Settings der Anteil an Einzel- und Kleingruppenförderung (additive Sprachförderung) größer. Dies wird als Bemühen gedeutet, die geringere Unterrichtszeit durch spezifisch ausgebildete Lehrkräfte mit Förderschwerpunkt .Sprache' an den Grundschulen durch additive Maßnahmen innerhalb und außerhalb der Schule auszugleichen. Außerdem wird die Wahl des Fördersettings (isoliert, additiv bzw. integriert oder immanent) durch die identifizierten Förderbereiche der Kinder bestimmt. So werden Kinder mit phonetisch-phonologi-schen Störungen bevorzugt isoliert oder additiv im Einzelsetting unterstützt, während Kinder mit Wortschatzdefiziten bevorzugt Unterstützung in der Kleingruppe oder im Klassenunterricht erhalten. Es zeigen sich positive Zusammenhänge der Schulleistungsentwicklung der Kinder mit dem Ausmaß an Doppelbesetzung durch zwei Lehrkräfte unabhängig von der Beschulungsform.

AB  - Social support and academic engagement are effective in promoting the resilience and school completion of many at-risk student groups. For students with disabilities, a paucity of research in these areas leaves the influence of and relationships between these factors less clear. The current study used data gathered from a Midwestern elementary district to examine students' perceptions of social support and academic engagement and how those variables may be related to the disability severity of students receiving special education. Additional analyses were conducted to examine potential differences between the general education and special education groups within the sample. Although no moderating effect of social support was found in the relationship between disability severity and academic engagement, other differences between boys and girls receiving special education were found. Implications for interventions with students with disabilities and future directions for research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Direct, explicit instruction for students with disabilities is an exciting challenge for those who work in the field of education. For years, students have been instructed to close the gap in their educational needs based on the Individual Education Plan goals and objectives only and introducing students to an inclusionary form of education with typical peers in order to be exposed to grade-level curriculum. In this study, the expansion of ideas to move from inclusion as a proximity of the student to inclusion by instruction using grade-level materials, differentiation and accommodations in a smaller setting was reviewed. To decide on the effectiveness of the instruction, standardized measures, such as Measures of Academic Performance and statewide end of year testing was analyzed, using previous grade-level data comparing it with the current year data to determine growth. Participants in the study were fifth-grade students in a virtual setting, some who were new to virtual learning and/or inclusion, with academic needs in the areas of reading fluency, reading comprehension, mathematics, written expression and behavioral needs. This study focused solely on the impact of direct explicit instruction as it pertains to mathematics. The results of the study showed T-Value scores resulting in a significance at p < .01. Recommendations for further research includes looking at the instruction provided to students and not solely the proximity of the students to show gains in academics.

AB  - This thesis looks at social scientific and disability related research on visual impairment and education. It starts from a historical perspective, and outlines the radical change of emphasis in research and thinking brought about by the Disabled People's Movement. After showing how this movement has developed, it looks at various aspects of visual impairment, concentrating on rehabilitation, personality research and the symbolism of the eye. The next section looks at the development of education for visually impaired people. It starts from a historical perspective, and relates this to mainstream Sociological research on classroom interaction and school culture. All of these sections highlight the importance of attitudes and social factors, whilst not denying the undoubted impact of visual impairment in itself. 23 visually impaired school pupils were interviewed, each individually, in a wide range of schools, and from a variety of social and educational backgrounds although an age range of 14 to 18 years seemed most suitable, for various reasons, the ages of those interviewed range from 13 to 19 years. For more detail see Chapter 7. The results highlighted a lack of understanding amongst educational establishment and society at large, especially with regard to partial sight. They showed that generally people can live normal lives, but that it is difficult for them to become fully part of groups which include sighted people, mainly due to problems in sighted people's attitudes and the effects of not seeing who and what is around. Varying levels of confidence were found in both mainstream and special schools, and these often related to the level of encouragement given by staff for the visually impaired people to mix with sighted people. 10 sighted colleagues of the visually impaired respondents at three of the schools were also interviewed, again individually. They were aged 15 and 16. Again, see Chapter 7 for more details. They highlighted issues including looking different, not "knowing how to act" around a visually impaired person, and in some schools, a lack of information about visual impairment. It was these issues, along with the availability of more mainstream information for visually impaired people, (especially "top shelf" material) that concerned respondents the most.

AB  - A Research and Analysis of the integrating disabled children in regular classes ---Case: The Huang Pu District of Guangzhou City Abstract This paper gives an analysis about learning in regular classes for exceptional children. There are many unsatisfactory situations for solving the problem of school attendance for exceptional children. The reason for such situations should be attributed to unclear obligation for local governments, low desire of some public schools to adopt these students, because of lacking of professional teacher for special education. In this paper the author has carried out a statistical study of current problems in special education by questionnaire, especially in compulsory education. This thesis consists of six parts. The first part detailed the aim and significance. In the second part it analysis concept and basic character of exceptional children and learning in regular. In the third part, we compared the condition of special education of some countries with that of China. In the fourth part it summarizes currently theories of special education. In the fifth part, studied on the primary school 511 teachers and 42 parents of exceptional children of the Huang Pu district by questionnaire, to research. In the sixth part, according to strategic analysis and assessments to decide the recommendations on how to development on integrating disabled children in regular classes. Key Words Exceptional Children, Integrating disabled children in regular classes, AnalysisAlternate abstract:中文摘要 本文以对特殊儿童的教育安置形式-----随班就读教育进行调查分析。在解决特殊儿童就学问题方面，由于地方政府的职责不够明确，普通学校开展随班就读工作的积极性不高，以及普通学校缺乏特殊教育专业教师，师资力量的薄弱，所以仍存在许多不尽如人意的现象。笔者通过以黄埔区为个案进行调查研究，认为造成这种局面的主要原因是政府行政部门制定的有关法规缺乏具体的可操作性及强制的约束性，地方政府在贯彻执行有关法规时，不能完全落实到位；特殊教育没有得到教育行政部门的足够重视，同时普通学校在开展随班就读教育时方法需进一步改善。 笔者通过对这些问题进行问卷调查和理论分析，试图为推进特殊教育，特别是在义务教育阶段，普通学校中特殊儿童教育工作提供一些理论和实践上的启示。全文共分为6个部分。第一部分主要阐明本文研究的目的和意义；第二部分界定有关概念，分析特殊儿童和随班就读的概念和基本特征。第三部分进行国内外特殊儿童在普通学校受教育的现状对比；第四部分综述现代有关特殊教育的理念；第五部分是以黄埔区为研究个案，对区内28所普通小学的511名教师和42名特殊学生家长进行问卷调查，分析目前随班就读教育中存在的问题。第六部分根据客观的分析和评价，对促进特殊儿童随班就读的发展提出了建议。

AB  - Three studies examined the generalizability and moderators of the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE), i.e., the influence of class-average achievement on students' academic self-concept (ASC), among ten-year-old students with and without intellectual disability in Poland. Study 1, conducted on a representative sample of ten-year-olds (N = 4252), used a new, short scale to measure ASC and showed that ASC was positively associated with academic achievement but negatively associated with class-average achievement: the BFLPE. The second study (N = 5276) replicated the BFLPE and showed that the effect was stronger in pupils who were well integrated into their school (high emotional integration) but weakly integrated with their peers (low social integration). The third study replicated the BFLPE, and its moderation by emotional and social integration, in students with mild intellectual disability (N = 605) attending segregated (special) or non-segregated (integrative and regular) school.

AB  - Abstract The authors sought to assess the effectiveness of integrative and inclusive education in Poland as well as to determine the relations between the psychosocial functioning and school achievement of pupils with mild intellectual disability attending special, integrative, and mainstream schools. Nearly 900 (n = 859) grade four pupils rated their social and emotional integration within their school and took a school achievement test. Pupils from integrative and mainstream schools achieved significantly higher scores in the school achievement test than pupils from special schools, whereas students from special schools were significantly better integrated emotionally and socially than integrative and mainstream school students. Additionally, emotional integration was a positive predictor for school achievement of pupils attending special schools. Among pupils attending integrative and mainstream schools, the relationship between emotional and social integration and school achievement was more complex and curvilinear: The highest results were achieved by the best and the worst integrated pupils. These findings are discussed in the context of inclusive education theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article presents the results of a study of school achievement and socio-emotional integration in pupils with mild intellectual disability finishing Grade 3 of primary school. The participants attended schools/classes organized according to three different principles: special schools, integrated classes and regular classes. The main research question which this study strove to answer was: how does reduction of special educational care affect participants' school achievement and psycho-social functioning? The study yielded the following findings: There were no significant differences between the pupils in the three different organizational forms of education as far as cognitive achievement is concerned. However, the pupils in special schools had the most beneficial psychosocial situation. They felt most comfortable at school, rated their peer relations most highly and were most motivated to study. Finally, the study demonstrated that special educational care at school weakens the relationship between pupils' school achievement and their psycho-social situation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the self-esteem of learning disabled children attending special classes, compared to the self-esteem of children attending ordinary classes. It was assumed that: a) the academic self-esteem of children attending special classes is lower than that of children attending ordinary classes, b) there is an interaction between attending special classes, age and self-esteem, c) there is a positive correlation between academic self-esteem and academic achievement in both groups, and d) the duration of attendance in special classes has an effect on self-esteem. A sample of 291 children participated in the study, 8-12 years old, 238 of them attending ordinary classes and 53 attending both ordinary and special classes of Greek public elementary schools. The self-esteem was measured with the Culture-Free Self-Esteem Inventory for Children, Form B (Battle, 1981) and the academic achievement was based on the GPA in all subjects. The results showed that academic self-esteem of children, specially of those of 10 and 11 years old, is lower than that of children attending ordinary classes; it was also found a positive correlation between academic self-esteem and academic achievement in both groups, while duration of attendance in special classes has no effect on self-esteem.

AB  - Objective: Exploring differences in behavioral and academic progress between children displaying substantive ADHD behaviors (M age of 9.4 years) in special schools (n = 38) and in inclusive education (n = 26). The contribution of pedagogical strategies to positive outcomes was also examined. Method: Measurements used were the Teachers' Report Form, the Social Emotional Questionnaire, assessments of academic achievement, and the Pedagogical Methods Questionnaire. Mixed-model ANOVAs and Pearson's correlations were used to analyze the data. Results: Significant progress was found regarding disorder-specific problem behavior and in all academic areas, but no interaction effect was found between time and setting. Correlations indicated that positive behavior reinforcement and emotional support are the pedagogical strategies that contributed most to behavioral adaptation. Conclusion: Children displaying substantive ADHD behaviors in both groups develop equally well in the areas of behavioral and academic functioning where significant progress was found.

AB  - An investigation into friendship skills of pre-school children with specific language impairment was carried out in both mainstream and specialist play settings. Significant differences in onlooker behaviour were found suggesting that the children benefited from observation and information-processing, time within their mainstream play setting. The amount of solitary play behaviour found within the specialist setting supported these findings. Conclusions are drawn for inclusive education and collaborative practice.

AB  - Peer victimization is a serious social problem that can negatively affect a child‘s psychosocial development and school adjustment, and may have lasting effects for victims. Previous studies on peer victimization have suggested that children with disabilities (CWD) are likely to be more frequent targets of peer victimization. This longitudinal study analyzed three waves of data from the Pre-Elementary Education Longitudinal Study data (N = 1,268). Using the child-by-environment model as a conceptual framework, the study examined the prevalence, nature, and pathways between child characteristics, family factors, school factors at Wave 1, peer-relation difficulties at Wave 2, and peer victimization at Wave 3. To account for the complex sampling used in the dataset, statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 10 and included descriptive analyses, cross-tabulations, Pearson correlations, and a path analysis with AMOS 17.0. The findings showed that one quarter to one third of pre-elementary CWD experienced some form of peer victimization in school. Peer victimization increased over the 3-year study period, and there were also substantial rates of multiple victimization among CWD. The path model showed an acceptable fit to the data. Two pathways explained the influence of risk and protective factors for peer victimization among young CWD. First, children‘s environmental factors, such as low family income and spending more time in a special-education classroom setting, were associated with children‘s poor social behaviors, which in turn affected peer-relation difficulties, and increased peer victimization. Second, CWD from low-income families and special-education classroom settings were more likely to have poor language development and social skills, which affected children‘s peer-relation difficulties and increased peer victimization. These results suggest the need to provide bullying prevention and intervention strategies for CWD, which have been previously neglected in the context of school-based bullying prevention and intervention programs. Practical implications include developing programs tailored for CWD from low-income families and special-education classroom settings, providing mental health services for pre-elementary CWD, linking parents to available school and community resources to improve children‘s language and social skills, and promoting polices to enhance social conditions for CWD.

AB  - Positive peer relationships play a significant role in the development of students. They are beneficial for learning and psychological outcomes. This article draws upon an important distinction between the four main themes of social participation (friendships, interactions, peer acceptance and self-perception of social participation) and examines these aspects in inclusive and regular classes. Especially, differences in social participation of students with and without special educational needs (SEN) in inclusive classes and between students without SEN in inclusive and regular classes are examined. In this study, data from 1115 pupils in primary and secondary schools in Austria were analysed, of which 129 were diagnosed as having SEN. The results showed that in inclusive classes, students with SEN had lower scores on all four subthemes of social participation (friendships, interactions, peer acceptance and self-perception of social integration) than students without SEN. Regarding students without SEN, friendships and peer acceptance were significantly higher in inclusive classes than in regular classes. Differences were neither found for gender, nor between primary and secondary school students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The primary purpose of the "Digest of Education Statistics" is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The "Digest" includes a selection of data from both government and private sources, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To qualify for inclusion, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Although the "Digest" contains information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices. In addition to updating many of the statistics that have appeared in previous years, this edition contains new material, including (1) Average base salary for full-time public elementary and secondary school teachers with a bachelor's degree as their highest degree, by years of full-time teaching experience and state; (2) Average base salary for full-time public elementary and secondary school teachers with a master's degree as their highest degree, by years of full-time teaching experience and state; (3) Averaged freshman graduation rates for public secondary schools, by state; (4) Average reading scale scores of 4th- and 8th-graders, by selected student and parent characteristics and school type; (5) Average mathematics scale scores of 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-graders, by selected student and parent characteristics and school type; (6) Average science scale scores and achievement-level results of 4th-, 8th-, and 12th-graders, by selected student characteristics and percentile; (7) Number and percentage of students expelled and suspended from public elementary and secondary schools, by sex, race/ethnicity, and state; (8) Bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees conferred by degree-granting institutions, by field of study; and (9) Current postsecondary education and employment status, wages earned, and living arrangements of special education students out of secondary school up to 4 years, by type of disability. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. The document includes seven chapters: (1) All Levels of Education; (2) Elementary and Secondary Education; (3) Postsecondary Education; (4) Federal Programs for Education and Related Activities; (5) Outcomes of Education; (6) International Comparisons of Education; and (7) Libraries and Educational Technology. Preceding these chapters is an Introduction that provides a brief overview of current trends in American education, which supplements the tabular materials in chapters 1 through 7. An additional 6 tables are included in Appendix A. Appended are: (1) Guide to Sources; (2) Definitions; and (3) Index of Table Numbers. (Contains 29 figures and 427 tables.)

AB  - The education practices followed by the implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 require higher student math and reading scores on state assessments. Most often, new programs are evaluated using group data as a criterion for success and adoption. However, not every special-needs student always benefits from the same program. Based on the logic underlying the conceptual framework of inclusionism that significantly influences current education policies, the purpose of this study was to determine if there was a relationship between participation in both the pull-out and a pilot inclusion model by 10 special education students and their improvement on state assessment scores in reading and math. The importance of assessing the individual child in a new program provided the framework to examine the benefits or drawbacks of these inclusion practices for students with exceptional needs. The research questions focused on patterns of improvement and the differences in the scores for each of the 10 children who experienced two different inclusion models. The scores were analyzed for each student as their own control group beginning at the baseline year 2006/2007, then 2007/2008, and ending in the treatment year 2008/2009. The retrospective single-subject ABB design focused on individual data rather than group statistics and revealed notable findings that would have been masked by a typical group analysis. Results showed the pilot inclusion model was effective for some but not for the entire group of special-needs students. The research contributes to positive social change by supporting the importance of individual student assessment in special-needs inclusion models, encouraging improved inclusion practices for all at risk students, and supporting the philosophy of leaving no individual child behind.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine rates of improvement (ROI) in reading skills and determine whether or not significant interaction and main effects existed when comparing ROIs for students from various skill/performance levels, grade levels, as well as general or special education status. STAR reading assessment and demographic data were obtained from 4,591 third through eighth grade students in one school district consisting of seven elementary and five middle schools in a Midwestern state who were receiving reading instruction within the general curriculum through inclusion classroom environments for the 2015-2016 school years. STAR reading assessment data were examined using ROI (rates of improvement) for 3 benchmark intervals. STAR reading fall performance was used to categorize students into skill/performance groups on the basis of their percentile rankings (PR). Results indicated a significant interaction effect existed on student ROI for reading skill/performance groups and general/special education status. Significant main effects existed when comparing ROIs across various reading skill/performance groups for fall-to-winter and fall-to-spring benchmark intervals. Also, significant main effects existed when comparing ROIs for general and special education students, with general education students earning significantly higher ROIs than special education students for fall-to-winter and fall-to-spring benchmark intervals. Significant main effects also existed when comparing ROIs across various grade levels for all 3 benchmark intervals. Implications for educational research, practice, and policy related to seasonal effects of intervention, predictive validity among skill/performance groups, and the utility of ROI comparisons were discussed.

AB  - School leaders face increased pressure to identify instructional and administrative practices that increase student achievement. However, achievement gaps persist between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged student groups. This study highlighted relationships between ability grouping and academic achievement in a suburban school district. Thorndike's social intelligence framework proffered learning as a social process and provided a theoretical framework. Research questions addressed whether ability grouping impacted academic achievement of students with special needs, English language learners, and the economically disadvantaged based upon Grade 5 Pennsylvania System of School Assessment mathematics data, Grade 5 mathematics 4Sight data, and Grade 5 enVisionMATH benchmark data. Four independent-samples t tests, 3 chi-square analyses, and 2 point-biserial correlation analyses determined statistically significant differences between student achievement and class placement and rejected 4 of 9 null hypotheses. The current study resulted in a project in the form of a white paper. The white paper included an overview of ability grouping and district assessment data, and recommended a district discussion around ability grouping and alternate grouping structures targeted at increasing student achievement. Implications for local and broader social change included potential elimination of ability grouping for mathematics instruction; reduced inequity of educational opportunities; and decreased achievement gaps between students with special needs, English language learners, and students who are economically disadvantaged compared to students not in these groups.

AB  - Lack of progress of children with emotional disturbance (ED) has begun to be documented in longitudinal school-based studies. Variability in these studies may be due to several factors, including widespread differences in academic, behavioral, and social functioning of these children, their special education status, and school contextual factors. In this study, 86 children were followed over a two-year period: children were drawn from three subgroups-children with ED receiving special education in low-income schools, children with ED receiving special education services in high-income schools, and children not receiving special education services but who were considered high risk for ED. Outcome measures included reading and math achievement along with ratings of behavioral progress. Despite initial differences in overall functioning, there was, almost without exception, no significant progress in any of the three subgroups over the course of a full academic year. This lack of progress was not related to the type of special education and related services that students received in self-contained or full inclusion programs. Results and implications are discussed regarding lack of response of children with or at risk for ED to intervention in both general and special education.

AB  - This study is investigated the attitudes of students in regular placements and students classified LD, ED, and EMD. The Survey of Reading Attitudes (SRA) and the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scales (FSAS-R) were administered to 215 students in grades 4, 5, 6, and 7 of two school districts in the southeastern United States. Significant placement differences were obtained between special education students and students in regular placements. When compared to students in regular placements, EMD students showed significant differences on the subscales Expressed Reading Difficulty and Comics of the SRA. They expressed greater reading difficulty and enjoyment of comics materials. LD students were significantly different from students in regular placements on the subscales Alternative Learning Modes, Reading Anxiety, and Comics. LD students preferred other methods of learning as an alternative to reading, they experienced more anxiety when engaged in reading oriented tasks, and they expressed greater enjoyment of comics materials. Mathematics attitudes of students in EMD placements were significantly different from students in regular placements on the subscales Teacher Factors, Mother factors, Mathematics Anxiety, and Mathematics Usefulness. ED students were significantly different from students in regular placements on the subscale Teacher Factors. Taken together, reading attitudes of students in EMD and LD placements were significantly different from students in regular placements and mathematics attitudes of EMD and ED students were significantly different from their non-identified peers. The most compelling results were obtained for students in EMD placements. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - One of the most powerful variables for students with disabilities success is effective instructional teaching practices. In order to accommodate disabled students in the general education setting, many schools have implemented co-teaching, an inclusive service delivery option that allows teachers to meet the academic needs of students with disabilities within a general education setting. Over the course of 40 years in co-teaching research, many studies have been qualitative in nature and provide minimal quantitative evidence to illustrate the academic impact of co-teaching on 21st century learners who have a disability. Based on a review of the literature, research findings demonstrate a need for more quantitative evidence using standardized assessment data, to determine whether co-teaching adds academic value to high schools students with disabilities. This quantitative study fills a current gap in the research by identifying academic gains of co-teaching to high school students with disabilities compared to high school students with disabilities who are not in a co-taught setting. Three hundred sixty-seven high school students with disabilities comprised of the total sample under study, 37 (10%) of whom were co-taught and 330 of whom were not co-taught. Standardized assessments such as the California Standards Test and California Modified Assessment were used to evaluate the academic value of co-teaching for both groups of students as measured by scale score gains and losses for all students with disabilities. The data indicated that given the small and limited sample size, co-teaching is statistically significant for particular groups of high school students with disabilities. Students with Autism, students who have Other Health Impairments, students who are non English Language Learners and students who are White are amongst the groups where co-teaching is statistically significant. Additional quantitative studies are needed in addressing how co-teaching impacts English Language Learners, Free and Reduced Lunch learners, Hispanic/Latino students and female students with disabilities. When students with disabilities participate in a co-taught class, standardized scale scores indicate co-teaching provided a 3.65 scale score percentage gain versus non co-taught students who had a -2.26 scale score percentage decline. Based on the evidence of findings, co-teaching assisted in closing the academic achievement gap for high school students with disabilities. Given these preliminary quantitative results, co-teaching appears to be a promising, effective instructional model and option for meeting the needs of high school students with disabilities.

AB  - The present quasi-experimental study used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to investigate whether the Instructional Consultation (IC) Team model differentially influences fourth and fifth grade state reading achievement test scores, and English Language Learner (ELL) student scores in particular. Correlations among student-, classroom-, and school-level variables and special education placement were also explored using HLM. Archival data from 11 IC Teams 'treatment' schools and 17 nonequivalent 'control' schools in a mid-Atlantic state were analyzed in both students-within-schools and classrooms-within-schools multilevel models, with appropriate controls specified for classroom and school compositional effects. Although students-within-schools HLM models of reading achievement were not significant, classrooms-within-schools models indicated that classrooms in IC Teams schools had significantly higher class average reading achievement test scores (ES = .36) compared to classrooms in control schools. Neither the students-within-schools nor classrooms-within-schools HLM models found IC Teams to differentially influence reading achievement for ELL students. In addition, classrooms-within-schools results indicate that classrooms in general and classrooms with higher percentages of ELL students tended to have lower percentages of students placed in special education in IC Teams schools. The presence of significant effects at the classroom level may indicate that the classroom is a better unit of analysis for investigating the effectiveness of the IC Team model during the first two to three years of implementation, when its greatest impact may be on teacher, as opposed to student, improvement. Despite its limitations, the present study represents the most rigorous investigation of the effect of IC Teams on student reading achievement to date, and serves as a foundation for future research using HLM to investigate the effects of the IC Team model on student and classroom outcomes.

AB  - This article explores the recent policy concerning the education of disabled children and young people, and the debate of special education versus mainstream inclusion propelled by Warnock. It argues that the formal and informal practices, designed by non-disabled adults, to facilitate the inclusion of disabled students in mainstream schools may be very similar to those which disabled students perceive as barriers to their full participation in mainstream education. This article presents empirical evidence, divided into three themes, to emphasise disabled children's individual perceptions and experiences of mainstream and special school, as well as their preferences towards both. In so doing, it suggests that disabled children are not a homogeneous group and constructing them as such often overlooks the diversity and richness of their everyday lives. Further, it highlights the importance of including disabled children and young people in developing policy that impacts their lives. Reprinted by permission of Routledge, Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - The main research goal was to investigate the self-concept, self-esteem and social support among adolescents with special needs, concentrating on the differences between adolescents who are attending regular schools and those who receive their education in special institutions. Participants filled in three questionnaires: Self-description Questionnaire (Marsh, 1992), Self-Liking/Competence Scale (Tafarodi and Swann, 2001) and Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (Malecki, Demaray and Elliott, 2000). The results show that the educational institution and type of disability affect students 'self-concept, self-esteem and social support, while parents 'disability only has a minor influence on these characteristics. Positive correlations between types of self-concept and social support can also be observed. The results therefore show inclusion's positive effect on students' personal and social functioning: students attending inclusive education have better self-concepts and receive more social support than students attending special schools.

AB  - This study used a statewide longitudinal sample to examine mathematics achievement gaps and growth in students with and without disabilities and to examine the impact of different methods of determining disability group membership on achievement gaps and growth. When disability status was determined on the basis of special education placement each year, the achievement gap was larger across grades than when the subgroup of students with disabilities (SWDs) was defined more broadly, including students who had exited special education or who were in special education anytime between Grades 3 and 7. Regardless of the identification criteria, the SWD subgroup showed lower average achievement and slower growth than students without disabilities. The results suggest that the present way of identifying the SWD subgroup in reporting achievement outcomes may be biased and that even students who exit special education continue to be at risk for lower mathematics achievement.

AB  - Many states now use large-scale testing programs as a major mechanism in their educational accountability efforts. With the mandated participation of students with disabilities in large-scale testing programs. ii is possible to use large-scale testing results to examine special education efficacy at the school level. We used special and general education reading outcomes from 6 elementary schools in 1 school district to compare and contrast measures of a school's performance over time in serving children with disabilities. Three different methods were contrasted: (a) percentage of students in special education reaching grade-level proficiency in reading each year, (b) percentage of students in special education exceeding expected growth in reading each year, and (c) longitudinal growth and percentage of students reaching grade-level proficiency in 5th grade. We discuss the results in terms of deriving a measure of school special education performance chat is both accurate and useful for school personnel.

AB  - Examined effects of social integration on social, emotional and achievement-motivational characteristics of 121 4th grade students with and without learning disabilities in 2 different settings: fully integrated regular and full-time special education classrooms. The results show that the self-reported social, emotional, and achievement-motivational scores of students with learning disabilities is lower than those of a normal control group, and that students attending full-time special education classes attained better scores on these measures than students with learning disabilities attending regular classes. It is concluded that poor social and emotional outcomes for students with learning disabilities in the regular classes suggests that successful integration requires encouraging and developing interactions and communication in the classroom, offering professional assistance, as well as creating individualized education programs and training teachers for integration.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine the relationship between special education programs, ethnicity and socioeconomics on student growth in reading and math over a three-year period for students in both integrated co-taught and self-contained settings. This quantitative study looked at the differences in student growth on Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) in reading and math for 65 students who had been educated in an integrated co-taught classroom for three years, and compared that growth to students who had been educated in self contained classrooms for the same amount of time, noting any significant differences and/or demographic influencers. Within this research, students educated in integrated placements made more growth than those in self-contained placements in both reading and math. However, when looking at program in comparison with demographic variables, free and reduced lunch, rather than program or ethnicity, was generally a better predictor of student growth in reading. In mathematics, program, rather than ethnicity or the demographic variable of free and reduced lunch, was the stronger predictor of growth. However, the strength of the relationship between program and growth decreased each year and the descriptive statistics clearly demonstrated that the students in self-contained programs were making gains in mathematics. Although the initial research hypothesis did identify demographics as the stronger correlate, the role of ethnicity was not significant throughout the study.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the achievement scores in reading/language arts and math of fourth and fifth grade special education learning-disabled students who received academic instruction in an inclusion classroom or a pull-out classroom. Student achievement scores from the 2012-2013 Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) and the Discovery Education Assessment (DEA) improvement scores were compared with regard to service location and analyzed for significant differences between the locations: inclusion and pull-out classrooms. A quantitative study was used to find the differences in reading/language arts and math achievement scores for fourth and fifth grade special education learning-disabled students in an East Tennessee school district. Eleven research questions guided the study. The results of the analyses indicated significant differences in reading/language arts and math scores between the groups in all but 2 analyses. The inclusion students scored higher than the pull-out students. The fourth grade inclusion students scored significantly higher than the fourth grade pull-out students in TCAP reading/language arts, TCAP math, and DEA math but scored with similar results in DEA reading/language arts. The fifth grade inclusion students scored significantly higher than the fifth grade pull-out students in TCAP reading/language arts, TCAP math, and DEA reading/language arts but scored with similar results in DEA math. This study supported the idea that learning-disabled students receiving academic instruction in an inclusion classroom score significantly higher on achievement tests than the students who received their instruction in the pull-out classroom.

AB  - Purpose: Following recent federal legislation and related policy changes, co-teaching evolved rapidly as a strategy to provide students with disabilities access to the same curriculum as students without disabilities while receiving instruction in the least restrictive environment. It is unclear if co-teaching is an effective instructional strategy for educating students with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. The purpose of this causal-comparative study was to determine if there was a significant difference in students with disabilities' academic performance in co-taught versus traditional classrooms. Methodology: This causal-comparative study examined the effects of co-teaching on California students with disabilities' performance on the Smarter Balanced assessments. Data were collected from 3 school districts representing 10 comprehensive high schools; 641 test results from the spring 2016 Smarter Balanced assessments of 11th-grade students with disabilities from co-taught and traditional classrooms in English and mathematics were compared using an independent samples t test. Findings: Analysis of the 641 Smarter Balanced test results produced the following findings: (a) students with disabilities primarily receive instruction in the traditional classroom; (b) in co-taught classrooms, students' primary disability was typically a specific learning disability; (c) t-test results indicated a significant difference in English test scores for students receiving English instruction in co-taught versus traditional classrooms; (d) t-test results indicated no significant difference in mathematics scores for students receiving mathematics instruction in co-taught versus traditional classrooms. Conclusions: There is a statistically significant difference in the academic achievement of students in English. While performing lower than students with disabilities in traditional classrooms, students with disabilities in co-taught classrooms received access to the grade-level curriculum in the least restrictive environment. No statistically significant difference in the academic achievement of students in mathematics was noted, suggesting students with disabilities are performing similarly in mathematics regardless of instructional setting. Recommendations: It is recommended additional research focuses on the academic achievement of students with disabilities in multiple settings, traditional, co-taught, and special education classrooms, to identify potential variations in achievement related to instructional setting. Additional research may determine the instructional setting's impact on students' attitude toward learning, relationships with teachers, or other social-emotional factors.

AB  - The literature on the neuropsychology of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is plagued by inconsistent findings, which are usually attributed to a variety of extraneous variables. One of the most inadequately explored of these variables is the difference between ADHD children attending remedial and mainstream schools. This study aimed to investigate whether the performance of remedial and mainstream school ADHD boys differs on relevant neuropsychological tasks. The sample consisted of three groups of 8- to 12-year-old boys. Two of these groups consisted of children with ADHD: one from remedial schools and one from mainstream schools. The third group was made up of participants without ADHD, who attended mainstream schools. The performance of the remedial school learners on the Stroop, Lurian and cancellation tasks was investigated and compared to a mainstream school ADHD sample. The performance of the ADHD group as a whole was compared with that of a control group. No significant difference in performance was found between the two ADHD groups, except for the length of time taken to read words in the control condition of the Stroop. The control group out-performed the ADHD samples on the Stroop, Lurian and cancellation tasks. The findings suggest that mainstream and remedial ADHD boys do not differ in the severity of their executive deficits, but that boys with ADHD attending remedial schools may be more likely to have another learning disorder than their counterparts at mainstream schools.

AB  - The integration of inclusion as an accepted instructional arrangement has undergone many challenges related to students with special needs being placed in general education classrooms. As the population of students with special needs increases in inclusion settings, various instructional arrangements have been formed to support least restrictive environments. Inclusion is an instructional arrangement defined as full or partial. The purpose of this quantitative study was to investigate the difference between full or partial inclusion and the subsequent academic achievement of students with disabilities as measured by performance on the State of Texas Academic Assessment of Readiness (STAAR) ninth-grade English language arts (ELA) end-of-course (EOC) exam. The cohort of students was purposively selected based on the commonalities they shared; namely, qualifying to receive specially designed instruction and services in either full or partial inclusion instructional arrangements. In an inclusion classroom, general and special education teachers collaborate to provide instruction to all students. Students with special needs had access to the same curriculum. The researcher examined the percentage of time students with special needs received instruction in full and partial inclusion classrooms to determine if differences existed between student performance scores. No significant difference exists on the academic performance of students with special needs between those in full inclusion and those in partial inclusion classroom settings as measured by scores on the STAAR ninth-grade ELA EOC exam.

AB  - Introduction Children with hearing impairments have some difficulties on learning social and moral rules because of lack of hearing competencies (Luetke- Stahlman and Luckner, 2000). Akçamete (2005) emphasized that the process in learning of social skills for hearing impaired children is dependent upon their communication skills which can be learnt by hearing and hearing impaired students in the same way due to the fact that they follow same basic principles. If hearing impaired children's language development does not improve at the expected level when they even grow old they may have many difficulties to communicate with the same age hearing peers. In addition, language development is important factor to have friendships amongst older hearing impaired students. Social rule knowledge is also important role for the hearing impaired to be able to learn behaviour patterns. Poyraz-Tüy (1999) reported that hearing impaired students who are enrolled in special schools had more inner intentional problems such as social withdrawn, anxiety, depressive reflections and psychosomatic problems than hearing impaired students have who are enrolled in inclusive schools. However, when their practice skills on doing social rules are improved their behaviour problems can be decreased. In other words, when hearing impaired students' knowledge on social and moral rules increase the level of problem behaviours may be reduced in the same level. In Turkey, there are some researches about hearing impaired students which are related to the effects of different approaches or teaching methods to teach social skills to them (Avcioğlu, 2001 and Onalan-Akfirat, 2004) or related to elucidating their problem behaviors (Poyraz-Tüy, 1999). However, there is not research regarding social and moral rules knowledge the students with hearing impairments have. Therefore, this research examines whether social and moral rules knowledge of hearing impaired students differ according to their education settings, mainstream and special schools, in terms of some different variables such as school types, gender and their grades. Method This research aims to elucidate whether there is any difference on social and moral rules knowledge between inclusive and special school students with hearing impairments in terms of their school type, gender and their grades. Therefore, the structured interview method was used to describe social and moral rules knowledge that they have in this study. Study Group In this study, the study group consists of 79 hearing impaired students who are enrolled in special and inclusive schools, 41 students from special schools (9-13 years old with 65-115 decibels), and 38 schools from 11 mainstream schools (9-13 years old and 35-95 decibels). The research Instruments In this research, the researcher used the Scale of Preschool Children's Knowledge on Social and Moral Rules developed by Smetana (1981) which consists of ten pictures. Smetana (1981) reported that the reliability of the scale was .76 accounted with the Pearson's Correlation Technique. The reason why this scale was used in this study is because this scale consists of ten pictures and many questions with each picture which gives clear reflections on the perceptions of hearing impaired students due to the fact that the pictures are audio-visual which is important for these students to be able to understand clearly about what the pictures explain to respond. In Turkey, the study for reliability and validity of the scale was completed by Seçer and Sari (2006), and the validity and the reliability calculations were renewed before the scale was used for this study because the study group included hearing impaired students only. Pointing The study groups were showed three different faces for each picture to learn what the students' perceptions are about the seriousness of social and moral rules.… (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Bazı işitme engelli öğrencilerin işitme kayıpları nedeniyle sosyal ve etik gelişimlerinde geri kalmalarına rağmen, bu öğrencilerin sosyal ve etik kurallarla ilgili gelişimlerine yönelik ülkemizdeki araştırmaların sınırlı olduğu gözlenmektedir. Buna ek olarak, kaynaştırma ortamlarında ve özel eğitim okulunda öğrenim gören işitme engelli öğrencilerin sosyal ve etik kurallara yönelik bilgileriyle ilgili karşılaştırmalı araştırmaların da sınırlı olduğu görülmektedir. Bu nedenle, bu araştırmanın amacı, 1) kaynaştırma ortamlarında ve özel eğitim okulunda öğrenim gören işitme engelli öğrencilerin sosyal ve etik kurallarla ilgili bilgilerinin farklılaşıp farklılaşmadığının ve 2) sosyal ve etik kurallarla ilgili bilgilerinin öğrenim gördükleri farklı ortamlardan etkilenip etkilenmediğinin karşılaştırmalı olarak incelenmesidir. Bu araştırmanın yöntemi 'Görüşme Yöntemi'dir Bu araştırmaya, özel eğitim okulundan 41 ve kaynaştırma sınıflarından da 38 öğrenci olmak üzere toplam 79 öğrenci katılmıştır. Araştırmada veri toplamak amacıyla Smetana (1981) tarafından geliştirilen 10 resim araştırmacı tarafından Türkçeye uyarlanarak kullanılmıştır. Bu araştırmada elde edilen veriler Mann-Whitney U ve t testi kullanılarak analiz edilmiştir. Bu araştırmadan ortaya çıkan bulgular aşağıda sıralanmıştır. Özet bölümünde maddeler yerine sonuçları kısaltıp yazılması daha iyi olur. Özel eğitim okulunda öğrenim gören işitme engelli öğrencilerin, kaynaştırma ortamlarında öğrenim gören işitme engelli öğrencilere göre etik ve sosyal kurallarla ilgili (otorite yokluğu, kural yokluğu, genelleme ve ceza) alt boyut puanlarının daha yüksek olduğunu, Etik ve sosyal kural bilgisinin cinsiyete göre karşılaştırıldığında, puanlar arasında kız öğrencilerin lehine anlamlı farklılıklar olduğu, Sınıf düzeylerine göre karşılaştırıldığında ise, özel eğitim okulunda öğrenim gören işitme engelli öğrencilerin lehine kaynaştırma ortamlarında öğrenim gören işitme engelli çocukların etik ve sosyal kural bilgisi puanlarında anlamlı farklılıklar olduğu ortaya çıkmıştır. Bulgular alanyazın ışığında tartışılmıştır.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to compare the reading and math performance levels relative to whether there was statistical significance in the mean scores of special education students if they were in inclusive settings or non-inclusive settings. The inclusive setting was defined as special education students who are kept in a regular classroom for nearly the entire day. The non-inclusive setting was defined as those special education students who are not part of a regular education classroom setting, but are with a special educator who teaches them their academic subjects along with a teacher's assistant. This study focused on three independent variables to conduct data analysis. The three variables of settings, race, and gender were closely examined to ascertain whether they impact the academic performance of the identified students in this study. A major issue in this study was the elements of inclusive techniques that have been researched by many scholars. To provide a balance in the debate of which settings benefit these students, there was also much discussion of research on arguments against inclusion. There is much evidence on both issues to make educators pause and reflect on what are best practices to assist students with identified disabilities as they strive to provide a free and appropriate education for these children. Statistical measures used in this study included t-tests for reading and math mean scores for the three grade levels along with the two and three-way ANOVA to determine the factors of gender and race. The results indicated that in third grade there were no statistical differences in the mean scores of the two groups. Fourth grade results indicated that there were no significant differences in the reading mean scores of the two groups; however, there was statistical significance in the math mean scores of the two groups. Fifth grade results yielded statistical significance in the math and reading mean scores of the two groups relative to the race factor. Three-way ANOVA results revealed that there was statistical significance with the interaction of race and gender for third grade special education students relative to math and reading scale scores. The mixed results support much of the research that has been conducted relative to the benefits of inclusive settings on the academic performance of students with disabilities.

AB  - The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142) states that children with disabilities have a right to education in the least restricted environment. This law sparked a movement toward a full inclusive educational program that would provide the best environment for the learning of both students with special needs and typically achieving students (Banerji & Dailey, 1995). Students with special needs have also shown improvements in social relations and social acceptance when placed in an inclusion classroom compared to pullout (Madge, et al., 1990). Academic gains have also been found (Banerji & Dailey, 1995). A great deal of research has been conducted to support the value of inclusion for students with special needs (Madge, et al., 1990; Bear & Minke, 1996; Juvonen & Beam, 1992; Madden & Slavin, 1983). Little research, however, has identified the impact on regular education students. It was anticipated that the supportive environment provided by the inclusion model would also produce benefits for regular education students. The present study examined the impact of an inclusion program on children's self-perceptions, social skills, social problem-solving skills, and academic performance. It was predicted that regular education students, in addition to the special education students who are placed in an inclusion classroom setting, would show greater benefits from that placement compared with those in a regular education classroom setting. Data were collected on 525 4th and 5th grade students consisting of 65 special education students and 460 regular education students. Assessment of self-perception, social skills, and social problem-solving skills were obtained using student self-report measures. Academic achievement was obtained through report card grades. Significant differences were found on measures of scholastic competence, social skills, and academic achievement between the regular education students in inclusion and the regular education students in the regular education classrooms. Significant differences were also found between the special education students and the regular education students on certain measures of self-perception, social skills, and social problem-solving skills. Other measures produced comparable results between the two groups. Results of this study were discussed including the relative benefits of inclusion for all children.

AB  - Bullying experiences and self-reported anxiety about bullying and were compared in 72 elementary and middle school students including 16 in self contained (SC) special education classes, 20 receiving resource or consultation (RC), and 36 matched peers. Individually administered Bully Victimization Scale and School Violence Anxiety Scale scores (Reynolds, 2003) revealed that children with special needs (both SC & RC) tended to report more peer victimization and higher anxiety about school violence than matched peers from the same schools. Placement was not related to self-reported bullying experiences. Students in self-contained classes were significantly more anxious about possible bullying, especially physical, in spite of being in more protected environments. School placement is an important but under-researched issue in assessment and intervention for bullying of students receiving special education services.

AB  - This review of the literature addresses key considerations in the friendships of children with intellectual disabilities and is organized into four areas of friendship: perceptions, sports, social skills training, and setting effects. The study found that children with disabilities view their social relationships with peers favorably, despite the limited quantity of such relationships. Additionally, children with disabilities have limited access to peers and have limited skills in establishing friendships. Results suggest that children with disabilities would benefit from more exposure to peers in all settings. Other findings include: students with intellectual disabilities in mainstreamed schools tended to have more friends than similar students in special schools; participation in sports improved the self-esteem and friendship activity for students with intellectual disabilities; children with disabilities have very little contact with peers outside of school; training in social skills increased the number of social interactions (mostly positive) for children with disabilities; and peer training in social skills is the most effective.

AB  - Background: In the debate on inclusive education, students without special educational needs (SEN) are an important topic. However, there is a lot unknown about differences between these typical students in inclusive and non-inclusive classes. For example, the neutral results that are often found in earlier research could be caused by positive effects for some students, and negative effects for others. Purpose: This study investigated whether there is a relation between inclusive education and the academic achievement and socio-emotional functioning of typical students, and, more importantly, whether inclusive education affects the achievement and socio-emotional functioning of more and less intelligent typical students differently. Furthermore, we investigated whether differences occur by type of SEN of the included students. Here, we made a distinction between students with behavioural, cognitive and other problems. Sample: A representative sample of 27,745 students without SEN in Dutch primary education from a large cohort study in the Netherlands was used. Design and methods: Language and arithmetic tests were used to assess academic achievement. For socio-emotional functioning, both teacher and student questionnaires were used. A non-verbal IQ test was used to assess student intelligence. Based on the number of students with diagnosed SEN, the students without SEN were divided into several groups: typical students with no, a few and more than a few students with (certain types of) SEN in their class. Multi-level regression analyses were used to compare these groups. Results: For academic achievement, no differences were found between students without SEN in inclusive and non-inclusive classes. In this, we found no differences between intelligent and less intelligent typical students. For socio-emotional functioning, some differences were found, but the practical importance of these differences is unclear, since the effect sizes were small. The functioning of typical students does not meaningfully differ by type of SEN of the included students. Conclusions: The findings of this study are interesting in the light of the ongoing inclusion debate. Arguments against inclusive education often concern an assumed adverse effect on typical students. As in this study, hardly any differences were found between typical students in inclusive and non-inclusive primary school classes, this research strengthens the scientific evidence in support of inclusive education.

AB  - The purpose of this study was two-fold: (a) to examine the influence of student- and school-level demographic, economic, academic, and behavioral variables measured in the third grade on a student’s probability of not receiving special education services in the fifth grade and (b) to examine the differences among students who have received special education services and then exit out of special education, students who remain in special education, and students who never received special education services. Variables were selected from kindergarten, third, and fifth grade data from the restricted ECLS-K dataset and the dependent variable was the dichotomous variable of whether or not a student was in receipt of special education services as recorded by the field management supervisor for ECLS-K. Prior to conducting the analyses, the appropriate cross-sectional or panel weight was applied; therefore, all results are nationally representative of students who began kindergarten in the 1998-1999 school year. Descriptive statistics and HGLM analysis were used in this study to address each of the research questions. Results of descriptive analyses indicate that among third graders, minority students were overrepresented in special education programs, were from lower SES backgrounds, had lower reading and mathematics scores, and had lower approaches to learning scores and higher externalizing behavior scores compared to White students. Likewise, a higher percentage of minority students attended poorer schools and schools with lower average academic achievement scores. Further, findings from the HGLM analysis indicate that SES and mathematics achievement measured in the third grade were key predictors to receipt of special education services in the fifth grade. HGLM results suggest that race/ethnicity is not a significant predictor of receipt of special education services in the fifth grade. Results of this study illuminate the need for additional studies that focus on analysis at the individual student- and school-level and the importance of disaggregating data not only by race/ethnicity and disability type but also for SES but also when services were received.

AB  - Children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be vulnerable to social isolation and bullying. We measured the friendship, fighting/bullying and victimization experiences of 10-12-year-old children with an ASD (N = 100) using parent, teacher and child self-report. Parent and teacher reports were compared to an IQ-matched group of children with special educational needs (SEN) without ASD (N = 80) and UK population data. Parents and teachers reported a lower prevalence of friendships compared to population norms and to children with SEN without an ASD. Parents but not teachers reported higher levels of victimization than the SEN group. Half of the children with an ASD reported having friendships that involved mutuality. By teacher report children with an ASD who were "less" socially impaired in mainstream school experienced "higher" levels of victimization than more socially impaired children; whereas for more socially impaired children victimization did not vary by school placement. Strategies are required to support and improve the social interaction skills of children with an ASD, to enable them to develop and maintain meaningful peer friendships and avoid victimization.

AB  - Bullying and victimisation remains a pervasive problem within the nation's schools. International research has indicated that students who are enrolled in special education curricula are victimised and perpetrate more bullying than their general education peers. Few empirical studies have examined bullying and victimisation rates among American schoolchildren within special education programmes. The current study examined rates of bullying and fighting perpetration and victimisation among middle-school students (n = 7331) and high-school students (n = 14,315) enrolled in general education and special education programmes. As hypothesised, students in special education reported greater rates of bullying and fighting perpetration, and victimisation than general education students. Students who were in self-contained classrooms reported more perpetration and victimisation than those in inclusive settings. Fighting perpetration was similar for younger and older students in special education settings, whereas fighting perpetration was lower for older students, versus younger students, in general education.

AB  - For most of U.S. History, schools were allowed to-and often did-exclude certain children, especially children with disabilities. However, in the 1960s, federal legislation began to address the educational needs of children with disabilities, culminating in the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Shapiro, 1993). However, educating children with disabilities full time, side by side with those students without disabilities created debates and problems for many. Therefore, this quasi-experimental research study collected data for 6 weeks utilizing district-wide exams and the Student Self-Concept Scale (SSCS) to identify which program: inclusion, (students with disabilities are educated side by side with their non-disabled peers) or exclusion (all students with disabilities are educated in an isolated room) was more effective in educating students with mild learning disabilities (LD). Each group consisted of five participants. The analysis of data collection consisted of district-wide exams (literacy and math) using a t test for 2 independent samples to determine the statistical difference of the mean test scores from the 2 educational programs. In addition, analysis and statistics from the subcategories of the test averages also helped confirm the results. The SSCS uses a lie scale, 9 subscales, and 2 composites that result from crossing the 3 rating dimensions (self-confidence, importance, and outcome confidence) with the three content domains (self-image, academic, and social) to determine which LD group had a higher self-concept. The results showed a significant difference between the treatment group (inclusion) and the comparison group (self-contained). The students in the inclusion program achieved higher academic gains than exclusion students; however, the exclusion students scored higher on self-concept than the inclusion students, rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in academics and self-concepts in establishing peer relationships with nondisabled peers among students with LD who are participants in an inclusion program. The results of this study can foster social change among educators who are perplexed with the question of how to educate students with disabilities. This research provides evidence that both programs provide benefits, but future research is required to determine how best to educate the entire student population in both programs. Students learn differently, and having multiple programs to choose from is beneficial. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Against the background of inclusion and a systemic model of disability social integration -- defined as the sociometric position or the (self-)experience of being socially integrated -- is a central requirement for pursuing the highest possible participation under inclusive conditions. Concerning the current tendency toward inclusive school systems resarching the influencing and context-sensitive factors of social integration can lead to results relevant for the prospective practice. Aim: The study investigates how the form of education, 'inclusive' or 'separated', can be identified as a predictor for the self-experienced social identity, i.e. how the form of education has a systematic influence on the degree of self-experienced social integration. Methods: A standardized questionnaire based on the FEESS 1-2 and upgraded with further relevant subjects was handed out to 65 pupils (first till fourth grade) educated at inclusive (49) and special (16) schools. Their teachers or speech therapists were asked about the childrens' speech impediments. The study was conducted in three federal states, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, and Niedersachsen. Results: The involved children from inclusive schools turned out to have a better self-concept of social integration than those from special schools. The form of education could be identified as one of the predictors for the degree of (self-experienced) social integration. Other predictors were the variables 'siblings' and 'class level'. Conclusions: Given these results inclusion might have positive effects on the social integration of children with speech impediments. Due to the fact that relevant variables through which paedogical and educational methods for effectively supporting social integration could be verified were not considered in the study, a further and more intensely examination of the social integration of children in school with speech impediments and its influential factors are essential. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Hintergrund: Vor dem Hintergrund inklusiver Pädagogik und eines systemischen Behindertenbegriffs stellt die soziale Integration -- definiert als soziometrische Stellung oder als soziales Integriertsein auf der Ebene des Selbsterlebens -- einen zentralen Bedingungsfaktor für die größtmögliche Teilhabe und Partizipation der von Behinderung gefährdeten Personengruppen dar. Die nähere Untersuchung von Kontextabhängigkeiten und Einflussfaktoren auf die soziale Integration sprachauffälliger Kinder kann praxisrelevante Ergebnisse für Aspekte des Förderschwerpunkts Sprache in einer inklusiven Schullandschaft liefern. Ziel: Die Studie im Rahmen dieser Arbeit untersucht, inwiefern die Beschulungsformen „inklusiv“ und „separiert“ einen Prädiktor für die selbsterlebte soziale Integration darstellen, inwiefern diese somit das soziale Erleben der Befragten systematisch beeinflussen. Methode: Mittels einer Befragung der betroffenen Kinder mit einem standardisierten Fragebogen auf Grundlage des FEESS 1-2 und einer Befragung der Lehrkräfte bzw. logopädischen Fachkräfte mithilfe eines ebenfalls standardisierten Fragebogens zum sprachlichen Störungsbild der Befragten wurde das Ausmaß der selbsterlebten sozialen Integration von insgesamt 49 inklusiv und 16 separiert beschulten Kindern der ersten bis vierten Klasse aus drei Bundesländern (Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein und Niedersachsen) gemeinsam mit weiteren Variablen erhoben. Ergebnisse: Die selbsteingeschätzte soziale Integration der inklusiv beschulten Befragten war im Durchschnitt positiver als die der separiert beschulten. Die Beschulungsform konnte als ein Prädiktor für das Ausmaß der sozialen Integration bestimmt werden. Weitere Prädiktoren waren die Variable „Geschwister“ sowie die „Klassenstufe“. Schlussfolgerungen: Es ist zunächst anzunehmen, dass die inklusive Beschulung einen positiven Einfluss auf die soziale Integration sprachauffälliger Grundschulkinder hat. Die Nichtberücksichtigung einiger für die Forschungsfrage relevanter Variablen, anhand derer u. a. unterrichtsmethodische und -prozessuale Möglichkeiten gelungener sozialer Integration identifiziert werden könnten, weist auf die Notwendigkeit der weitergehenden und intensiveren Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema der sozialen Integration sprachauffälliger Kinder in der Schule hin.

AB  - Years of research on the effect of inclusive placements on the academic performance of students with disabilities has been notable for its inconsistent and contradictory findings. This study examined the performance of 651 elementary, middle, and high school students with disabilities in a large urban school district in a plains state on state assessments in reading and mathematics. The goal of this analysis was to determine the extent to which the inclusion of students with disabilities in general education classrooms impacts their performance on state assessments. Scores of students taking the general assessment and the modified assessment were included in this study. The dependent variable was each student's reading and mathematics score on the state assessment, and the independent variable was the student's access to general education curriculum as measured by Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) inclusiveness designations. Control variables were selected to test for the effects the individual variables of a student's disability type, race, gender, and socio-economic status, and because students in the data were nested within schools, hierarchical-linear analysis was employed to reduce potential biases due to correlated observations. Finally, the regression models included school-level predictors for building inclusiveness, qualifications of general and special education teachers, and proportions of students with disabilities, students from low-income families, and students of color. The study produced four main findings. First, the student-level variable, OSEP level of inclusion, was a highly significant predictor of increased academic performance on state assessments in both reading and mathematics in every model. Second, the student-level predictor, free/reduced lunch, had a highly significant negative effect on student performance in reading and in mathematics, nearly twice the positive effects of inclusion. Third, the school-level predictor, percent of minority student enrollment of school, had significant negative effect on student performance in mathematics. Finally, the interaction of student OSEP level of inclusion and the school's percent of highly qualified special education teachers had a significant positive effect in mathematics, suggesting that the effect of inclusiveness is amplified by access to a highly qualified teacher in this subject. In terms of the primary question of the effect of inclusive placements on the academic performance of students with disabilities, results indicate that as the student's level of inclusion increases, performance on state assessments improves in both reading and mathematics.

AB  - Since the mid '70s, school districts have been trying to place students with disabilities in the least restricted environment. As governments strive to create a more inclusive society, an inclusive academic setting for students with disabilities has become a priority. The purpose of the study was to examine the impact of academic setting on academic achievement in reading, science, and mathematics among 5th grade students with disabilities. The hypotheses were that 5th graders with disabilities receiving academic instruction in a segregated setting perform differently in reading, science, and mathematics than do those receiving instruction in an inclusive setting. The study utilized an ex post facto, casual-comparative research design. The independent variable was the educational placement with two levels. The segregated level was identified by only the students with disabilities. The comparison level consisted of students with disabilities in the general education setting. The outcome measures were academic achievement in reading, science, and mathematics. The characteristic-present group consisted of a non-probability sample of 20 5th grade students with an instructional arrangement code of 42; indicating 21% to less than 50% of the academic school day is spent in a special education setting, receiving direct instruction from a special education teacher. The comparison group consisted of 50 5th grade students with an instructional arrangement code of 40; indicating 0% of the academic school day is spent in a special education setting. Due to the non-experimental nature of the study, no causal inferences were drawn. Due to the non-probability nature of the sampling technique, external validity was limited to the study's participants. After adjusting the data on the basis of gender, which was a confounding variables, it was concluded that academic achievement in reading and mathematics was not impacted by academic setting. Academic achievement in science was impacted by the intervention and favored the inclusive setting. All effect sizes were meaningful and favored the inclusive setting. A series of power analysis showed that the small sample of the subjects in the characteristic-present group could have contributed to the lack of statistical significance in the findings. It was also concluded that gender must be taken into consideration in designing instructional settings for children with disabilities. Students with disabilities, who are receiving special education services, are not only held accountable for the same academic standards within the academic setting, but are also held accountable for meeting state standards on the STAAR assessments. The results of the study may provide an understanding of what adjustments need to be made to be sure students with disabilities are receiving the best education possible.

AB  - The current study examined the impact of school placement in mainstream or special settings on the behavioural functioning of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Children were assessed at the start of the school year and then again at the end of the school year using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. Children with ASD made improvements in both types of placements; however, those children in specialist provisions made greater improvements in areas of conduct and socialisation. These results confirm other recent demonstrations of superior performance in special schools for children with ASD. The need to re-address specialist school placement as a viable alternative to mainstream education for children with ASD is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research study investigated the effectiveness of full inclusion on the academic achievement of students with disabilities in grades 3-6 in the DeKalb County Schools in Tennessee over a three-year period. The dependent variables in the study were students' reading/language and math achievement test scores. Independent variables in the study were gender, socioeconomic level, and school attendance. The research involved three schools and a total of 107 students. Eighty-seven students were involved in the inclusion program and 20 students continued to receive support services in a pullout resource program. Fifteen students in the inclusion group continued to receive pullout reading instruction for 50 minutes per day. Only students identified as having a primary disability of learning disabled, mentally retarded, language impaired, seriously emotionally disturbed, or health impaired were included in the study. A causal-comparative research design using quantitative data was implemented in this study. The study consisted of nine null hypotheses. Students' Norm Curve Equivalent scores were used and statistical significance was determined by utilizing the unpaired t-test, the two-way ANOVA, and the Mann-Whitney U-test at the .05 level of significance. Statistical significance was found for socioeconomic status on the math and reading/language achievement of students who received extra reading instruction. There were no statistically significant differences found for math and reading/language scores for students in the inclusion program and students in the pullout resource program based on students' gender, socioeconomic status, and school attendance. Recommendations for the education profession included professional development for teachers, implementation of additional programs for remediation and support, programs to involve parents in their child's education, and more course offerings in special education at the university level. Recommendations for further research included ways to close academic achievement gaps, the effects of inclusion on the social aspect and perception of teachers and students, and research in other geographical areas.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the discriminant validity of the Devereux Scales of Mental Disorders (DSMD; Naglieri, LeBuffe, & Pfeiffer, 1994) in relation to a widely used behavior rating scale, the Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach, 1991), in children and adolescents with emotional disturbance (ED). A matched sample of 148 children and adolescents, 74 in regular education and 74 in special education settings for ED, were rated by teachers using the DSMD and TRF. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) analyses and d-ratios yielded statistically significant differences (p < .01) between groups and moderate to large effect sizes. Receiver operator characteristic analyses indicated that in general the TRF produced higher area under the curve (AUC) estimates than the DSMD across age groups for the total and composite scale scores. Classification efficiency statistics at the recommended cutoff T-score of 60 for the total scale revealed that the DSMD performed as well as the TRF. Results generalized well across base rates, with the DSMD producing slightly higher positive predictive power than the TRF, and the TRF exhibiting a greater negative predictive power than the DSMD.

AB  - Background and Aim: Children with severe and profound hearing loss have difficulties in communicating with others and educating at school. Effects of learning environment on children's language skills have been recently focused and educating those students in ordinary schools has been proposed. According to this view, we compared perception of antonyms and synonyms as a semantic aspect of language in students of ordinary, integrated and special schools. Methods: It was an analytic cross-sectional study. Three groups of students were enrolled: normal-hearing students of ordinary schools and hearing-loss students of integrated and specials schools. Each group consisted of 25 students in fifth grade of elementary schools in Tehran city. Two written tests were used. Subjects wrote synonyms and antonyms for each word in the tests. Results: Results denoted significant differences between scores of normal-hearing and hearing-loss students and also between hearing-loss students of integrated schools and hearing-loss students of special schools (p<0.05). In all three groups of the students, perception of antonyms was better than antonyms (p<0.001). Speech processing rate in normal-hearing students were higher than both groups of hearing-loss students (p<0.001). Conclusion: The differences between normal-hearing and hearing-loss students shows that similar to other language skills, perception of synonyms and antonyms as a semantic aspect of speech is related to the hearing conditions and type of education. Moreover, the differences between two groups of hearing-loss students represent that speech stimulants and interaction with normal-hearing children could improve semantic aspect of speech in hearing-loss students.

AB  - Background: Students with early-starting conduct problems often do poorly in school; they are disproportionately placed in restrictive educational placements outside of mainstream classrooms. Although intended to benefit students, research suggests that restrictive placements may exacerbate the maladjustment of youth with conduct problems. Mixed findings, small samples, and flawed designs limit the utility of existing research. Methods: This study examined the impact of restrictive educational placements on three adolescent outcomes (high school noncompletion, conduct disorder, depressive symptoms) in a sample of 861 students with early-starting conduct problems followed longitudinally from kindergarten (age 5-6). Causal modeling with propensity scores was used to adjust for confounding factors associated with restrictive placements. Analyses explored the timing of placement (elementary vs. secondary school) and moderation of impact by initial problem severity. Results: Restrictive educational placement in secondary school (but not in elementary school) was iatrogenic, increasing the risk of high school noncompletion and the severity of adolescent conduct disorder. Negative effects were amplified for students with conduct problem behavior with less cognitive impairment. Conclusions: To avoid harm to students and to society, schools must find alternatives to restrictive placements for students with conduct problems in secondary school, particularly when these students do not have cognitive impairments that might warrant specialized educational supports.

AB  - With educational expansion and rising standards, ever more students are being transferred into special education. These programs serve children and youth with ‘special educational needs’ (SEN), a heterogeneous group with social, ethnic, linguistic, physical, and intellectual disadvantages. An increasing proportion of students at risk of leaving secondary school without qualifications participate in special education. While most European countries aim to replace segregated schools and separate classes with school integration and inclusive education, cross-national comparisons of special education's diverse student bodies show considerable disparities in rates of SEN classification, provided learning opportunities, and educational attainments. Analyses of European special education demographics and organizations emphasize institutional instead of individual explanations. Findings from Germany and the United States further demonstrate that which students bear the greatest risk of becoming less educated depends principally on the institutionalization of special education systems and on definitions of ‘special educational needs’.

AB  - Black students, in general, are underserved academically (Darling-Hammond, 2000; Townsend, 2002) and overrepresented in special education (Donovan & Cross, 2002). Black students with disabilities are further overrepresented in more restrictive educational environments (Skiba, Poloni-Staudinger, Gallini, Simmons & Feggins-Azziz, 2006). Although the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2) revealed that the academic performance of students with learning disabilities is positively related to the percentage of courses taken in the general education setting (Newman, 2006), the research specifically on placement of Black students with disabilities, particularly at the secondary level, as it relates to academic achievement is lacking. While previous studies have sought to determine which placement is better for students with disabilities, no study was found that specifically examined the impact of placement specific to Black students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) in urban settings (Fore, III, Hagan-Burke, Burke, Boon & Smith, 2008; Rea, McLaughlin & Walther-Thomas, 2002). This study examined educational placement, instructional best practices, and achievement gains of Black students with SLD in urban secondary settings using an ex post facto research design. Achievement, placement, and demographic data were collected and analyzed on approximately 314 Black eighth grade students with SLD. The Teacher Instructional Practices Survey was developed and used to collect and analyze data from the teachers of 78 of these students as it relates to instructional best practices. Results indicate no significant difference in reading but a significant difference in math gains of students served in inclusive settings as compared to resource settings with a small effect size. Also, no significant relationship was found between achievement gains and the reported use of instructional best practices. However, there was a relationship between educational placement and the use of instructional best practices. The results implied that there is a need for training with both general and special education teachers on instructional best practices for SWD and that there should be certain IEP team considerations when making placement decisions for this population of students with disabilities. It is recommended that future research in this area include classroom observations and factors other than test scores to measure growth in achievement.

AB  - The aims of the study presented in this paper were twofold: to analyse if and how pupils who received some kind of special education differed from students who received no such support with respect to different self-concept and ability factors; and to investigate substantive consequences of different theoretical bases for statistical modelling. The information comprised school administrative data, ability test scores, student questionnaire and mathematics test scores. Such data are well suited for analyses where statistical models are being developed and tested. The statistical method principally used in this study is structural equation modelling (SEM). One reason for this methodological strategy was to get hold of latent variables (factors) which might explain differences between various groups of students. Five latent variables were found and generally special needs students proved to have lower values in most factors. However, within an aesthetical dimension these students had the highest values. This in turn may be due an emphasis upon 'academic' subject content such as Swedish and mathematics in special education. Students who have been subjected to special education of some kind show remarkably low means within a language factor. This is an indication of the strong focus upon reading and writing difficulties among students belonging to these groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Adolescent period is a very turbulent period in life of each individual, particularly in lives of those with developmental disabilities. One should make a descision weather to become employed and start independent living, or to continue education. In each case adolescents with developmental disabilities have limited or no choice. In the Republic of Croatia the majority of adolescents with developmental disabilities after finishing secondary school have no possibillity for further education and has to get employed. There are numerous problems in becomming employed, one of the most important are pro fessions which aren't recognized at the labour market. This investigation is carried out on the sample of 112 secondary school students of both sexes from the town of Varazdin. 56 students had no developmental disabilities and were attending the regular educational program. 56 were students with developmented disabilities who were included either in the regular, or in the special educational program. Students were educated for further professions: helping baker (9). baker (34), carpenter (17), tailor (17), galanterist (8). butcher (1). hairdresser (2), painter (5), car-body mechanic, helping carpenter (12), helping tailor (3). General questionaire (Osmancevic Katkic, L. Fulgosi Masnjak, R.. 2010.) was used for collecting data about participants, while their expectations from future were investigated with Questionaire - Expectations from future (Ajdukovic, M.. Kulenovic, A., 1992.) and Questionaire- My expectations from future (Urbane. K., 1999.). Collected data were analyzed through descriprive statistical techniques, differences between groups of participants were tested with Chi-square test.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to examine differences in social anxiety between learning disabled (LD) and non-learning disabled (non-LD) students, taking into account educational placement. The present research is the first to consider the above relations among Christian Arab adolescents living in Israel as an Eastern collectivist minority. On the whole, students with LD (learning disabilities) reported higher levels of social anxiety than their non-LD peers. Moreover, adolescents with LD studying in a special education classroom reported higher levels of social anxiety than adolescents with LD in a partially inclusive classroom. An interesting and unexpected result was the higher levels of generalised social anxiety (SAD-G) reported by male adolescents in comparison to female adolescents. These results provide evidence that students with LD, especially those attending special education classes, suffer from high levels of social anxiety. This means that they experience intense distress, which can be expected to impair their social and academic performance. According to the present research, there is a slight advantage to partially inclusive classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Large-scale longitudinal data on differences in pupils' cognitive and psychosocial development in various types of special and mainstream schools are reported in this article. The study focuses on comparing the development of matched pairs of primary-aged pupils in mainstream and special education over periods of 2 and 4 yrs. After 2 yrs, pupils made more progress in mathematics in mainstream education than in schools for children with learning and behavioural difficulties [LBD] and school motivation developed more favourably in schools for pupils with mild mental retardation [MMR]. After 4 yrs, pupils in regular education had made more progress in academic performance than their matched pairs in special education. Development is analysed with respect to the use of internal differentiation in the classroom and special provision for pupils with LBD/MMR. The hypothesis that the degree of specialist care being offered helps these pupils could not be confirmed. In the qualitative part of the research, processes at the level of the pupil, the school and the family are studied in order to look for explanations for divergent developments in academic performance and psychosocial functioning.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to employ value-added methodology to determine which placement setting offered the ninth grade 2009 special education high school cohort the most academic growth as measured on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS). This particular cohort was selected because it was the most recent cohort for which 3 years of TAKS testing data were available. For this study, placement setting was operationalized as the percentage of time students with disabilities spend in the general education classroom. Data were obtained from two databases through the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The Academic Excellence Indicator System (AEIS) database contains student achievement data as well as dropout, completion rates and other required data on every public school, district, or region in the state of Texas, and the Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS) stores information such as a student's instructional setting code, which is a code that denotes the percentage of time a student with disabilities spends in general education classes. To be included in the study, students' data had the following parameters applied: (a) same instructional arrangement code (IAC) for 3 years; (b) had 3 years of TAKS data; (c) qualified for special education services all 3 years; and (d) advanced to the next grade with their cohort group each of the 3 years. Research questions were answered by using multiple regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) calculations. Multiple regression was used to obtain an estimated performance score (EPS) on the TAKS reading and math tests using the first 2 (out of 3) years of student test scores. The EPS was compared to the actual third year TAKS score. The differences between the actual TAKS scores mean and the EPS mean indicated that students in less restrictive environments did not grow academically as expected in reading/language arts and math from 2008-2009 to 2010-2011. Conversely, the differences between the actual TAKS scores mean and the EPS mean indicated that the resource student group grew academically more than expected in both reading/language arts and math from 2008-2009 to 2010-2011. The results added to the knowledge base regarding inclusion given the scarcity of longitudinal studies directly linking special education students' access to the general education curriculum and improved student achievement (Hardman & Dawson, 2008).

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the differences in social functioning (status in peer group, child’s satisfaction with peer relations), as well as in educational functioning (teachers’ difficulties, child’s satisfaction with academic performance) of students with visual impairment and their teachers in three types of school setting: special, integrated and inclusive. The sample consisted of primary school students with visual impairment (n = 90) and their teachers (n = 59). The measurement instruments used were the Polish adaptation (Szumski, 2010) of the FDI questionnaire (Haeberlin, Blees, Moster and Klaghofer, 1989), with 45 self-report questions, a classic sociometric assessment technique, as well as a questionnaire with open-ended questions about the difficulties in teaching faced by the teachers. The data were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA. The results showed no significant differences among the three groups of children regarding their subjective opinions of school satisfaction. However, the sociometric status of visually impaired children in integrated and inclusive classrooms implies a small number of popular positions. Teachers reported difficulties in teaching children with visual impairments; these difficulties were categorised into two groups: those caused by the disability and those caused by inappropriate school functioning. Determination and comparison of the school situations of students with visual impairment seems to be particularly important in the current state of fundamental transformations of the educational system. These results may contribute to the creation and improvement of programs for inclusion of visually impaired children into regular schools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Visual impairment as an umbrella term includes all levels of vision loss. Researches in the field of visual disability are far from satisfactory in India. Some attempts have been made to study different aspects of the lives of visually disabled children. Such attempts help, revealing the facts of their life, characteristics, activities, performances, abilities and disabilities etc. The present investigation purports to find out the efficacy of emotional stability of visually disabled students studying in special schools and inclusive setup. The objective of the study is to compare the emotional stability of visual impaired students at secondary level of inclusive setup and special schools. Descriptive survey method has been adopted for the study. Population of the study consisted visually impaired children studying in special schools and inclusive setup. A sample of 100 students was drawn from various schools, through stratified random sampling technique. Emotional Maturity Scale developed by Singh, Y. and Bhargava, M. was used to collect information about students studying in inclusive setup and special schools. Mean, Standard Deviation and t-Scores were used for data analysis. Results reveal that though there was a significant difference in the emotional stability of children studying in inclusive setup and special schools, however, girls studying in different setups of school did not differ significantly in their emotional stability. The study throws light on the fact that children with visual impairment studying in inclusive setup are more emotionally stable than the children with visual impairment studying in special schools.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the social skills of five groups of children: children with visual impairments attending inclusive education schools, children with visual impairments attending schools for the blind, children with intellectual impairments attending inclusive education schools, children with intellectual impairments attending segregated special education schools, and typically developing children. A hundred and sixty-nine children aged from 7 to 12 participated in the study. The children's social skills were rated by their teachers on the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS)-Turkish Form. The results suggested significant group differences between children attending inclusive education schools and children attending special education schools. Analysis of the findings indicated that children with visual impairments and children with intellectual impairments had poorer social skills than typically developing children; however children with visual impairments and children with intellectual impairments attending inclusive education schools had higher social skills than children attending segregated special education schools. The findings of the study were discussed and suggestions for future research were provided.

AB  - This study reports on an investigation of the differences in results between students with special educational needs assigned to special classes or regular classes in lower secondary education. Cognitive competencies were measured using curricular Finnish and mathematics tasks, school achievement using grade point average (GPA), and learning motivation by using self-reported goal-orientation scales. Propensity score matching was utilized to match the students according to their propensity to be placed in special classes, and 134 pairs were produced out of 860 available students with SEN from which 477 were assigned to special classes. Results of students assigned to special classes did not differ in curricular Finnish and mathematics in ninth grade when compared to their closely-matched peers in regular classes. However, students in special classes had higher GPAs and a higher performance-approach orientation and mastery-extrinsic orientation than students assigned to regular classes.

AB  - This research examined the factors promoting inclusion of young people with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) in mainstream secondary schools, and noted high levels of behavioral difficulties in these pupils. The size of the secondary school, and the class size, impacted positively on the pupils with Autism, and the number of other pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN) statements and the number of support staff per pupil were both positive factors in school progress for children with Autism, but not Asperger's Syndrome. Support teachers and assistants helped to reduce emotional and behavioral difficulties, but also reduced improvements in pro-social behavior. Good staff-training promoted the pupils' social behaviors and their sense of school belonging. In summary, social-emotional behaviors are better facilitated in mainstream secondary schools with larger numbers of other children with SEN statements, individual support, which helps emotional and behavioral difficulties, but does not facilitate social behaviors, good teacher-training, which facilitates social behaviors, and a sense of school belonging.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate if the type of class setting is related to the utilisation of disability-related services and child welfare services outside school over time among children with mild intellectual disability (ID). A quantitative study with a longitudinal and comparative design was carried out including data from archival records concerning service utilisation among 405 children. Children in special classes were more likely than children integrated into regular classes to utilise disability-related services. Integrated children who changed school setting from regular classes to special classes were more likely to begin to utilise such services and to increase the number of services utilised, compared to children who remained integrated. Professionals in social services and schools may need to improve their collaboration around families of children with mild ID when assessing needs and providing services. Special attention may need to be devoted to children integrated into regular classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the question of which school environment--special or mainstream school--is more favourable for deaf and hard-of-hearing students in Sweden, when it comes to their well-being, and their social and academic inclusion. The aim is threefold: first to compare the well-being of adolescents who are deaf or hard-of-hearing, who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and have additional disabilities, and who have no disabilities; second to compare the adolescents from the two deaf and hard-of-hearing groups and their experiences of inclusion and exclusion in school; and third to ascertain if any gender differences exist between the two groups of deaf and hard-of-hearing students concerning their experiences of inclusion and exclusion. A total of 7865 adolescents (13-18 years of age) answered a total survey about the life and health of young people in a county in Sweden. The results show that both boys and girls in the hard-of-hearing groups rated their well-being lower and were less satisfied with their lives than pupils without disabilities. They also show that the hard-of-hearing boys and girls attending special school were more satisfied with their lives and to a greater extent felt included both socially and academically than students in mainstream school.

AB  - Background: There is a need for more knowledge about the utilization of habilitation services outside school among children with mild intellectual disability (ID). Specific aims. The aim of this study was to describe the patterns of habilitation service utilization among children with mild ID living in Sweden. Method: A quantitative cross-sectional total population study was performed using data from service providers’ existing records. Findings: The most common types of services utilized were those by physicians, counselors, and psychologists. Compared with children with mild ID who were in special classes, children with mild ID who were integrated into mainstream classes utilized significantly fewer types of services. Increasing age of the child was associated with a lower number of service types utilized. Children integrated into mainstream classes were significantly less likely to utilize habilitation services than children attending special classes. The likelihood of utilizing habilitation services decreased with age. Approximately two-thirds of the children utilized habilitation services. Discussion: It is urgent that integration/inclusion in one organizational system, that is, school, does not result in exclusion in another system, such as pediatric habilitation services, which also aim to promote active participation in society. Pediatric habilitation professionals, teachers, and health units at schools need to interact in a manner so that children with mild ID, independent of type of school setting, have access to disability-related services outside school.

AB  - Since leaders of a Central New York school implemented integrated cotaught (ICT) classrooms, no local investigation of ICT has taken place, leaving district administrators without empirical evidence of the value and effectiveness of the ICT services. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between ICT services and student academic achievement in English language arts (ELA) and mathematics, as measured by the New York State ELA and mathematics assessments for 4th and 5th graders. Vygotsky's paradigm of cognitive development, which states that learners acquire knowledge through collaborative interactions with other students, guided this study because ICT classrooms emphasize social learning for students of all abilities. Research questions were used to determine the differences in ELA and mathematics performance between students with disabilities (SWD) in ICT and non-ICT classroom settings. An analysis of covariance compared math and ELA achievement of 4th and 5th grade classes from the 2008-2009 academic year (AY), 1 year prior to ICT implementation, to 4th and 5th grade classes from the 2009-2010 AY, 1 year after ICT implementation. With a census sample of 103 students, both 4th and 5th grade ICT classes scored significantly higher on the ELA than the non-ICT classes, p = .011 and p = .001, respectively. Also, both 4th and 5th grade ICT classes outperformed their non-ICT counterparts significantly in mathematics, p < .001 and p < .001, respectively. This study contributes to social change by informing administrators, teachers, and the educational community that the provision of special education services (ICT) in general education classrooms is associated with increased academic achievement for SWD.

AB  - This research replicates an earlier study and extends it by shifting instructional responsibility from researchers to special education teachers, who implemented reading instruction that included multisyllabic word decoding, academic vocabulary, and three comprehension strategies (generating main ideas, comparing and contrasting people and events, and identifying cause and effect relations) with their intact eighth grade history classes, using history text as the "reading" material. Participants included 73 eighth grade students with disabilities (77 percent with learning disabilities, 72 percent males, and 45 percent English language learners) and four teachers. Compared to students with disabilities in typical special education history classes, students in the treatment outperformed controls on researcher-developed measures of word- and text-level reading comprehension, as well as in the history content that students in both conditions studied. Across reading strategies, implementation of "nearly all lesson components" ranged from 72 percent to 83 percent.

AB  - This study evaluates and compares special educational services for children with dyslexia in three different Irish educational settings: special schools, reading units and mainstream resource provision. The emphasis is on the child's experience of special education. Participants were dyslexic children aged 8-13 who had been accessing special educational services for two academic years. Data collection involved individual interviews with each of the 100 children. Further data about the child's experience were collected by parental questionnaire. Results suggested that while children overall were happy and evaluated special educational services positively across all three settings, children in special schools and reading units seemed to be happier and to have more positive experiences than children attending mainstream resource provision. The discussion considers the implications of these findings in the context of the inclusion debate in special education. It also considers the limitations of this small-scale study and the need for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of this study was to better understand the gaps between policy and practice in inclusive education for the Republic of Serbia. The study compared the academic achievement in Mathematics of comparable students with mild intellectual disabilities (MID) in the fifth and sixth grade who attend typical elementary schools and special schools. A total of 249 students participated in the study. All students were either 11 or 12 years old at the time of the study and were matched by ability, based on local educational and psychological assessments. Results indicated that students with mild intellectual disabilities who attend special schools scored significantly higher on mathematics achievements in comparison to their peers with similar disabilities in regular schools. Although the aim of the Republic of Serbia's new education policy focuses on inclusion, preliminary research indicates that students may be integrated (not included) and that regular classroom practice may not be supporting students with disabilities. A closer look at strategies that appear successful in special schools (such as adapted teaching strategies, work in small groups of students, and continuous individualised support of teachers) may provide instructional insights for newly included students in Serbia.

AB  - This study examined the views of 101 boys and girls aged 10-11 and 13-14 with statements of special educational needs for moderate learning difficulties. Questions centred on their experiences of school, teaching and learning in mainstream and special schools. The study is set in the context of the international move towards more inclusion of children with disabilities into mainstream schools and the greater importance attached to the child's voice in decision-making in education. Most children expressed positive evaluations of their schools and the teaching they received, while a significant minority expressed mixed views. A significant proportion in the mainstream preferred learning support in withdrawal settings. While the majority in both settings preferred their current school, a significant minority in special school preferred to be in a mainstream setting. A notable emergent theme from the study was the high incidence of 'bullying' that was experienced. Though experienced in both settings, those in special schools experienced far more 'bullying' by children from other mainstream schools and from peers and outsiders in their neighbourhood. These findings are discussed in terms of the tensions or dilemmas about difference that were experienced and their implications for the move towards greater inclusion.

AB  - Cultural, educational, and legal changes have significantly altered the mix of students in regular education classrooms. A typical classroom today might include students who are not reading on grade level; students whose first language is not English; students with behavioral, motivational, and attentional problems; students from varied cultural backgrounds; students classified as gifted; and students with learning disabilities, emotional disabilities, speech and language disabilities, and mild mental disabilities. Students with emotional, learning, and mild cognitive disabilities often experience decreased academic and social outcomes when compared to peers without disabilities. Understanding students with various disabilities, how they think, and what motivates them can help teachers reach these students. With a better understanding of these factors, teachers can improve the effectiveness of their teaching styles, thus improving the outcomes for these students in the classroom as well as on standardized tests and on graduation rates. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the graduation success rate of students with a disability based on the various special education teaching models used, including students taught in a co-taught setting, mainstreamed classrooms, and tiered classrooms. The primary research question that motivated this study was, 'Is there a difference in graduation rates among students with a disability based on the special education model in which the student received instruction?'.

AB  - Recent legislation in education mandates that students with disabilities be given access to the general education curriculum in order to reach higher academic standards. To meet these requirements, co-teaching has become a popular service delivery model for instruction of students with disabilities within the general education setting. The purpose of this causal-comparative study was to compare math achievement of secondary students with disabilities in general education co-taught math classes to students with disabilities in special education resource math classes. Participants included 145 high school students with disabilities from four large suburban schools in Northeast Georgia. Learning outcomes were measured by scores on the Georgia Math II End of Course Test. Math I End of Course Test scores from the previous school year were used as a covariate to control for differences in math ability between the groups. Data were analyzed for statistical significance using an ANCOVA. Results indicated that students instructed in co-taught math classes had higher mean scores on end of course tests than students instructed in resource math classes. The findings suggest that co-teaching had a small effect in influencing outcomes in math. Implications for practice indicate that the design of effective teaching practices and instruction are necessary for the attainment of math skills. Future research would help identify important instructional components, teacher experience and training, as well as provide broader generalization of results.

Implications for practice indicate that the design of effective teaching practices and instruction are necessary for the attainment of math skills. Future research would help identify important instructional components, teacher experience and training, as well as provide broader generalization of results.

AB  - Since the inception of ESEA of 1965 student achievement has been one focus on public education. Fast-forward to NCLB of 2001, a reenactment of the ESEA of 1965; school leaders have been pushed to demonstrate student achievement to all learners. With increased demands to close the achievement gap and track struggling learners co-teaching models have become increasingly popular in public schools. This study took place in a public high school located in the Southwest region of the United States. The study consisted of mix-methods using both quantitative and qualitative measurements. The study examined student achievement among general education and special education students who participated in co-teaching model core classes. Academic achievement using quarter one and quarter two benchmark assessment findings were compared between general education and special education students. The ATTMS survey was administered to both general education and special education teachers who work in co-teaching model classes in English, mathematics, science, and social studies in the study school. The survey was distributed to 23 teachers at FKHS and secure software was used to ensure the survey respondents remained anonymous. The survey consisted of nine Likert-scaled questions to measure teacher attitudes toward teaching all students. After the survey was administered, five general education and five special education teachers volunteered for a one-hour focus group interview. The interview was transcribed and common response sub-items were discovered. The quantitative results did not show a significant difference between academic achievement among general education and special education students enrolled in co-teaching model classes in each of the core content areas. The focus group interview portion of the study revealed several response sub-items from general education and special education teachers who participate in co-teaching model classes. Teachers did not provide negative feedback during the focus group, rather they provided positive input regarding the need for more support to ensure all students are successful. The survey question teachers responded to were not necessarily supported by the focus group discussion. Interestingly the focus group discussed the interpretations of the survey questions and most of the survey questions were not fully supported by the focus group discussion. The response sub-items provided more insight as to why respondents selected positive, negative, and neutral choices. Overall teachers had a vested interest in all of the students they serve including students with mild to moderate disabilities.

AB  - The inclusion of students with disabilities in higher education helps people with disabilities and also to the entire university community. This paper analyzes the intent of supporting the inclusion of students with disabilities at university classroom, in the framework of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), towards an empirical study conducted among 629 students of the Faculty of Education at the University of A Coruña (Spain). Results indicate that all attitudes, social norms and perceived control are statistically significant variables in explaining the intention of supporting people with disabilities.

AB  - This study compared 4 groups of students (aged 11-20 yrs) with a physical disability who differed in their level of school integration: (1) 53 US integrated students, (2) 14 Czech integrated students, (3) 51 Czech students educated at special schools on a daily basis, and (4) 66 Czech students attending special schools on a residential basis. In addition, these young people with a disability were compared to a normative sample of Czech students without a disability. The comparisons were made on self-reported self-perceptions, aggression/emotional instability, view of the world, and dependency using the Personality Assessment Questionnaire (R. P. Rohner, 1991). Significant between group differences favouring integration were found. More integrated students reported lower levels of aggression, more positive views of themselves, and more positive views of the world. Discussion addressed implications for educational policies for children with special needs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This thesis on curriculum development within inclusive learning environments for pupils identified with specific learning difficulties details the development of the concept of inclusion worldwide and its implementation in England. The research study documents inclusive and pedagogical practices within mainstream education, involving the relevant theories that underpin them, which influence considerably the learning processes of pupils who have been diagnosed either officially or by their teachers with specific learning difficulties, and especially with dyslexia at Key Stage 2 for literacy and reading. The principal focus of this study is the above pupils’ learning experiences as they were shaped by their school curricula, inclusive measures and learning arrangements. This study is further informed by moderate social constructivism and it incorporates grounded theory within three case studies. Ten pupils aged 9-10 identified with specific learning difficulties, and especially with dyslexia, their parents and staff members from three mainstream primary schools in London participated in the research. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, naturalistic classroom observations and document analysis and they were thematically analysed. A number of the schools’ learning and inclusive practices, namely seating arrangements and special provision, was found to influence significantly the learning processes of the children who participated in the research and eventually their self-image as learners. Individual teacher perspectives and practices tended to be in tension with the above pupils’ learning needs having crucial effects on their self-awareness, motivation, self-confidence and learning progress. The thesis recommends reconsideration of inclusive approaches, comprising pupils’ labelling, diagnostic assessment, pedagogical and assessment methods applied within literacy and reading classrooms. It also supports the acknowledgement of learners’ individuality in learning process through the reconstruction of learning environments. An alternative curriculum based on learning and curriculum theories as well as on those respondents’ perspectives and experiences is suggested focusing on their equality in learning opportunities and on their well-being.

AB  - This study examined the sense of coherence and loneliness of 19 children aged 12-14 years with severe to profound hearing loss. These feelings and their interrelations with speech intelligibility (SI) were examined in 2 settings: in special classes within regular schools (group inclusion) or individuals integrated into regular classes (individual inclusion). Two self-report measures (Loneliness Questionnaire and Sense of Coherence Scale) and one SI measure were utilized. Results indicated no significant differences between sense of coherence and loneliness scores of children in the 2 settings. Children in group inclusion received a significantly lower average SI score than did children who were in individual inclusion. Examination of the relations between SI and loneliness and coherence in each educational setting revealed no significant relations among these measures for the children in the group inclusion, whereas significant correlations did emerge for the children who were in individual inclusion. The study emphasized the importance of good SI not only for basic communication but also as a factor that affects the child's social and emotional feelings. In selecting a school setting, it is important to look beyond academic factors and not to ignore the significant effect of SI on the child's well being in school.

AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing public concern regarding the poor reading achievement of many students nationwide (National Reading Panel, 2000). Of particular concern is the reading performance of students with disabilities, who make up a significant proportion of students with reading problems. According to the 29th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (2007), nearly 15% of school-aged children received special education services in the 2006-2007 academic year. The current study investigated the reading achievement across time of students receiving special education services who struggle with reading. The impact of instructional group size (individual, small group), teacher qualifications (experience, education, professional development) and child-instruction interaction (i.e., degree to which instruction is differentiated to address student skills) on reading achievement was examined using latent growth modeling. Teacher qualifications (experience, education, and professional development) did not predict reading growth. Frequency of small group instruction impacted reading comprehension but not fluency, whereas, frequency of individual instruction did not appear to impact either reading outcome. Results provided evidence that supports a positive association between degree to which instruction is aligned with student reading skill and reading growth. Thus, this study extends results from general education regarding the relationship between child-instruction interaction and reading growth (e.g., Connor, Jakobsons, Crowe, & Meadows, 2009) to a large sample of upper elementary students in special education.

AB  - Students with Emotional Disabilities (ED) graduate from high school at rates far below their peers. The completed study utilized archival data from former students' special education folders and from a nondisabled comparison group to examine variables that had previously been studied in relation to graduation (e.g., repeating ninth grade, extracurricular participation) along with variables identified from the folders of the former students. The descriptive quantitative study identified variables that predicted graduation for individuals with ED and the differences between the variables for individuals with ED and the nondisabled group. The results indicated that GPA and extracurricular participation positively predicted graduation while the number of years spent in 9th grade negatively predicts graduation for both groups. Specifically for students with ED, student attendance at special education meetings was statistically significant for predicting graduation.

AB  - In the present study, systematic comparisons between Swiss children attending regular first grade classes and those enrolled in classes for children with special needs (so-called 'Einführungsklassen', in which the first grade curriculum is spread over two years) are reported. Different aspects of executive skills in the domain of short-term memory, attention, motor coordination, and achievement motivation are addressed. For most cognitive measures, children in special needs classes perform more poorly than children in regular classes. Deficits appeared to be pronounced in tasks of high complexity and with multiple demands, but there were no differences with respect to self-concept and school motivation. Follow-up analyses indicate that improvement in most of the tasks was minimal and that children in special needs classes do not catch up to their age-mates. The findings are discussed in terms of adequate placement of these children and the need for early and efficient prevention/intervention programs.

AB  - Abstract: This study explored the adaptive behavior of primary school students with visual impairments, as well as the impact of educational setting on their adaptive behavior. Instrumentation included an informal questionnaire and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales. Participants were 36 primary school students with visual impairments. The educational setting had an effect on Daily Living Skills and Socialization. Students with visual impairments visiting special schools present worse adaptive behavior (higher developmental delay) compared to students visiting mainstream schools. Moreover, the educational level of parents influences the developmental delay on the Communication and Socialization. The higher the educational level of parents the lower the developmental delay.

AB  - This study compares the socio-emotional problems experienced by deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students with those of hearing students in Ethiopia. The research involved a sample of 103 grade 4 students attending a special school for the deaf, a special class for the deaf and a regular school. Socio-emotional problems were measured using Goodman’s self-report measure, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for children and adolescents. Participants were selected from seven towns in Ethiopia. The results show that, compared to the hearing sample, the DHH students experienced more severe socio-emotional problems across all dimensions, regardless of whether they were in special classes or special schools. The DHH children reported that socio-emotional difficulties interfered with their home lives, friendships, classroom learning, and ability to get along with the people around them. The DHH students scored higher in the externalising behavioural domains than did the hearing students. There was no statistically significant difference between the DHH students in the special school and special class settings. The results show that DHH children expressed great concern about their socio-emotional difficulties. Teachers and other professionals need to raise their awareness about DHH issues in order to help these children overcome their challenges. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines and evaluates special provision for pupils with dyslexia in three different settings: reading schools, reading units and mainstream support. The research focused on the teaching and learning context for pupils with dyslexia, the support teacher, the mainstream teacher and the experience of the student. The main participants were teachers and tutors supporting pupils with dyslexia, and the parents of these children. Survey methods included questionnaires, focus group discussions, interviews and quantitative data on pupils' reading attainment. In addition, a total of six schools, two representing each model of support, were selected as case studies. This article reports part of a larger survey, which evaluated the effectiveness of three models of special provision for children with dyslexia in primary school. The study shows that there are academic and social benefits for the child with dyslexia who is enrolled in a special setting. However, placement in a reading school or reading unit per se does not guarantee that a child will 'catch up' with his or her peers. The findings reported a similarity in the methods and practices teachers use in both mainstream and special settings. The discussion suggests that if teachers are to 'catch them before they fall' there are serious questions that must be asked about how we are teaching basic literacy skills. The findings suggest an urgent need for a more balanced approach to teaching reading and writing. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Recent initiatives in Ireland have begun to develop services for pupils who experience learning difficulties. Extra support may take place in the child's mainstream school from the learning support or resource teacher or in a special setting such as enrolment in a reading unit or in a reading school. This study sets out to examine and evaluate special provision for pupils with dyslexia in three settings. The study asks how effective is the special education support to the student with difficulties arising from dyslexia. The main participants were teachers and tutors supporting pupils with dyslexia, and the parents of these children. Survey methods included questionnaires, focus group discussions, interviews and quantitative data on pupils' reading attainment. Six case-study schools were also examined. A distinctly medical-categorical model of disability is evident among the participants in this study. Support for the dyslexic learner continues to be provided in a separate and parallel system of special support. The present identification and assessment process relies on an exclusionary and discrepancy-based diagnosis of dyslexia. The concept of a 'discrepancy' between intelligence and reading attainment in identifying dyslexia is found to be a barrier in developing the competence of teachers in identifying dyslexia. Throughout the study the central issue of literacy teaching and reading instruction is examined in each of the teaching settings. The main methods employed focus on reading accuracy and fluency. All of the teachers supporting the child with dyslexia have a dominant emphasis on teaching phonic skills. The skills of word knowledge, fluency, comprehension and writing do not receive equal balance. The study shows that there are positive factors associated with placement in a special setting and evidence that these factors are also associated with progress in reading. The views of both the parents and the pupils are clearly in favour of the special placement. There is evidence that academic and social benefits of the special setting persist into the second level. Inadequate links between special and mainstream schools are frequently identified. The point of transition between special and mainstream creates particular difficulty for pupils and parents.

AB  - For many lower ability children, inclusion in the mainstream setting does not guarantee that that their individual needs will be met. With increased numbers of children with well-below average ability being placed in mainstream schools, it is imperative that teachers understand factors which impact on learning for this group of children. Current trends in the teaching of reading may present barriers to learning for children who have moderate learning difficulties and severe literacy difficulties.

AB  - Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) has been mandated by the United States Congress since 1975. Many different initiatives, such as mainstreaming and integration, have unsuccessfully attempted to meet the intent of this mandate. There are many reasons for these failures, including the attempt to provide special education services in isolation of a systemic change within the schools and a lack of effective teaching strategies. Different delivery models for instruction of special education students have been explored in an attempt to meet the needs of learning disabled students. The purpose of this research is to examine the three different delivery models used to provide intervention to special education students. The study will specifically focus on a co-teaching model, an itinerant support model, and a resource room model. The research will explore the systemic changes that need to take place within the school as well as the individual skills the regular and special education teachers need to utilize to make inclusion effective. The research will examine fifteen students in three different delivery models. The study will employ a single subject design method using an A-B-A design. The students will be assessed using a Key Math Revised and a Math Inventory focusing on computation as a pretest. The students, teachers, and the parents will be assessed using The Instructional Environment System II (TIES II) to assess the complete learning environment. The students will be assessed again after five months of treatment to evaluate if any gains have been made in the area of math. The assessment will consist of another form of the Key Math Revised and a different form of the Math Inventory. The data from the two assessments will be analyzed using single subject design methodology, including graphing and a T-test. The information gained from the TIES II in conjunction with the math data will be used to make recommendations regarding what strategies are most successful at raising math levels. It is the intent of the research, through the evaluation of the classroom environments, to uncover successful inclusionary practices for school-wide applications.

AB  - This comparison study was an examination of the academic achievement of speech language impaired special education students taught in a resource pull-out service delivery model, compared to those who received instruction in a resource inclusion service delivery model in high schools, in an urban South Carolina school district. The target population for this study included ninth grade speech-language impaired, special education students enrolled in high school, in an urban South Carolina school district. during the fall of 2018. The academic achievement of the target population was measured using English I and Algebra I End-of-Course (EOC) exam scores.The purpose of this study was to compare the academic achievement of ninth grade speech language impaired special education students receiving services in a resource pull-out delivery model versus a resource inclusion service delivery model. Available research exposed potential strengths and weaknesses with both types of placement options; however, there was limited research focused on whether speech language impaired special education students experience greater growth academically in a resource pull-out model or a resource inclusion model. Due to the limited availability of prior research and inconsistent literary findings, this comparison sought to investigate which program accomplishes this goal most effectively, the pull-out model or the inclusion model?The comparison of the academic achievement of speech language impaired special education students receiving services in a resource pull-out delivery model versus a resource inclusion delivery model was explored using a comparative design. The methodology of this study examined Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and utilized statistical software that performed an analysis of descriptive statistics such as mean. median, and standard deviation of English I, and Algebra I End-of-Course examination scores. The sample population was compared based on achievement scores in English I (End-of-Course Exam) and Algebra I (End-of-Course Exam) to determine whether there was a significant difference between the academic achievement of speech language impaired special education students receiving services in a pull-out model compared to those receiving instruction in an inclusion model, in high schools, in an urban South Carolina school district. All data for the comparison was collected using Enrich access.The results of the study indicated that ninth grade speech language impaired special education students that received pull-out services performed similar on the English I End-of-Course exam compared to those students that received inclusion service. According to the results of the study, gender and racial ethnicity had no significant effect on the English I End-of-Course exam scores of ninth grade speech language impaired special education students receiving pull-out services versus those receiving inclusion services.The results of the study also revealed that ninth grade speech language impaired special education students that received pull-out services performed significantly lower on the Algebra I End-of-Course exam compared to those students that received inclusion service. According to the results of the study, gender and racial ethnicity had no significant effect on the Algebra I End-of-Course exam scores of ninth grade speech language impaired special education students receiving pull-out services versus those receiving inclusion services.The findings from the study could help school administrators, teachers, and speech pathologists, in urban School Carolina school districts understand how the pullout model and inclusion service delivery model should be implemented, and the positive/negative affects both models have on the academic achievement of speech language impaired special education students.

AB  - The enrollment of children with ASD in public school settings has escalated in conjunction with the increased incidence of the diagnosis (Yeargin-Allsopp et al., 2003). Characteristics associated with ASD can present unique challenges for both children and teachers in the classroom. According to many researchers, positive teacher attitudes are one of the most salient variables influencing successful inclusion of children with disabilities in regular classrooms (Bender, Vial & Scott, 1995; Buell, Hallam, Gamel-McCormick & Scheer, 1999; Chow & Winzer, 1992; Jamieson, 1984). There is less documentation of teachers’ attitudes toward inclusion when children with ASD are enrolled in general education classrooms as well as the extent to which children with autism progress in inclusive classrooms. The current research addresses contextual factors that may impact child progress in kindergarten and first grade classrooms. More specifically, the study examines placement or the amount of special education that children received, the functional skill acquisition of children with ASD, as well as associations among teacher attitudes and the quality of the inclusive classroom setting.

AB  - In the first article, the authors analyze institutional designs, resources devoted to education, public education values, disability policies, and student diversity. In the second article, the authors synthesize 15 years of research on two dominant accountability frameworks in U.S. education, standards-driven and market-driven, with the latter framework reflected particularly in charter schools. In the third article, the authors' findings from a process-focused external evaluation of the scale-up phase of a whole school improvement project, the Getting Results Network. In the fourth article, the authors examines the effects of 'inclusion'-educating students with disabilities in general education settings alongside non-disabled peers for some or all of the school day-on non-disabled students. In the fifth article, the authors describe a quasi-experimental study, in Israel, that investigated the impact of a school-based program that provided direct contact between students with and without disabilities. We appreciate the efforts of all authors who submitted manuscripts for this Special Issue. Their efforts are helping shed light on the inner workings of efforts designed to improve outcomes for all groups of students, many of whom-along with parents and advocates-have had to struggle to gain recognition and representation.

AB  - Educators and parents have long noticed that the youngest-in-class students seem to struggle academically and socially. The Relative Age Effect, or a student’s chronological age relative to peers in the same grade assignment, has become more widely and internationally of interest. Relative Age Effect, or RAE, has been linked to wide range of areas: sports, academic achievement, retention rate, special education services, gifted placement, Attention Deficit Disorder diagnoses, school attendance, bullying, self-esteem, suicide, and high school leadership tendencies (Verachtert, De Fraine, Onghena, & Ghesquière, 2010; Evans, Morrill, & Parente, 2010; Cobley, McKenna, Baker, & Wattie, 2009; Jansen, Veenstra, Ormel, Verhulst, & Reijneveld, 2011; Dhuey & Lipscomb, 2008). Recent studies even suggest that RAE persists into adulthood with an impact on higher educational attainment, CEO appointments, and income inequality (Du, Gao, & Levi, 2008; Kern & Friedman, 2009; Kawaguchi 2011; Du, Gao, & Levi, 2012). With equitability such a current flashpoint topic due to widening gaps between identified groups of students, developmentally equitable expectations should rest on firm pedagogy. The purpose of this non-experimental quantitative study, through ex post facto analysis of existing state-level testing data, was to determine if there was a Relative Age Effect regarding academic achievement in Language Arts (LA) across several sub-groups: race, gender, grade level, and Title I Schools compared to non-Title I Schools. The sample of 729 students was pulled from a large, diverse school district in Mississippi. Of the 729 students, 346 were male and 383 were female, 256 were African American, 419 were Caucasian, and 54 were of Other races. The Other category included American Indian, Pacific Islander, Asian, and Hispanic. The participants were divided into quarters of birth. This investigation was a partial replication of several studies found in states within the United States and internationally (Hensley, 2014 & Moussa, 2012). The results showed that when considering the independent variables of gender, race, and enrollment in either a Schoolwide Title I School or a Non-Schoolwide Title I School with Quarters of Birth, significance was found between First Quarter and Fourth Quarter Birthdates with regard to MCT 2 LA Scale Scores. It was found that Relative Age Effect does play a role in the academic achievement of 3rd grade students as measured by the Mississippi Curriculum Test 2 when considering gender, race, and enrollment in either a Schoolwide Title I School or a Non-Schoolwide Title I School. Suggestions for mitigating the potential hazards of RAE are discussed in Chapter 5.

AB  - How to effectively meet the academic needs of students who receive special education services is the prime focus of this educational position paper (EPP). No Child Left Behind (NCLB) has challenged schools to find ways to meet and exceed the standards for all students regardless of their category of disability or their academic program setting. This challenge prompted the research into the importance of the academic setting of special education students and its relationship to mathematics achievement. The focus of this EPP is on the academic setting of special education students and its relationship with student performance on the mathematics’ component of the Delaware Student Testing Program (DSTP). The study determined that there is indeed a correlation when reviewing the DSTP data of eighth grade students at Postlethwait Middle School (PMS) over a course of five years. This EPP examined the differences between two academic program settings, the resource setting and the inclusion setting, and their correlation with math achievement. This EPP further analyzed pre- and post-inclusion student achievement data at PMS to further determine if there was a correlation with academic achievement when inclusion was partially implemented. PMS yielded the most positive academic results, exceeding the state target when inclusion was first partially implemented in 2005. The data were collected over a five year period, 2003-2007. The data showed a relationship between the two program settings when comparing student growth based on scale scores, and when comparing pre- and post-inclusion implementation data. Recommendations to increase special education student achievement and future recommendations for further study are explored.

AB  - In Germany, adolescents with emotional and behavioural disturbances (EBD) are either schooled in special schools for students with EBD or in regular schools. The present study is the first to compare the perceived attainment of a broad range of developmental tasks of adolescents with and without EBD attending regular vs. special schools. While about 40% of German adolescents from schools for students with EBD did not fulfil the criteria of EBD according to the Youth Self-Report, almost 40% of the students from regular schools fulfilled these criteria. Using ordinal logistic regression analysis, main effects for school type and EBD status as well as interaction effects of school type and EBD status were observed. Adolescents attending special schools reported lower progress in the attainment of one out of 12 developmental tasks. Compared to students without EBD, students with EBD perceived lower attainment of seven developmental tasks, especially of those linked to taking responsibilities of adulthood. The results are discussed regarding how successful attainment of developmental tasks can be supported. Also, reasons for the large number of students without self-reported EBD attending a special school are considered.

AB  - The rejection of pupils with behaviour problems is a serious problem for inclusive education schools. Sometimes parents prefer special schools because they do not want their children to become outsiders in integration classes. Are they right? The study presented here surveys children with behaviour problems in integrated primary school classes and in special education schools. The main focus is the extent to which behaviour problems influence social relations within the classes. The findings indicate that German pupils with behaviour problems are not well liked. The comparison of special education classes and integrated primary school classes also shows, however, that this is not solely a feature of integrated classes. Pupils with behaviour problems are disliked in both systems, and to a comparable degree. This means that there may be some good arguments for special schools. But both systems--special schools and integrated school classes--have outsiders. Especially parents of pupils with learning difficulties and behaviour problems should know that there is no difference here between special education classes and integrative primary school classes.

AB  - Aim To describe the pattern of use of rehabilitation services in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy ( CP), and to identify factors associated with use. Methods In this study, parents of 91 school-age children and 167 adolescents with CP completed a questionnaire regarding educational and rehabilitation resources received within the last 6 months. Rehabilitation services included occupational therapy ( OT), physical therapy ( PT), speech language pathology ( SLP), psychology and special education. Demographic characteristics were documented and developmental and functional status was assessed. Relationships between service utilization and sociodemographic factors, functioning and school setting were determined. Results Over half of children (53.2%) and adolescents (57.5%) were in regular schools; however, 41% of these required special education resources. The remainder (42.5-46.8%) was in special schools. The majority of children (84.6%) were receiving at least one rehabilitation service although this decreased (68.1%) in adolescence. PT and OT were most common and services were provided predominantly in the school setting. Services were primarily weekly direct interventions at school age, with weekly interventions or consultations most common for adolescents. Younger age was associated with service receipt at school age only. Children with greater motor limitations, lower IQ and greater activity limitations were more likely to receive OT, PT, SLP or special education. Children in segregated schools were significantly more likely to receive rehabilitation services, when compared with children in regular schools. Conclusions The majority of children and youth received one or more services. Individuals with greater motor or cognitive challenges were more likely to receive a range of school-based services from rehabilitation specialists. When compared with children of school age, adolescents were less likely to receive services and when provided, services were more likely to be consultative. Services may need to be more optimally organized through childhood to enhance benefits to children with CP across activity limitation profiles.

AB  - This study examines the effect of placement in specialized establishments on adolescent males' and females' perceived competence following school failure. Perceived competence is measured by the Self-Perception Profile of Harter (1985) validated in French by Pierrehumbert, Plancherel and Jankech Caretta (1987). The sample is composed of 260 adolescents with mental retardation and 117 adolescents with conduct disorders placed in specialized establishments, 84 adolescents from ordinary school without delay and 42 with delay. Results show that adolescent females who had experienced school failure and were placed in specialized establishment had better scores in the ``scholastic{''} and ``athletic{''} competence domains than did their female counterparts who were placed in an ordinary class. This overestimation is merely defensive and the consequence of educational methods used in the medical/social sector. In our discussion, we propose-several causal suggestions to explain our findings.

The specific problem studied was the impact of the severity of disability on the effectiveness of the inclusion policy in relation to academic performance. The academic performances of learning disabled middle school students were compared while controlling for (a) classroom setting and (b) severity of learning disability. The study found that moderately learning-disabled middle school students performed better academically in inclusive classrooms where special education was provided as necessary than in either special education or full-inclusion classrooms. The study found that severely learning-disabled middle school students performed better academically in special education classrooms than in either inclusive with some special education classrooms or in full-inclusion classrooms. The findings are important in relation to social change involving the development of student-centered strategies within a framework of the concept of Free Appropriate Public Education.

AB  - Instructional placement of students with disabilities has always been at the forefront of the special education debate. Administrators and teachers, both general and special educators, have been faced with the challenges of diligently grouping students effectively, as classrooms have grown in size and cultural complexity. Academic achievement based on instructional placement is a significant topic within special education as current literature continues to recommend that further research is required in middle grades to determine which setting, inclusion or pull-out, provides the most instructional benefit for disabled students. However, researchers do not know if there is a statistically significant difference in the academic achievement of students with disabilities instructed in the resource setting and students with disabilities educated in the co-taught environment. This study was conducted utilizing a descriptive, comparative design with a quantitative method of data collection. A descriptive, comparative design is appropriate when researchers analyze, compare, and evaluate numerical data surrounding a hypothesis, and they identify existing concerns regarding insufficient data from previous studies and determine an accurate result. The targeted population for this study consisted of students diagnosed with a specific learning disability who received their academic instruction in either a resource or a co-taught environment. The researcher determined if there was a significant difference in student achievement on the state-mandated assessment program based on where the students received academic instruction. This study used a non-experimental design as existing data previously collected was used to compare but not manipulate results from the state-mandated assessment program. Through the use of pre-existing data, group statistics cannot be artificially created, thereby leading to greater validity of the study's conclusion and lessening the introduction of valid threats to the research and factors that are uncontrolled in the experiment. The results of this study determined that there was a significant difference in the academic achievement of students with a specific learning disability instructed in the resource setting and those with a specific learning disability educated in the co-taught environment. English-language arts scores were significantly higher for co-taught educated students than for resource taught students in both the spring 2015 and spring 2016 administration of the assessment.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine parent and early intervention professional perceptions and experiences of the legislative requirement of the parent participation and education component of Early Childhood Special Education. The study focuses on examination of reports of parent and early intervention professional experiences and analysis of child outcome data of children receiving intervention among three different service delivery models of Early Childhood Special Education. Data are collected from 24 parent and early intervention professionals, each experiencing one of three service delivery models, and record review of developmental outcomes for language, social, and motor skills for 120 children enrolled in early childhood special education programs and services. The study uses a mixed methods approach, whereby qualitative methods are used to examine perceptions and identification of components of parent participation and education for special education preschoolers. Quantitative measures are used to determine which service delivery model(s) are predictive of positive child and family outcomes. Findings reveal that five common themes emerge from participant reported experiences that are ascribed to positive family and child outcomes: parent-teacher relationships, home visits, parent to parent support, parent training, and inclusion of family members in the intervention plan. Examination of the impact of service delivery model on child outcomes using ANOVAs and post hoc comparisons reveals statistically significant positive social skill outcomes for children receiving services or service combined with programs. Implications for informing practice within Early Childhood Special Education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Little is known of the relationship between the least restrictive environment (LRE) provision of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and postsecondary participation for secondary students with disabilities despite the current policy emphasis on college and career readiness for all students. In this study, we examined the instructional setting in English/language arts and mathematics among secondary students with disabilities using data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2. Logistic regression analyses revealed that students with disabilities were 2 times more likely to participate in 2- and 4-year programs if they received general education instruction in math. Follow-up moderator analyses showed the likelihood of 4-year postsecondary participation among students with hearing, speech, visual, orthopedic, and other health impairments was significantly amplified if they received language arts instruction in general education classrooms. These findings serve as useful baseline data to compare with student outcomes during and after the No Child Left Behind Act and will ultimately inform transition planning for secondary students with disabilities.

AB  - The field of special education has been challenged by the quandary over which educational environment provides the best academic opportunities for students with learning disabilities: self-contained versus inclusive. Proponents of self-contained classroom placement have insisted students with learning disabilities placed in self-contained classrooms receive better instruction due to the reduced class sizes and the efficient delivery of special education services. Proponents of inclusive classroom placement expound inclusive classrooms allow students with learning disabilities to engage in enhanced learning via emersion into the regular education population. To assess both learning environments, disaggregated data from the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) were collected from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. A total of 23,647 Communication Arts scores and 23,633 Mathematics scores were collected from 2008 and 2009. Student MAP scores were grouped into three time classifications: students placed in inclusive classes for >79%, 40–79%, and <40% of the school day. Then, student MAP scores were separated into two achievement levels: Below Basic/Basic and Proficient/Advanced for comparison. In addition to the MAP data, a questionnaire was e-mailed to special education directors in Missouri public schools. This questionnaire was designed to elicit input on self-contained classes versus inclusive classes from these professionals. After analyzing the data, a relationship was found between academic success on the MAP and time spent in inclusive classes. Further study should be conducted to determine the relationship between special education placement and post graduation success. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to measure the relationship between sensory disabilities and student adjustment levels for self-determination, self-esteem, cultural/disability identification, inclusion preferences, and academic achievement. The four disability groups that participated were students who were deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired. The participants were 12-21 years of age, and they attended resource room classes, self-contained classes and special schools within the NYC public schools, and one state-supported school. Student questionnaires, teacher information, and school records provided data on the eight indicators of adjustment. Mixed factorial analyses of variance were conducted to compare the scores by sensory disability group and program placement. Results indicated that there were significant differences between the sensory groups on self-determination, self-esteem, and academic achievement, and significant placement differences on academic achievement, disability identity, and student preferences for inclusive education.

AB  - The Individuals with Disabilities Act (I.D.E.A.) mandates educating the special needs child in the least restrictive environment. Therefore, there is an effort across the nation to mainstream all special education students into the regular education classroom. Some districts are beginning to implement the requirement in small increments by including learning-disabled students in the regular education setting with access to Content Mastery Classroom support. Others have included all special education students in the regular education setting with special education support in the classrooms. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two teaching methods on the academic achievement of learning-disabled high school students. Specifically, this study is designed to determine the difference in the academic performance of learning-disabled high school students enrolled in Integrated Physics and Chemistry (IPC) who received two treatment methods: the Content Mastery Instruction and the Traditional Instruction Method. Two parametric tests were used to treat the data. They were the t-Test of Independent Samples and the One-Way Analysis of Variance. The t-Test of Independent Samples examined the mean differences in the academic performance of learning-disabled high school students who received content mastery instruction and those who received traditional instruction. The One-Way Analysis of Variance was the statistical procedure used for determining whether there were statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the two groups on the dependent variable by gender, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. One of the most significant findings of the present study was the lack of influence that ethnicity had on the academic achievement of learning-disabled, high school students. The most surprising finding of the present study was the significant influence that the variable age had on the achievement level of learning-disabled students. More specifically, the older the learning-disabled student was, the higher his or her achievement level. Educators, administrators and parents must develop a functional and viable working relationship to insure that learning-disabled students receive the level of instruction they need to make the academic and social adjustments necessary for life advancements. Only through a concerted effort by all school group members can learning-disabled students get past their disabilities and become functional members in their classrooms.

AB  - In 2006, a questionnaire was sent to 160 parents of children with Down syndrome in Dutch primary education (special and regular) with a response rate of 76%. Questions were related to the child’s gender, age and school history, academic and non-academic skills, IQ, parental educational level, and the extent to which parents worked on academics with their child. In a 2010-follow-up, out of these 121 parents, 115 (95%) filled in a questionnaire on reading and school placement of 16 of these children, IQ was unknown. These children were excluded from the analysis. Controlling for reading scores at time 1 (2006) and the other 2006- variables, ANCOVA’s showed that reading scores at time 2 (2010) were higher for children the more years they had been in a regular school between time 1 (t1) and time 2 (t2). This was true for the total group and particularly for the younger children (< 9 years), whether all children or only children still in regular education in 2006 were included. Predicting change scores confirmed this advantage of regular placement, but only in the younger children. Particularly during the first years of primary school, reading development of children with Down syndrome appears to be stimulated by regular school placement.

AB  - Increasingly, children with Down syndrome are receiving their education in mainstream schools but little research has investigated whether these placements may influence language and memory development. The present study compared 22 children with Down syndrome (aged 7–14 yrs) in mainstream school placements matched for chronological age with 22 children attending special schools in a different LEA where mainstream placements were rare. The children were assessed to obtain measures of the following language and memory disabilities: receptive vocabulary; grammar comprehension; sentence repetition; digit span; face recognition; and memory for hand movements. Children in mainstream placements achieved significantly higher scores for vocabulary, grammar and digit span measures, but not for non-language-based memory measures. More importantly, even after controlling for age and receptive vocabulary, grammar understanding and digit spans were significantly greater for the mainstream children.

AB  - The Education of All Handicapped Children's Act (EHA), which became the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), was adopted and implemented nationally. In addition, as a result of various legislative acts in the 1970's and 1980's, a rapidly increasing number of deaf students are being served in a mainstream environment. This change in the way deaf students are served constitutes a growing trend in the field of deaf education. The fact that more and more deaf students are being mainstreamed means there is an increased demand for qualified sign language interpreters to serve them both in their educational classrooms as well as for activities occurring outside of the classroom. The growing trend in mainstream service provision for deaf students creates several questions: (1) How accessible is the learning environment to the deaf student who relies on a sign language interpreter?; (2) Is the visual learning environment in the classroom when a sign-language interpreter is used, the equal and fully accessible educational opportunity as envisioned by special education lawmakers?; and (3) Is the mainstream classroom the least restrictive environment for deaf students? The purpose of this research project is to investigate the amount of information deaf and hard of hearing students learn in two types of educational settings: (1) interpreted lesson and (2) lessons where direct communication is used. An interpreted setting is a classroom setting with a hearing teacher and sign language interpreter. The study includes nineteen deaf students in both interpreted and direct communication educational settings. All of the nineteen students watched three science lessons in an interpreted educational setting. In this setting, the lessons were presented by a general education science teacher with an interpreter who is certified by Registry Interpreter for the Deaf (RID). In addition, each student watched three different science lessons in a direct communication educational condition. In this setting, the lessons were presented by a deaf science and math teacher who is a native American Sign Language user. The results indicated that in general most deaf children gained more information through the direct communication compared to the interpreted educational setting.

AB  - Objective. To describe the academic profiles of adolescents with autism who have been educated in inclusive and non-inclusive settings. Method. Fifteen adolescents with autism participated in the study. Of these students, seven had been continuously enrolled in general education (inclusion) and eight in special education (non-inclusion settings). Three measures were used to document student academic achievement in inclusion and non-inclusion settings: a review of student cumulative records, achievement assessment, and observation of student engagement in learning situations. Results. Findings indicate significant between group differences in all three measures (assessment, review of records, and observation), although there were no significant differences in intelligence or adaptive behavior assessment scores for those adolescents included and not included in general education. Students who were included in general education obtained significantly higher scores on the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement, including those subtests measuring abstract and inferential skills. All students, however, had emerging academic skills as measured on this test. Furthermore, students with autism experienced different IEP goals and services when educated in general and special education. Included students had fewer IEP goals, but these goals addressed largely abstract and applied skills. Non-included students had more goals overall, and goals that targeted primarily rote and procedural skills. All students were largely unsuccessful in attaining their IEP goals. A downward shift was noted in the number of goals for all students as they entered adolescence. Finally, observations of student engagement found significant between group differences in types of activity and patterns of engagement. Included students had greater access to the core curriculum and were more passively engaged. Non-included students were more actively engaged, had extremely limited access to the core general education curriculum, and spent nearly one-third of their instructional time engaged in non-instructional activities. Conclusions. The importance of educational context is described in this study. Inclusion is associated with improved outcomes in all three measures, suggesting the value of academic inclusion for students with autism. Students shared similar characteristics, yet included students had higher achievement assessment scores, more goals reflecting higher order and applied thinking skills, and had greater access to and more participation in the core general education curriculum.

AB  - This study examines whether the self-concepts, social skills, problem behaviors, and loneliness levels of students with special educational needs (SEN) in inclusive elementary classrooms differ from those of students without special educational needs (non-SEN). This study also aimed to identify the roles of self-concept, social skills, and problem behaviors in predicting the loneliness levels of SEN students. The study group comprised 272 students (4th and 5th graders) attending inclusive elementary classrooms. A total of 140 were SEN and 132 were non-SEN students. The Social Skills and the Problem Behaviors Scales of the Social Skills Rating System-Teacher Form (SSRS-TF), the Children's Loneliness Scale (CLS), and the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (PHCSCS) were used as data collection tools. The findings showed that the self-concepts, social skills, problem behaviors, and loneliness levels of the SEN students were significantly different than those of the non-SEN students. It was also found that self-concept and social skills were significant predictors of the loneliness levels of SEN students. The findings were discussed regarding the related literature and the inclusive practices in Turkey.

AB  - This article presents the results of a study on the development of SEN children with various types of disabilities that followed a full inclusion programme in Dutch mainstream education. Children's cognitive and socio-emotional development has been measured with various tests and questionnaires. During one school year, the development of SEN pupils in mainstream classes (n = 50) was compared to their normally achieving classmates (n = 315) and to a group of SEN children in special education classes (n = 52). Statistical analyses revealed neutral and - in one case - positive effects of inclusion on cognitive development, although SEN children still lagged behind their normally achieving classmates. Analyses further indicated a negative effect on self-perception and behaviour.

AB  - The present study investigated how the educational placement in special education schools or regular schools is related to the achievement motivation of students with special educational needs (SEN). Furthermore, we examined whether the classroom social environment (i.e., class-average achievement and social support) explains potential placement differences. We compared the academic self-concept and enjoyment of learning of SEN students in special education schools (n = 420) and regular schools (n = 678) at the end of 4th grade. In line with social comparison theory, SEN students in special education schools reported higher academic self-concepts and enjoyment of learning than their peers in regular schools. Examining underlying mechanisms, class-average achievement was negatively related to SEN students' academic self-concept and enjoyment of learning. In contrast, individually perceived social support by classmates but not class-average social support was positively associated with SEN students' achievement motivation. After controlling for individual and class-average achievement, no relationship between SEN students' educational placement and achievement motivation was found. Results indicate that social comparisons with classmates may result in placement differences in SEN students' academic self-concept and enjoyment of learning.

AB  - Promoted by the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, there is a trend towards the inclusive education of students with special educational needs (SEN) in regular classrooms. The present study addresses the question if achievement differences emerge between SEN students who attend a regular primary school and those who attend a school for special education. Based on data from the IQB-Landervergleich Primarstufe 2011, a national assessment in German primary schools, the achievement of SEN students in regular schools (n = 658) was compared to the achievement of students in special schools (n = 413). Propensity score matching was applied to control for differences in achievement related characteristics between the two groups. After matching, SEN students in inclusive educational settings showed significantly higher test scores in German reading and listening comprehension as well as in mathematics than comparable SEN students in special schools. The effects were more pronounced for students with a special need of learning support than for students with speech and language-related special education support. Possible explanations for the higher achievement of SEN students in regular schools and for differential effects with regard to type of SEN are discussed.

(English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Im Zuge der Umsetzung der UN-Behindertenrechtskonvention werden zunehmend Bemühungen unternommen, Schülerinnen und Schüler mit sonderpädagogischem Förderbedarf (SPF) inklusiv bzw. integrativ an Regelschulen zu unterrichten. Die vorliegende Studie untersucht im Primarbereich, ob sich die Kompetenzen von Schülern mit SPF an Regel- und Förderschulen unterscheiden. Anhand von Daten des bundesweiten IQB-Ländervergleichs Primarstufe 2011 werden die mit standardisierten Leistungstests erhobenen Kompetenzen von Kindern mit SPF an Regelschulen ( n = 658) und an Förderschulen ( n = 413) verglichen. Um für bestehende Gruppenunterschiede in Merkmalen zu kontrollieren, die für Schulleistungen relevant sind, wird ein Propensity Score Matching-Verfahren eingesetzt. Nach dem Matching zeigt sich, dass Kinder mit SPF an Grundschulen signifikant höhere Kompetenzwerte im Lesen, Zuhören und in Mathematik aufweisen als vergleichbare Schüler an Förderschulen. Die Effekte sind besonders ausgeprägt für Kinder mit dem Förderschwerpunkt Lernen, weniger prägnant hingegen für Kinder mit dem Förderschwerpunkt Sprache. Mögliche Erklärungsansätze für die höheren schulischen Kompetenzen von Kindern mit SPF in Regelschulen und Unterschiede in Abhängigkeit vom Förderschwerpunkt werden diskutiert.

AB  - In addressing an issue rarely explored in research literature, the prevalence and severity of the risk of being bullied at school was measured in 100 children (aged 11-yrs) with specific language impairment (SLI). Participants attended a range of different educational placement types and these were compared for bullying risk. Furthermore, the risk encountered by children with SLI was compared with that of normally developing age-matched peers. Each participant completed a questionnaire and it was found that 36% of participants with SLI considered themselves at risk of being bullied in school compared with only 12% of the normally developing cohort. No statistically significant difference was found between the risk experienced by participants with SLI attending mainstream education and that by participants attending special education placements. Possible explanations for the results are offered and the relevance of the findings in the context of optimizing the educational experience of children with SLI is highlighted.

AB  - Traditional thinking around the education of children with specific language impairment (SLI) generally considered specialised educational provision to be a short-term requirement. However, the emergence of studies indicating that many children with SLI continue to experience linguistic, social and academic difficulties throughout school life, even following periods of intensive provision and therapy, has meant that the issues concerning the education of children with SLI are now a longer-term concern. Most outcome studies of children with SLI examine academic abilities using measures that limit the direct relevance and applicability of their findings in the present educational system serving the English SLI population. In addressing the existing dearth of research concerning educational attainments as measured through formal educational assessments, the present study examined the performance of children with SLI in National Curriculum Key Stage 2 (KS2) assessments of key curricular subjects. Furthermore, in exploring the educational achievements of children with SLI, the present study also acknowledged the importance of the educational context as a forum for social learning and development and therefore established as its second aim, an examination of the social profiles of children with SLI at 11 years. One hundred children (86 boys and 14 girls), who previously had all been in fulltime attendance at specialist provision in the form of language units, participated in the study. The sample of participants were recruited in their final year of primary school education (Year 6) and were divided into two groups defined by the nature of their current educational placement. The Mainstream Education group (mean age: 130 months) comprised 50 children attending mainstream education with or without some level of additional support. The Special Education group (mean age: 131 months) consisted of 50 children attending special education in the form of either a language unit, a language school, or a special school. The two groups were matched for ability on a series of cognitive and linguistic measures. Both groups presented with expressive and receptive language difficulties (below 1sd from the population mean) and non-verbal IQ scores and short-term memory abilities within the normal range. Participants' performance in the National Curriculum KS2 assessments was measured, together with an examination of assessment procedures, such as test entry and the application of special testing arrangements. It was found that participants performed poorly relative to national levels of expectation and achievement across the curricular subjects of English, mathematics and science in both KS2 tests and teacher assessments. The Mainstream Education group of participants was found to perform significantly better than the Special Education group in the mathematics and science tests. It was also revealed that a considerable proportion of children from both educational placement groups were not entered to take the tests. Furthermore, special arrangements were made for a large number of participants who did take the tests. The assessment outcomes and procedures are discussed in terms of the testing demands placed on the skills of children with SLI, the impact of educational failure on the SLI population, the implications concerning the accessibility of National Curriculum studies and assessments to children with SLI and the differences observed between educational placement groups. The social-behavioural profiles of the participants were measured using teacher- and participant-response questionnaires. Various domains of social competence and social relationships were measured in the participants, as were the levels of emotional and behavioural difficulties that are commonly experienced by children with SLI and which may be considered to impact upon their social and educational performance. The risk encountered by children with SLI of experiencing bullying behaviour in school was also measured and compared with that of normally developing peers. Although the majority of participants were not found to experience significant social-behavioural difficulties in the school setting, the findings of the present study indicate that children with SLI are more susceptible to such problems than their normally developing peers. An alarming proportion of participants considered themselves to be at risk of being bullied. Implications of the incidence rate of particular social-behavioural problems and victimisation are discussed in relation to the social and educational development and performance of children with SLI in the school setting, and in terms of the differences and similarities observed between the profiles of the two educational placement groups. With regard to the overall findings of the present study, recommendations are made for improving the educational experience of children with SLI.

AB  - One important issue of the current empirical research on special education is the investigation of the effects of inclusive education compared to segregating education for students with learning disabilities (LD). For this purpose, measurement instruments have to be appropriate for students with LD and measurement equivalent across students with LD in different educational settings in order to be able to compare their outcomes. The aim of this study therefore was to investigate the PIQ’s (Perceptions of Inclusion Questionnaire) measurement invariance for students with LD in special and inclusive classes. Findings suggest that students with LD struggle with negative wordings. As part of multiple group analyses, partial measurement invariance of the PIQ for students with LD in special and inclusive classes could be confirmed.

AB  - The paper presents the results of a survey of 755 parents of learning disabled children with certified special needs who either attended classes within regular education or special schools. All parents were involved in the decision on the school placement of their children. The experiences of 547 parents of learning disabled students in inclusive classes were contrasted with those of 207 parents of children in special schools. Besides a rather high satisfaction with previous school experiences of their children a number of differences between the two groups of parents could be observed. Parents of students in special schools viewed their children as rather little challenged by their educational requirements whereas those in inclusive education found their children to be overtaxed. The social development of the students in inclusive education was judged as more positive and, generally, a higher rate of parents of learning disabled students in inclusive classes were satisfied with their choice of the educational setting. Although the requirements for parental support concerning studying were higher in inclusive classes this cannot solely explain the differences of experiences with school. In a second step, satisfied parents were compared to dissatisfied parents. It could be found that the group of dissatisfied parents had to make their choice on the educational setting of their children under less favourable conditions and many could not accept that their child had been classified as having special needs. This applied to parents of students in inclusive education as well as to parents of children in special schools. Additionally, parents of students with German as a second language reported to be discontented more frequently. No significant discrepancies could be found between different grades or federal states with different quotas of inclusive education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: This study examined early predictors of and changes in school‐age academic achievement and class placement in children referred for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at age 2. Method: Of 111 ASD referrals, 74 were diagnosed with ASD at age 18. Regression analyses were performed to identify age 3 predictors of achievement in arithmetic, passage comprehension, word reading, and spelling at ages 9 and 18. Linear Mixed Models were used to examine predictors of academic growth between ages 9 and 18. Results: Academic skills varied widely at 9 and 18, but were mostly commensurate with or higher than expected given cognitive levels. However, 22% (age 9) and 32% (age 18) of children with average/above average IQ showed below/low average achievement in at least one academic domain. Children who remained in general education/inclusion classrooms had higher achievement than those who moved to special education classrooms. Stronger cognitive skills at age 3 and 9 predicted better academic achievement and faster academic growth from age 9 to 18. Parent participation in intervention by age 3 predicted better achievement at age 9 and 18. Conclusions: Many children with ASD achieve basic academic skills commensurate with or higher than their cognitive ability. However, more rigorous screening for learning difficulties may be important for those with average cognitive skills because a significant minority show relative academic delays. Interventions targeting cognitive skills and parent participation in early treatment may have cascading effects on long‐term academic development.

AB  - Not all students with disabilities receive special education accommodations in science class. Without special education support, students with disabilities are unable to comprehend and apply science concepts. Implementing a co-teaching model could be a remedy for this lack of supports. Framed by constructivist theory, this study sought to determine if there was a difference in science assessment scores between students in a co-taught science class and those in a regular education science class. Following a pretest-posttest control group design, this study examined the relation between two teaching models and achievement in science. Using a convenience sample of 84 students drawn from a population of 144 fourth grade special education students in a public school district located in the Southeastern United States, analysis of variance was used to compare the mean growth of the two groups. The data revealed no statistically significant difference in mean gain scores between the two groups. Additional studies using a larger sample and longer trial are needed. Implications for social change include understanding instructional strategies that allow educators to differentiate for diverse learners in mainstreamed classrooms as well as removing barriers for underrepresented groups, thereby allowing equal access to science related professions.

AB  - A policy of inclusion has led to the growth in the number of pupils with special educational needs enrolling in mainstream schools in Ireland in recent years. However, a trend has developed whereby an increasing number of pupils with mild general learning disabilities (MGLD) are leaving mainstream primary and post-primary schools and transferring to special schools for pupils with MGLD. In this paper, the findings of a study that explored the perspectives of a cohort of principals, teachers, parents and pupils on differences in educational provision between mainstream and special schools, shed some light on the reasons why some pupils with MGLD do not continue with their education in mainstream schools. A multiple case study design was employed, with four special schools for pupils with MGLD participating as cases in this study. Differences relating to curricular provision, resource allocation and teacher expertise are outlined and discussed in the context of dilemmas of difference which arise when social values underpinning a policy of inclusion appear to conflict with one another. The findings highlight dilemmas in the areas of curriculum, placement and identification. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Summary: Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychological and physical well-being in 6–11-year-old hearing-impaired children. Methods: The cohort consisted of 70 boys and 61 girls who either attended a special school for deaf children (n =78) or a mainstream school (n =53). We used the FKSI (Frankfurt Self-Concept Scales for Children). Results: Children in special schools saw themselves in a less favourable light than children in mainstream schools. They were less confident and less assertive. They reached lower scores in making friends, and were more anxious and sad. Children attending mainstream schools were found to be more self-confident the more pronounced the hearing loss was, but reported lower well-being in higher classes. The physical well-being, however, was not affected in children with hearing impairment. Conclusions: Differences in the self-perception of hearing-impaired children and normal-hearing children must be taken into consideration when making a decision about the appropriate type of school for these individuals.

AB  - The article deals with the development of inclusive, special and integrated education in regions of the Russian Federation which is connected with socio-cultural changes in modern education. The author underlines the need for continuous improvement of education system and education of children with different development level. The expansion of educational opportunities for children with disabilities and the opportunity to choose the educational path determine the need for an experimental study of factors affecting the success of learning in different educational models. Therefore the article aims to explore self-regulation development of students with intellectual disabilities throughout adolescence ontogeny. The leading methods in the study of this problem are the experimental method, the age method, the comparative analysis method. They allow investigating the following features of the self-regulation structural components: reflection, values, and self-attitude. Also they provide a dynamic system of personal control of teenagers with intellectual disabilities. The author proves that individual self-regulation is in a sensitive period of development throughout adolescence ontogeny. Developmental disability influences its formation, leads to the regulatory system collapse and severe difficulties while teaching young people with intellectual disabilities in an inclusive model. The article may be useful for bachelors and masters of major "Education and pedagogical sciences", for researchers dealing with inclusion issues, and for the teachers while organizing the learning process of adolescents with intellectual disabilities.

AB  - Prior to 1973, slow learners were considered to fall within the borderline mental retardation range and qualified for special education services. Due to legislative and bureaucratic revisions in classification categories and eligibility criteria, the borderline mental retardation category was eliminated. Therefore, in 'theory' and according to State eligibility criteria, slow learners should receive their education in traditional education programs where they must compete with students of all other ability levels and meet standards established for the average student. There is however, much research to support that in fact many slow learners do receive special education services within the Learning Disabled category. Current research addressing the efficacy of special education versus regular education for the slow learner, specifically, is virtually nonexistent. Therefore, this study was designed to determine if there were differences in the school performance of slow learners who qualify for and receive special education services as learning disabled compared to slow learners who do not qualify for special education services. Statistical analysis suggested that the difference in school performance between these two groups is negligible. Special education services are not positively influencing the school performance of the slow learners who receive services as learning disabled compared to slow learners not receiving services, contrary to the research hypotheses. Results of this study suggest, that neither group of slow learners is 'successful' in school. Both groups are struggling to earn passing grades, score within the average range on standardized achievement testing, earn sufficient credits to be promoted each year in high school, and pass the high school proficiency exam. The conclusion of this study offers the proposal that regular education, competing with same-age peers and graduating with a regular diploma, is not a realistic option for the slow learner. However, special education is not the answer either, unless graduation with an adjusted diploma is the only goal. Instead, a focus on vocational based programs is put forward to educators as an alternative, in order to rescue the slow learner from 'falling through the cracks' for another quarter century.

AB  - After several failed attempts to rein in the growth of special education, the Dutch government made a start in 1991 with a policy to accommodate pupils with problems in regular education and to put a stop to the growth of special education. This paper examines a large-scale study conducted by our research group at the University of Amsterdam which attempted to answer the question whether pupils with problems are better off in special education where there are more resources and they can get more attention than in mainstream schools. It was expected that the pupils in special education would do better due to the specialist care and individual attention. However, with a few exceptions, few differences were found when comparable at-risk pupils in regular schools were compared with their counterparts in both types of special schools. There was a conspicuously large measure of variability in both regular and special education. All school types had both at-risk pupils who were doing well from an academic and/or psychosocial perspective and pupils whose progress left much to be desired. There is little evidence to support the idea that at-risk pupils make less progress, in either their academic or psychosocial development, in regular schools compared with pupils in special schools. The general assumption that at-risk pupils will do better in special education does not seem to account for its attractiveness. Contrary to the policy theory, the dual system, as it exists in The Netherlands, does not appear to be an obstacle to the provision of adequate care for pupils with special educational needs. However, the policy to equip regular schools to accommodate this category of pupils appears not to be realized as simply as that. It has not proved possible to demonstrate the effects of the varying levels of specialist help provided by regular schools on the development of at-risk pupils.

AB  - To follow up the school/educational status of children with a primary diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), who had been enrolled in an Early Intervention (EI) program for 1-3 y, before the age of 6. Data was collected through a questionnaire covering three specific areas-the families' success in following the recommendation given on completion of the EI program, issues in schooling and feedback on the EI program. The contact modes included email, post, telephonic interviews and face-to-face interviews. One hundred and two of the 296 children responded to the questionnaire. The responses were analyzed to identify, the number of families who had completed the program and were able to follow through with the recommendation given on completion of the EI program, difficulties faced if any, family feedback on the program and the additional help that they would have liked to receive. The reasons for failure to comply with the recommendations were analyzed. Of the 102 children who responded seven had dropped out midway through the program and 10 had discontinued after one year. Of the remaining 85 who completed the program, 71 were advised mainstreaming (83.5 %) and 14 were advised special school (16.5 %). Sixty-five of the 71 children, who were advised to enroll their child in the mainstream, were in regular school. 76.5 % of the children who completed the EI program were integrated in regular schools, 2 to 7 y after having completed the program. EI helps in enrolment and retention of substantial numbers of children with ASD in mainstream schools.

AB  - We compared threats of violence made by K--12 students in special education (120 cases) or general education (136 cases) in schools that were implementing threat assessment guidelines for managing student threats of violence (Cornell, Sheras, Kaplan, McConville, Posey, Levy-Elkon, et al., 2004; Cornell & Sheras, in press). Students in special education made disproportionately more threats, as well as more severe threats, than peers in general education. Students classified as emotionally disturbed (ED) exhibited the highest threat rates. Nevertheless, use of school suspension as a disciplinary consequence for threats was consistent for students in special and general education, and few students were expelled. Our findings support the use of threat assessment to manage threats of violence by students in special education.

AB  - There has been a push in recent years for students with disabilities to be educated alongside their typically developing peers, a practice called inclusion. In this study, we sought to determine whether peer effects operate within early-childhood special-education (ECSE) classrooms in which preschoolers with disabilities are educated alongside typical peers. Peer effects specific to language growth were assessed for 670 preschoolers (mean age = 52 months) in 83 ECSE classrooms; 55% of the children had disabilities. We found that the average language skills of classmates, as assessed in the fall of the year, significantly predicted children's language skills in the spring (after controlling for their relative skill level in the fall); in addition, there was a significant interactive effect of disability status (i.e., the presence or absence of a disability) and peers' language skills. Peer effects were the least consequential for children without disabilities whose classmates had relatively strong language skills, and the most consequential for children with disabilities whose classmates had relatively poor language skills.

AB  - Many schools utilize coteaching to educate students both with and without disabilities and to provide instruction for students with disabilities from a special education teacher. Research supports the benefits of coteaching, but few studies have quantified the effects of coteaching on reading achievement. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to compare reading achievement between 9 coteach and 9 general education K-2 classrooms in 3 elementary schools. This study was based on Vygotsky's social development theory. Research questions explored whether a significant difference existed between coteach and general education classrooms on Texas Primary Reading Inventory (TPRI) reading change scores of students with and without disabilities. TPRI reading change scores were analyzed using ANOVA and descriptive statistics. Results showed a significant difference between coteach and general education classrooms on reading change scores for the combined scores of students with and without disabilities; however, results for students with disabilities failed to show a significant difference between coteach and general education classrooms on reading change scores. Findings indicated that students with disabilities did not perform differently in reading in coteach classrooms. Moreover, students without disabilities improved significantly in their reading performance. Recommendations for action include implementing coteaching in all grades regardless of students' abilities and assisting faculty in implementing coteaching instruction. Implications for positive social change include integration of students regardless of ability in classrooms where students can attain improved social skills and experience peer acceptance in an inclusive learning environment.

AB  - Aims: The study aims at the exploration of reading development of typically developing students and students with mild intellectual disabilities (MID). Methodology: A total of 1550 students from grades 3, 5 and 7 participated in the cross-sectional data collection. 610 participants were students with MID. Grade 3 children with MID were from general education or special education classes, while MID students from grade 5 and 7 all attended special schools. Word reading and reading comprehension tests were used to assess reading achievement. Students also filled in a questionnaire of reading motivation and background data. Reliability indices of the measures were high for both samples. Results: Word reading and reading comprehension of students with MID develop significantly from grade 3 to grade 7. In grade 7 the difference between the developmental level of typically developing students and of those with MID is smaller than that in grade 3. Reading motivation decreases with age for both samples, however, for students with MID the change in motivation between grade 3 and 7 is smaller. For both MID and typically developing students, reading motivation shows a significant weak correlation with reading achievement. A moderate correlation was found between the reading performance of typically developing students and their IQ and mothers’ level of education. However, reading achievement of children with MID is not related to the mothers’ level of education and is only weakly correlated with IQ. Students with MID from integrated classrooms scored significantly higher on the reading tests than children from special education classes, but achieved significantly lower than their non-disabled peers. Integration into mainstream education classes has no positive effect on reading motivation. Findings of the study has significant implications for the practice of reading instruction and the integration of students with MID into mainstream education.

AB  - In an effort to improve academic performance for students receiving special education services, a large urban school district in Tennessee has implemented Integrated Service Delivery Model. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of students receiving instruction in self-contained classrooms to the performance of students receiving instruction in inclusive classrooms. School attendance, number of suspension days, number of disciplinary referrals, reading achievement, and math achievement were compared between the two groups. Participants were purposefully sample selected middle schools that provide special education services to address social, emotional, and behavioral deficit areas. The sample consisted of 103 middle school special education students in grades five through eight who receive moderate intervention services (MIS) for social, emotional, and/or behavioral deficit areas. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare the means of students receiving MIS in inclusive classrooms to the means of students receiving MIS services in self-contained classrooms for number of suspensions, reading achievement, and math achievement variables. Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare mean ranks of students receiving MIS in inclusive classrooms to mean ranks of students receiving MIS services in self-contained classrooms for differences in attendance and number of disciplinary referrals. All inferential tests were compared against the standard probability level (p) of .05. Of the five null hypotheses explored, there were no statistically significant differences in the performance of middle school students receiving MIS services in self-contained classrooms compared to middle school students receiving MIS services in inclusion classrooms in regards to attendance, number of suspension days, reading achievement, math achievement, and number of disciplinary referrals. Based upon the findings of this research, recommendations for practice support the need for a continuum of services to be provided for special education students with social, emotional, and/or behavioral issues. This research compares data obtained after two years of implementation of an Integrated Service Delivery model. Future research should replicate this study to measure student performance after five years of implementation of this Integrated Service Delivery model; for elementary, high school, or even across tiers for this population of students.

AB  - Compared were the characteristics of 60 learning disabled (LD) and 60 normal children (all between 8- and 11-years-old) participating in the Georgia Reading Research Program. The target group consisted of LD children who showed deficits in the psychological process of ordering/sequencing; while the LD reference group were average or above average in ordering/sequencing abilities. Instruments used to assess these deficits were the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Sequencing Triad and the Wide Range Achievement Spelling Test. Other differences between the two groups were that the target group had instructional reading levels one or more years below their expected grade placement levels and were enrolled in special classes; while the LD reference children were enrolled in regular classes and were reading within six months of expected grade level. The program was to focus on an evaluation of specific curriculum treatments designed to facilitate reading achievement. (Author/DB)

AB  - This study attempted to determine the problem of unpredictable academic results in math and reading on district assessments of students with disabilities at different intellectual and academic ability levels receiving special education services. This non-experimental quantitative multiple regression analysis included individual verbal comprehension index (VCI), perceptual reasoning index (PRI), working memory index (WMI), processing speed Index (PSI), composite or broad academic achievement scores in reading and math and the amount of service time in general education or pull-out placement settings as predictor variables of increased achievement in math and reading scores on district assessments. The study utilized archived historical data of 165 students with various disabilities in grades six, seven and eight from four middle schools in one Southwestern school district to determine if specific cognitive and academic levels and the amount of service time predicted academic success for students with disabilities in an inclusive environment. The historical data across the six school years provided a sample of 399 records (n=399). The results of this study provide quantitative data to support the placement and amount of service time for students with disabilities with different ability levels. The results of the regression analysis did not reveal a significant relationship between the amount of special education service time provided to students with disabilities placed in an inclusive general education classroom setting and formal district academic assessment scale scores in reading ( B = -0.04, p = .403) or math (B = 0.01, p = .873). The results did indicate that PRI ( B = 1.14, p = .018) and math score (B = 1.26, p = .010) were significant positive predictors of math scale scores and the reading score x WMI interaction was significant (B = 0.10, p = .030), indicating that students with high reading scores tended to have high math scale scores if their WMI was also high. No other predictors were significant. The outcome suggests that a decision of placement in inclusion based on the disability eligibility is not always effective. It is recommended that the individual's cognitive and academic assessments scores used to determine special education eligibility should be used when making decisions on placement.

AB  - This study explored the impact of inclusion on learning support students in a middle school setting. The major research question in this study related to the impact inclusion models of instruction have on the standardized test scores of students with a specific learning disability. The inclusion of special education students in general education settings has been a controversial issue for some time now. This study was important because more special education students are being included in these classes as a result of No Child Left Behind. Data pertaining to 27 current 7th and 8th grade students was obtained over a 2 year period of time, using the Single-Group Interrupted Time-Series design. Age, attendance, math and reading grade equivalence along with percentage of time students were exposed to a general education curriculum were analyzed using the Pearson Correlation to determine if there was a correlation between those variables and scores on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment. A positive correlation was determined to exist between test scores of learning support students and the percentage of time they were exposed to an educational placement with their non-disabled peers. Data pertaining to age and attendance did not reveal a significant correlation. The results of this study have provided implications for positive social change in that students with disabilities should be provided more opportunities to be included with their non-disabled peers in K-12 school environments; their inclusion has the potential to increase student achievement.

AB  - This study explored the impact of inclusion on learning support students in a middle school setting. The major research question in this study related to the impact inclusion models of instruction have on the standardized test scores of students with a specific learning disability. The inclusion of special education students in general education settings has been a controversial issue for some time now. This study was important because more special education students are being included in these classes as a result of No Child Left Behind. Data pertaining to 27 current 7th and 8th grade students was obtained over a 2 year period of time, using the Single-Group Interrupted Time-Series design. Age, attendance, math and reading grade equivalence along with percentage of time students were exposed to a general education curriculum were analyzed using the Pearson Correlation to determine if there was a correlation between those variables and scores on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment. A positive correlation was determined to exist between test scores of learning support students and the percentage of time they were exposed to an educational placement with their non-disabled peers. Data pertaining to age and attendance did not reveal a significant correlation. The results of this study have provided implications for positive social change in that students with disabilities should be provided more opportunities to be included with their non-disabled peers in K-12 school environments; their inclusion has the potential to increase student achievement.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify if there is a relationship between student placement within the special education continuum and academic growth in the area of mathematics at the ninth-grade level. In order to achieve this overall objective, the following research questions framed this quantitative study: (1) To what extent do IEP-eligible students in a ninth-grade, self-contained classroom experience significant growth in the area of mathematics? (2) To what extent do IEP-eligible students in a ninth-grade, integrated classroom experience significant growth in the area of mathematics? (3) How does academic placement within the special education continuum impact the academic growth in the area of mathematics for ninth-grade IEP-eligible students? This study utilized a quantitative analysis to gather growth data from Northwest Evaluation Association's (NWEA) Measure of Academic Progress (MAP) over the course of a three-year period (2015--16, 2016--17, and 2017--18 school year). Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized to explain and assist the researcher in answering each of the three guiding research questions. A dependent t-test was conducted to help answer the first two research questions. The dependent t-test allowed the researcher to determine if the academic growth observed in each of the settings (self-contained and integrated) was statistically significant in the area of mathematics. The third and final research question utilized a one-way ANOVA to determine if a relationship existed between special education placement and academic growth. The results of this study demonstrated that IEP-eligible students in both an integrated and self-contained mathematics classroom experienced significant growth when comparing fall to spring NWEA MAP assessment data. However, there was not a statistically significant difference in academic growth when comparing IEP-eligible students between settings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A special education population failed to meet the state target in English. This occurrence drove educational leaders to review their program options to address the problem. Their decision to offer a partial inclusion English program setting is important because it supports using data to provide students a Free and Appropriate Education (FAPE) in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). The purpose of this study was to examine if the new setting was supported by an increase in student academic achievement scores. The theoretical framework included the social relationship model by Reindal and Gürgür and Uzuner's successful inclusion practices theory. The guiding research question addressed the influence of a self-contained setting for English, replacing the general education class offered for special education students on California Modified Assessment (CMA) English scores. A comparative quantitative pre- and posttest design study was conducted using a before-and-after sequence of events (partial-inclusion implementation) and included a sample size of 8 participants. A Friedman Test was followed up with the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test to complete the data analysis. Findings showed noteworthy differences between 2 or more of the mean scores, and scores in 2013 were higher than scores in 2012. The resulting project is a training session on the implemented intervention Read Naturally, which was supported in the data analysis. Recommendations include providing technical support and time management strategies for staff. Implications for positive social change support provision of settings and supportive reading strategies to meet the needs of individual special education students. This support will ensure students' placement into the least restrictive environment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Remarkably few studies have investigated the nature and origin of learning difficulties in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Aims: To investigate math achievement in terms of word-problem solving ability in children with CP and controls. Because of the potential importance of reading for word-problem solving, we investigated reading as well. Sample: Children with CP attending either special (n = 41) or mainstream schools (n = 16) and a control group of typically developing children in mainstream schools (n = 16). Method: Group differences in third grade math and reading, controlled for IQ, were tested with analyses of co-variance (ANCOVAs). Hierarchical regression was used to investigate cognitive correlates of third grade math and reading. Predictors included verbal and non-verbal IQ measured in first grade, components of working memory (WM) and executive function (EF) measured in second grade, and arithmetic fact fluency and reading measured in third grade. Results: Children with CP in special schools performed significantly worse than their peers on word-problem solving and reading. There was a trend towards worse performance in children with CP in mainstream schools compared to typically developing children. Conclusions: Impairments of non-verbal IQ and WM updating predicted future difficulties in both word-problem solving and reading. Impairments of visuospatial sketchpad and inhibition predicted future word-problem, but not reading difficulty. Conversely, deficits of phonological loop predicted reading but not word-problem difficulty. Concurrent arithmetic fact fluency and reading ability were both important for word-problem solving ability. These results could potentially help to predict which children are likely to develop specific learning difficulties, facilitating early intervention.

AB  - The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the quality of arithmetic education for children with cerebral palsy. The use of individual educational plans, amount of arithmetic instruction time, arithmetic instructional grouping, and type of arithmetic teaching method were explored in three groups: children with cerebral palsy (CP) in special (CP-special; n = 41) and mainstream schools (CP-mainstream; n = 16) and a control group in mainstream schools (n = 16). The majority of individual educational plans did not include well-formulated arithmetic goals and many were not based on optimal assessment. Special schools scheduled much less arithmetic instruction time. Many CP-mainstream children received individualized instruction, which may help to explain why their arithmetic performance did not differ from controls. Remedial arithmetic teaching methods used in special schools did not seem to be optimal, but more research is required. Suggestions to improve arithmetic education to children with CP were discussed.

AB  - Arithmetic ability was tested in children with cerebral palsy without severe intellectual impairment (verbal IQ >= 70) attending special (n = 41) or mainstream education (n = 16) as well as control children in mainstream education (n = 16) throughout first and second grade. Children with cerebral palsy in special education did not appear to have fully automatized arithmetic facts by the end of second grade. Their lower accuracy and consistently slower (verbal) response times raise important concerns for their future arithmetic development. Differences in arithmetic performance between children with cerebral palsy in special or mainstream education were not related to localization of cerebral palsy or to gross motor impairment. Rather, lower accuracy and slower verbal responses were related to differences in nonverbal intelligence and the presence of epilepsy. Left-hand impairment was related to slower verbal responses but not to lower accuracy.

AB  - This quantitative study sought to determine whether there were significant statistical differences between the performance scores of special education and general education students’ scores when in team or solo-teaching environments as may occur in inclusively taught classrooms. The investigated problem occurs because despite education’s stated intent to bring the best types of education to students issues such as funding, scheduling, and other limited resources drive instructional decisions despite the need for more quantitative research, which illustrates the need for better classroom to student instruction. In this study, both team and solo-teaching employ inclusion in the classrooms where students classified as special education and general education shared the same classroom at the same time. Many times two teaching professionals were used, which is designated as team-teaching, while at other times only one teacher conducts the classroom’s learning environment, which is called solo-teaching. The study incorporated a pretest and posttest format. Special education performance scores include only those illustrating participation in the same assessment and the same instructional method as general education students, and who attended school to graduate from high school. The results of the study indicating significant statistical differences were only present in the students’ performance scores based on whether or not those students were classified as regular or special education. Of significant note was the determination that the instructional methodology played a lesser role in determining students’ assessment results than previously suggested, possibly due to deviation from pre-defined team-teaching configurations.

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative retrospective quasi-experimental study was to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between sixth, seventh, and eighth grade special education students receiving multiple instructional strategies and sixth, seventh, and eighth grade students receiving traditional instructional strategies. This study was based on the previously taken standardized Criterion Referenced Competency Test in reading. The study took place in a Southwest Georgia School District. Multiple instructional strategies such as small groups and computerized reading lessons were used in the inclusion-reading classrooms. The reading teachers believed the inclusion model would not be beneficial. The researcher examined one main research question with supporting hypotheses. The main research question was answered whether there is a statistically significant difference between students receiving multiple instructional strategies and students receiving traditional instructional strategies. The experimental group for this study received inclusion instruction while the controlled group received traditional instruction. A data analysis was completed and based on the findings, students receiving traditional instruction achieved a mean score of 830. The inclusion students receiving multiple instruction achieved a mean score of 818. Despite the difference in mean scores, the inclusion students were also successful. The researcher focused on the issue to show there are positive outcomes from implementing inclusion. Recommendations involving a reading intervention such as guided reading groups, backwards design planning, and collaborative instruction were noted. A one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) analysis tested significance and two-way ANOVA tested interaction. Both analyses were set at the .05 significance level to interpret the data.

AB  - We investigate whether the academic performance of non-eligible students--in an institutional setting of full inclusion--are affected by special education resources. Special education resources are per definition provided in a compensatory manner, and are increasingly being targeted to misbehaving students. The hypothesis is thus that special education resources might dampen the negative externalities associated with misbehaving students, and thus work to improve the performance of non-eligible students. We take advantage of a large, across-the-board increase in the proportion of eligible students, and combine fixed effects with an IV-approach, to identify the causal effects of special education on the academic performance of non-eligible students. We find that non-eligible students are positively affected by an increase in the number of hours in special education per eligible student.

AB  - Inclusive education for Children with Special Needs (CWSN), as an approach, seeks to address the learning needs of all children with disabilities. It implies that all learners with disabilities are able to learn together with non-disabled children through access to common schools and community educational setting with an appropriate network of support services. Chetana Institute for the Mentally Handicapped, Bhubaneswar, promoted inclusive education of children with special needs under the Community Based Rehabilitation Programme implemented in several Blocks of Orissa. A study was conducted to assess the effect of inclusive education programme on the education and development children with intellectual disability in regular primary schools. The results revealed a positive effect of Inclusive Education Programme on the children with intellectual disability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Students with disabilities have traditionally achieved to a lesser degree than have their nondisabled peers. Since the 1950s the federal government has enacted laws to provide free, appropriate public education to students with disabilities. In the first decade of the 21st Century the government has produced legislation requiring schools to be responsible for improving instruction for students with disabilities. One of the major trends in accomplishing this task is a move toward inclusive education. This study determined the relationships of assessment type (Standards of Learning (SOL) assessments versus Virginia Grade Level Alternative (VGLA) assessments) and models of service delivery (general education inclusion classes versus special education pullout classes) for students with disabilities in grades 3 through 8 on student achievement in 4 counties in Southwest Virginia. Similar studies have been conducted with varying results noted. The review of the literature includes 18 studies that compared the achievement of students with disabilities who were instructed in the general education classroom with the achievement of students with disabilities who were instructed in the special education classroom. Significant differences were noted in 11 of the reviewed studies. The data were analyzed using chi-square analysis and pairwise comparisons. The findings indicate that there is a relationship between instructional delivery method (inclusion or pullout) and proficiency in reading and math. Students who were educated in the inclusion classrooms tended to have a higher incidence of pass proficient ratings and students in the pullout classrooms tended to have a higher incidence of pass advanced ratings. The findings also indicate that there is a relationship between assessment method (SOL assessment or VGLA) and proficiency in reading and math. Students who were assessed via the SOL assessment tended to have a higher incidence of pass proficient ratings and students who were assessed via the VGLA assessment tended to have a higher incidence of pass advanced ratings.

AB  - Inclusion programs were implemented to assist special needs students in the classroom both academically and socially. Much conflict and frustration have occurred as a result of the implementation of these programs in the regular classroom setting. More guidance and professional development of teachers were needed to make these programs more effective in meeting the needs of the special needs students being served in these programs. The need for a more structured and effective inclusion program has emerged. This study investigated the Group Inclusive Model (GIM) as such a program. This program involves grouping students academically within the regular classroom setting (which is the classroom where all non-disabled students are served on a daily basis) and providing strategies within these groups to ensure the success of the special needs students academically. The sample used for this study came from two rural schools. The treatment groups at each school consisted of 20 students in both Reading and Math. The control group at School 1 consisted of 13 students in Math and 19 students in Reading. The control group at School 2 consisted of 20 students in Math and 19 students in Reading. In this study, the S.T.A.R. Reading and STAR Math Assessments (Ysseldyke, Samuels, Topping, McBride, Brem. & Algozzine, 2005) were used to collect students' reading and math achievement scores before and after instruction using the Group Inclusive Model (GIM) and the Traditional Mainstreaming Model (TMM). The data was analyzed using 2-way Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) measuring the results of pre and post test gain scores from the S.T.A.R. Reading and STAR Math achievement tests. The first hypothesis was, there is a significant difference in academic gain scores in reading of third grade students who were taught using the Group Inclusive Model (GIM) versus third grade students who were taught using the Traditional Mainstreaming Model (TMM) in the general education classroom setting. The corresponding null hypothesis was, there is no significant difference in academic gain scores in reading when the Group Inclusive Model (GIM) was used versus the Traditional Mainstreaming Model (TMM) in grade three in the regular education classroom setting. The second hypothesis was, there is a significant difference in academic gain scores in mathematics of third grade students who were taught using the Group Inclusive Model (GIM) versus third grade students who were taught using the Traditional Mainstreaming Model (TMM) in the regular education classroom setting. The corresponding null hypothesis was, there is no significant difference in academic gain scores in mathematics when the Group Inclusive Model (GIM) was used versus the Traditional Mainstreaming Model (TMM) in grade three in the regular education setting. The data indicated that the Group Inclusive Model (treatment group) showed a significant difference on student achievement in Reading. Math gain scores were higher using the GIM versus the TMM but not a significant difference for the students being served using this model in the regular education setting.

AB  - Few studies have examined the effects of special education placement on learning disabled (LD) students as it relates to severe emotional distress, such as depression. Previous research, although scant and methodologically flawed, has suggested that a correlation exists between LD and depression (Cohen, 1985; Dalley, Bolocofsky, Alcom, & Baker, 1992; Goldstein, Paul, & Sanfillipo-Cohn, 1985; Hall & Haws, 1989; Heath & Wiener, 1996; Huntington & Bender, 1993; Maag & Behrens, 1989; Rodriguez & Routh, 1989; Stevenson & Romney, 1984). Since no studies have examined the extent to which an LD adolescent's level of depression is mediated by variables such as IQ, classroom placement, and the ability-achievement discrepancy, this study represents an initial investigation into these areas. All records of LD students in a regular, academic public high school located in New York City, New York, who had recently been evaluated were reviewed. Those who met the inclusion criteria and consented to participate were included in the study. The scores of 26 resource room students and 26 students in self-contained class settings on the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III), Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT), as measures of ability and achievement, respectively; the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II); and the Devereux Behavioral Rating Scale-School Edition. (DBRS-S), which includes a 'Depression' subscale and was administered to guidance counselors, were statistically analyzed. The results indicated that although LD students in resource room and self-contained classes did not differ in levels of depressive symptoms as determined by self-report (BDI-II), guidance counselors tended to rate LD students in resource room as more depressed than LD students in self-contained classes. Forty-five percent of the sample rated themselves with mild (or greater) levels of depressive symptomatology, and 32% rated themselves as being within the 'moderate' to 'severe' level of depressive symptoms (score of 20 or greater). Guidance counselors rated 43% of the total sample as being within the clinically significant range of severity on the DBRS-S. None of the assessed covariates, (i.e., age, gender, grade, SES) correlated with depression. IQ functioning and the ability-achievement discrepancy) did not relate significantly to depressive symptoms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This small-scale study is positioned within a social constructionist interpretive paradigm using a mixed methodology employing principles of adapted grounded theory, simple scale-based questionnaires and action research. Fourteen disabled young people from one specialist and three secondary mainstream settings were interviewed using semi-structured interviews to gain their views on friendship and belonging in schools. Three groups of parents, TAs, SENCos and allied education professionals engaged in action research to examine these views, their own views and values and those of disabled young people in their families and schools in order to better understand the sensitivities and subtleties of successful social inclusion and to consider change to whole school practice. The limitations that non-disabled adults unwittingly ‘construct’ that act as barriers to friendship and social inclusion were explicitly recognised in this interpretive research as a contribution to informing practice and theory in this domain. Paper One focuses on the views of young people and the meaning and importance they placed on friendship and social relationships in their lives. Findings included that young people in specialist and mainstream setting highly valued friendships but that sustaining friendships in the wider community was often problematic for those participants who attended schools outside their local community. This mainly affected the specialist setting students but was also recognised as an issue by some of the mainstream parents who lived outside the catchment area. Findings also revealed that young people gained their sense of belonging from the positive relationships they formed with TAs and teachers as well as friends. In order for friendship and positive social inclusion to develop, however, participants required schools to provide a supportive environment of accessible rooms, doors and lifts and adults who trusted them to have the competency and agency to manage their social times and spaces with choice and autonomy. The issue of ‘surplus visibility’ was highlighted by disabled young people who spoke of an experience of school where lack of choice concerning where and with whom to spend break times limited their friendship opportunities and sense of well-being and inclusion. This was compounded by an expectation of compliance by adults and automatic assumption of their belonging to a disabled group despite differences of sex, gender or common interests. The participants valued genuine connection through humour, interests and social support and were active in seeking private time for talking with friends. Schools that provided a range of highly social or quieter, more private, locations for students were highly valued. Paper Two describes using these views as stimulus for action research to bring about change towards improved social inclusion. Groups of parents, senior management, SENCos, TAs and other education professionals met formally three times over a four month period. These groups examined vignettes selected from data from paper one, engaged in debate and discussions, interviewed disabled young people themselves, formulated key concept maps leading to revised theoretical frameworks, reflected and evaluated the process of the action research and considered practice change or further research. This stage was a continued process of seeking to hear authentic voices, in depth discussion and reflection on what we were learning from disabled young people combined with our own knowledge, values, and beliefs. This led to the development of conceptual models and practical change intentions to promote social inclusion. Intentions to change included •Developing alternative social rooms with minimal TA presence •Including disabled young people in TA selection processes •Involving parents in reviewing the school inclusion policy •Establishing a regular parents’ support group •A commitment to keep listening to young people’s voices and preferences on key matters rather than ‘assuming that we already know!’ •Lengthening the lunch break in the specialist setting to ensure time for socialising and friendship building These commitments to change demonstrated that schools were able to engage successfully in the action research process, valued parents’contributions further and were willing to change practice towards greater social inclusion of disabled young people and parents.

AB  - This study examined the influence of socioeconomic status (SES), preschool attendance, and instructional time and strategies in first grade on special education placement in one of the judgmental categories (i.e., specific learning disability, emotional disturbance, or speech or language impairment) in third grade. It also examined the relationship between reading growth and special education status. Results indicated that when controlling for proficiency in beginning-sounds skills at kindergarten entry, only SES remained a significant predictor of special education placement. Results also indicated a statistically significant, but not practically meaningful, relationship between reading growth and special education status. Strengths and limitations of the study, as well as implications for policy and future research, are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference in Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program Modified Academic Achievement Standards (TCAP MAAS) achievement test scores for special education students who receive their instruction in the resource classroom or in an inclusion classroom. The study involved third, fourth, and fifth grade special education students in an east Tennessee school district. The TCAP MAAS scale scores used were from the 2011-2012 school year. An independent samples t-test was implemented in this study. The dependent variable in the study was the TCAP MAAS scaled scores. The independent variable was student placement. Placement was regular education inclusion or special education resource class. The study included 11 elementary schools and 210 special education students’ scores. The results indicated significantly higher TCAP MAAS scaled scores of those students receiving their instruction in a regular education inclusion classroom in every analysis except for fifth grade Reading/Language Arts scores.

AB  - This report discusses the outcomes of a study that examined four factors (academics, peer relationships, personal security, and family acceptance) as they related to the self-esteem of students with and without disabilities. The instrument used to measure these factors was the adapted Self-Esteem Inventory containing 58 questions. The survey was given to 136 students (1-7 grades), 76 were in general education settings and 60 were in education placements, in five urban schools within four districts in Maricopa County, Arizona. Results of the survey indicate that there was no significant difference in the overall self-esteem of students in general education and special education within gender, primary handicapping conditions, placement, or grade. Results of the survey relating to peer popularity indicate that all students felt equally popular with their peers. In addition, students with emotional and/or behavioral disabilities reported a more positive self-esteem in this component than other students with disabilities. Overall, personal security yielded the most negative responses of the self-esteem components. Finally, with respect to family acceptance, the study revealed that all students felt equally accepted.

AB  - In this study, socio-emotional problems of deaf or hard-of-hearing, blind or visually impaired school-aged students as well as students with intellectual impairment are discussed in the context of executive functioning and communicative competence. Executive functions were assessed for a sample of 700 students by their teachers with a German version of the 'Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF-D)', 436 of them attended a school for special needs, 264 a general school. In addition, a questionnaire measuring communicative competence was administered as well as a questionnaire on socio-emotional problems (German version of the 'Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire'; SDQ-D). The results show a significantly higher rate of problems in developing executive functions for all scales compared to students without a disability. The three groups of deaf, visually impaired, and mentally handicapped children differed significantly from each other in their executive functioning. Moreover, children from integrative school settings had fewer problems in executive functioning than children from special needs schools. A regression analysis revealed the important contribution of executive functions, in particular behaviour regulation competencies, and communicative competence to socio- emotional functioning. The relevance of the findings for educational work, especially concerning inclusive schools, is discussed. The results suggest that an early intervention concerning executive competencies would be reasonable in order to prevent behaviour difficulties.

AB  - This study investigates how the proportion of SEN students in regular classes is related to the student-level and class-level cross-curricular competences. The data (N = 5368) come from a large-scale, longitudinal assessment study conducted on students at the beginning and end of lower secondary education in a Finnish metropolitan area. The results of the multilevel regression models showed that students in regular classes with SEN students performed on average lower than students in classes without SEN students, and that the proportion of students with SEN in class weakly predicted negatively the ninth-grade test scores. Furthermore, SEN students seemed to perform at the same level regardless of the proportion of other SEN students in class. However, students without SEN in classes with SEN students performed slightly lower than their peers in classes without SEN students in the ninth-grade assessment even when the initial differences related to placement were taken into account.

AB  - Introduction: In this study, executive function of school-aged children with visual impairments (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) is examined in the context of behavioral problems and communicative competence. Methods: Teachers assessed the executive function of a sample of 226 visually impaired students from mainstream schools and schools for students who are visually impaired, using a German version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-D) and a questionnaire measuring communicative competence and behavioral problems (German version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; SDQ-D). Results: The results showed highly significant differences in all domains of executive function: the visually impaired students consistently scored more poorly compared to a normative sample of sighted children, even when visually impaired students with additional disabilities were not taken into account. A regression analysis revealed the significance of executive function for behavioral problems among students with visual impairments. Discussion: The findings demonstrate that a wide range of executive function domains that are significant for socioemotional development are not sufficiently developed in many visually impaired students. This lack of development seems to be particularly true for students who attend special schools. Implications for Practitioners: In educational concepts for visually impaired students, a specific and early focus on competencies such as attention shifting and emotional understanding seems to be necessary, especially in the context of inclusion. Moreover, reinforcing communicative competence might also enhance the development of executive function and help to reduce behavioral problems.

AB  - Research Findings: Quality of care for preschool children in inclusive and noninclusive classrooms was examined in two studies. In Study 1, comparisons across a large sample of classrooms (N = 1, 313) showed that inclusive classrooms were higher than noninclusive classrooms in global quality as well as on two dimensions of quality (Activities/Materials and Language/Interactions). In Study 2, a more diverse sample of 44 classrooms (20 inclusive and 24 noninclusive) did not reveal differences on the global measures of quality but did show a difference on a measure of teacher-child interactions. Teachers in inclusive classrooms had higher quality and more appropriate interactions with all children than did teachers from noninclusive classrooms. Ratings of perceived severity of children's disabilities were not related to any of the measures of classroom quality in either study. Practice or Policy: Both studies suggest that including children with disabilities in regular preschool classrooms does not result in lower quality programs or in less adequate teacher-child interactions, particularly for children with mild to moderate disabilities. Results illustrate the importance of continued education for early childhood professionals on high-quality teacher-child interactions. Faculty in personnel preparation programs as well as policymakers need to continue to promote high-quality interactions between teachers and children. (Contains 7 tables.)

AB  - Since ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2009, joint "same goal" and "different goal" education of pupils with and without disabilities has become a key concern of any changes in German educational policy. The lively public discourse and the controversial debate among experts have been fuelled last but not least by a lack of research and a partly conflicting interpretation of research results concerning the effects of various educational settings for pupils with SEBD (cf. Ellinger and Stein, 2012). In the international professional discourse about research on inclusion, a methodical approach incorporating the views of pupils with special educational needs has been occasionally considered. An overview of current international findings from empirical research on the "pupils voice" shows that initial--mainly regional--data are available from various countries (cf. Hartas and Geoff, 2011; O'Connor, Hodkinson, Burton, et al., 2010; Paige-Smith and Rix, 2011), although no elaborate research tradition exists yet, and that scientists agree about the need to include this perspective in research activities. On that score the aim of this research project was to investigate the attitude of affected pupils on current trends in inclusive and segregated educational settings. The study's main target group consists of pupils experiencing difficulties in their emotional and social development, as these are the pupils who are most frequently educated in inclusive/integrative school settings as compared to pupils with other special educational needs (cf. KMK-Statistik, 2014), and also as the number of schools offering special educational guidance for social, emotional and behavioural difficulties has increased by 300% in the past 15 years. In our study we explore German pupils experienced well-being in different educational settings by using two different questionnaires designed to assess psychologically and pedagogically relevant views, evaluations and attitudes of elementary school-aged children.

AB  - This study examined educational placement (special education and regular education), attributions (internal locus of control (I/LOC), external locus of control (E/LOC), stability (stable, unstable), and controllability (internal control, powerful others, unknown control) for success and failure events, and achievement. One hundred twenty, third through sixth grade students from two elementary and one middle school were administered the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire (IAR; Crandall, Katkovsky, & Crandall, 1965) and the Multidimensional Measure of Children's Perception of Control (MMCPC; Connell, 1985) during the first semester of the school year. Hotelling's T-tests were run to examine the differences between regular education and special education students' internality, externality, stability (stable, unstable), and controllability attributions (internal control, powerful others, unknown control) for success and failure events. Chi Square analysis was used to examine differences in achievement scores between special education and regular education students. One-way ANOVA's were also conducted to determine whether significant attribution (internality, externality, stability, and controllability) differences for success and failure events were related to differences in achievement scores. Data analysis revealed a significant difference between special education and regular education students' attributions for success and failure events. Results indicated that the special education students exhibit lower success attribution scores (internal, stable and unknown locus of control) and higher failure attribution scores (external and powerful others locus of control) than regular education students. Further, the results reveal significant differences in achievement and academic attributions. While there was no difference between regular and special education students and academic progress over the course of a school year, the results showed that special education students are less likely to attain the highest level of academic success. Finally, results indicated that 'Well above' and 'Above average' students are less likely to exhibit failure attributions (external failure and unknown control locus of control) than 'Below average' or 'At grade level' students. In summary, the results of this study suggest that academic attributes play a role in the attainment of academic success. Implications and recommendations for further research are presented.

AB  - Cyberbullying refers to a negative activity aimed at deliberate and repeated harm through the use of a variety of electronic media. This study examined the Internet behavior patterns and gender differences among students with learning disabilities who attended general education and special education classes, their involvement in cyberbullying, and the relationships among being cyberbullied, their responses, and their coping strategies. The sample consisted of 149 students with learning disabilities (LD) attending general education classes, 116 students with comorbid LD attending special education classes, and 242 typically achieving students. All the students, studying in middle and high schools, completed a self-report cyberbullying questionnaire. Findings indicate that although no significant differences emerged in the amount of surfing hours and students’ expertise in the use of the Internet, students attending special education classes are more likely to be cybervictims and cyberperpetrators; girls are more likely to be cybervictims, whereas boys are more likely to be cyberperpetrators. These results contribute to our understanding of students’ involvement in cyberbullying and can serve as a basis for developing preventive programs as well as intervention programs for students and for educational school teams.

AB  - The present study examined 310 students with mild intellectual disability (ID) who attended special schools and self-contained classes in mainstream schools with regard to their reports of depressive mood, and loneliness and social skills, and teachers' perception of the students' academic, social and behavioural competencies. A multivariate analysis of Variance (MANOVA) revealed that: students in special schools reported higher levels of depression and felt lonelier than mainstream school students; girls exhibited a greater sense of depressive mood than boys; teachers assessed boys as having higher academic competencies than girls; and boys were considered more easily distracted and less independent. However, teachers considered girls to have more adequate social adjustment, and be more task-oriented and more independent. For both groups, depressive mood can be predicted by distractibility and loneliness; by gender and lower academic competencies for special school students; or mainly by difficulties in social adjustment in the case of mainstream school students.

AB  - Few studies have examined the quality and the quantity of friendship as reported by students and teachers. In the present report, the author examined 575 adolescent students (aged 12.2–15.2 yrs). There were 121 adolescent students with mild mental retardation (MR) studying in special education schools, 189 students studying in self-contained classes in mainstreamed schools, and 265 nondisabled students, compared with 50 teacher reports. Results indicated significant differences in the perception of friendship between the groups. Students with MR in special schools have mentioned fewer definitions of a close friend, tended to have fewer friends, and engage in fewer leisure activities or in activities inappropriate to their age group. Some of them felt isolated, rejected or ignored in the classroom or in school, compared with students in the other groups. The teachers estimate that the students with MR in special education schools are more popular at school but lonelier at home. The two sources of information validated one another and add information to the quality of friendships in the groups' studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - According to IDEA and NCLB requirements, students with disabilities are held to the same standards established for nondisabled students. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the impact of a special education inclusion program for middle school students with mild to moderate learning disabilities. Student outcomes were measured based on the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) test scores for reading/language and mathematics. The theoretical foundation for this study was Vygotsky’s social development theory applied to special education inclusion programs to support learning within the general curriculum for students with mild to moderate learning disabilities. An independent samples t test was used to measure the difference in the means of the TCAP scores for 2 cohorts of Grade 6, 7, and 8 students with disabilities (one group taught before the implementation of an inclusion program and one group taught after the implementation of an inclusion program). The findings indicated that inclusion had a significant positive impact on TCAP scores in both reading/language and mathematics. The implications for positive social change generated by this research include a better understanding of the impact of an inclusion program on the TCAP scores of students with mild to moderate learning disabilities at one middle school in Tennessee. Effective IEP decisions have implications for social change because positive educational experiences for middle school students with mild to moderate disabilities increase the likelihood such students will graduate from high school to enter higher education or the work force.

AB  - Schools in Norway are supposed to meet the ideals connected to inclusive education. The most common definition of inclusive education in Norway is multiple-oriented, meaning that inclusive education is a product of a variety of values, processes and experiences. Learning environment is a particularly central element in inclusive education. The article deals with how varying groups of pupils with special educational needs experience their learning environment in school in Norway, compared with other pupils. The experiences of the learning environment are important for well-being in school and to benefit from teaching. Pupils' experiences have not been widely studied as a basis for educational policy and practise. This goes especially for pupils with difficulties and pupils receiving special education. Data were collected by a net-based survey with about 10,000 pupils answering the questionnaire. The results indicate that pupils with difficulties in school and those in special education experience a learning environment of lower quality than other pupils.

AB  - Although educators continue to provide all students access to their grade-level curriculum, students with disabilities are not performing academically in accordance with state standards. The purpose of this sequential transformative mixed methods study was to investigate academic and/or behavioral differences between an inclusion classroom and a regular education classroom. The communities of practice learning theory provided the theoretical foundation for this study. The sequential transformative strategy was used to explore the implementation of an inclusion classroom, which students would be best suited for that type of environment, and the teacher perceptions that exist concerning students' placement in regular education and inclusion classrooms. Participants included 4 teachers and 40 students, all from 2nd grade. Convenience sampling was chosen for sample selection because of the participants' convenient accessibility and proximity to the researcher. T tests and a mixed ANOVA, computed from pre- and post-test data obtained using the Standardized Test for the Assessment of Reading (STAR), were used with the quantitative section of the study. There was a significant difference in STAR reading scores between students in the inclusion and non-inclusion classrooms, as well as between students who receive special education services and those who do not. Typological analyses were used with the qualitative section of the study. Teacher interview participants agreed that inclusion classrooms provide more individualized instruction, thereby increasing student confidence and participation. These findings have implications for positive social change by informing the efforts of school personnel in determining which students benefit from an inclusion classroom and by what means they are ensured success within that inclusive environment.

AB  - Focused on 3,305 students who self-reported frequent bullying victimization, this study compared the use and effectiveness of responses to address bullying victimization among students in special education, as compared with students in general education. Students in special education were less likely to make a joke, but more likely to tell the aggressor how they felt, hit the aggressor, and tell an adult at school and home, according to self-report. Furthermore, students in special education were significantly more likely to report that things got worse after using each response. Implications for educational policy and future research are discussed.

AB  - Research on bullying is an important avenue for understanding the social integration of students in special education. Focused on 3,305 students who self-reported victimization of two to three times per month or more, this study compared the pattern of verbal, relational, and physical bullying among students in general education and special education. Overall, students in special education reported more physical and emotional harm as well as more psychological distress as a result of their victimization. Self-reported rates of verbal and relational victimization were similar, but physical victimization was more often reported among students in special education. In addition, adult teachers and staff were more likely to verbally, relationally, and physically bully students in special education, according to student self-report.

AB  - A total of 86 deaf children aged between 12 and 16 years were recruited from schools for the deaf, specialist units attached to a school, and mainstream schools. Approximately one-third used hearing aids, one-third had received a cochlear implant before 42 months, and one-third had been implanted later. The 3 subgroups were matched for age and nonverbal IQ, and all had an unaided hearing loss of at least 85 dB. Assessments revealed mean reading ages that were several years below chronological age for all 3 groups. However, participants in the hearing aid group performed best. Reading levels were not predicted by age of diagnosis or degree of hearing loss, but there was a relationship between reading level and presence of phonetic errors in spelling. There were also differences in educational setting, with the great majority of children in the hearing aid group in a school for the deaf and relatively more of the children with cochlear implants being educated in a unit or mainstream setting.

AB  - The question of where best to educate students with disabilities to maximize their academic achievement has been discussed and researched for over four decades, with inconsistent and contradictory results. This study focused on the mathematics and reading achievement of middle and high school students with mild disabilities in an urban district in a plains state, as measured by state assessments. The study was comprised of 430 students in the area of mathematics and 449 in the area of reading. The intent of the study was to determine if placement in inclusive settings made scoring proficient in reading and mathematics more likely than placement in non-inclusive settings. The dependent variable was the individual student's academic performance, proficient or not proficient, on state reading and mathematics assessments. The independent variable was the instructional delivery model in which each student was placed respectively for reading and mathematics instruction (general education with no support, general education with support of a special education co-teacher or paraprofessional, separate special education classroom, and separate special education school). Control variables included the student's disability category, race, gender, poverty status, and the school attended by each student. The study employed a Two-Stage Least Squares regression to estimate the odds of students scoring proficient in reading or mathematics based on their instructional delivery model. The first of two main findings was that the instructional delivery model in which a student receives instruction significantly affects performance in mathematics. For each increase in delivery model restrictiveness the odds of scoring proficient in mathematics decreased. The second finding was that the effect of instructional delivery model on reading proficiency was not significant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in developmental gains for three types of various service delivery models among preschoolers with special needs while holding constant age on overall developmental gains, sub-developmental scores (cognition, motor, communication, adaptive, and personal-social areas), and post educational placement. The rationale for this investigation stems from an extensive review of current literature that is inconclusive with regard to the variability of developmental gains across service delivery models. There is definitely a need to determine the beneficial effects of self-contained, community-based, and home-based preschool programs on the developmental growth among preschoolers with disabilities. A nonequivalent pretest and posttest group design was used to conduct the study. Three significance tests were used to determine the effects of service delivery models on total development, subtests of development and post educational placement. They included ANOVA, General Linear Model, and Chi-Square respectively. Approximately 77 preschoolers with disabilities participated in this investigation. The sample represented various developmental delays and socio-economic levels. Student ages ranged from three to five years old. There was a minimum of 24 or more subjects in each group (service delivery model). This study focused on those preschoolers who attended a minimum of 90 instructional days in the school years of 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. The Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI) established a baseline (in months) of each student's developmental level. Upon completion of the school year, the BDI was given again to assess student's developmental gains. No significant differences were found with regard to total developmental changes or subtest-area changes, but a statistical significance difference was found with regard to post educational placement. Those students who initially were placed in school-based (self-contained) and community-based settings not only retained their special education eligibility, but received a segregated school placement in the succeeding year. In addition, ancillary findings yielded significant differences when age, number of days in the instructional program, and weekly instructional hours were analyzed with the three service delivery models. Children in school-based and home-based settings were older than those participants in the community-based model. In addition, school-based subjects had a higher rate of attendance (instructional days) and received more weekly instructional hours than those in the other service delivery models.

AB  - This is the first study to compare the social competence of children with moderate intellectual disability in inclusive versus segregated school settings in the Republic of Ireland. A convenience sample was recruited through two large ID services. The sample comprised 45 children across two groups: Group 1 (n = 20; inclusive school) and Group 2 (n = 25; segregated school). Parents and teachers completed the "Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Adaptive Behaviour Scale--School: 2nd edition". A series of 2 x 2 ANOVAs were carried out on social competence scores using educational placement type (inclusive vs segregated school) and proxy rater (parent vs teacher) as the independent variables. Key findings indicated that children in inclusive schools did not differ significantly from children in segregated schools on the majority of proxy ratings of social competence. This supports the belief that children with intellectual disabilities can function well in different educational settings. Present findings highlight the importance of utilising the functional model of ID when selecting and designing school placements for children with moderate ID. (Contains 2 figures and 3 tables.)

AB  - Although there are important laws on the education of the learning disabled, researchers agree that there is a paucity of studies about inclusionary mathematics in the urban middle schools. The purpose of this researcher is to further that research by investigating the educational outcomes for students with disabilities that are included in urban middle school general education mathematics programs as indicated by standardized assessments and the educational context in which math inclusion students participate. Quantitative research about the data on 89 students with math learning disabilities from four urban middle schools were analyzed in terms of their scores on standardized city and state tests. Through qualitative data involving observations and teacher interviews, findings are reported on the math classroom environments of those students. There were 11 general education and 10 special education teachers who were part of the study. A framework for the qualitative aspect of this research was taken from Mastropieri & Scruggs guidelines effective mainstreaming strategies that promote school success. It was hypothesized that across a 3 year span there would be significant gains in mathematics citywide tests results for the sample students. Schools and scores were compared in terms of inclusive supports. Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare mathematics test scores across the three years of inclusionary participation. Paired samples t-tests comparing one year's scores to the next and analysis of variance to compare the four schools ranked according to the level of inclusive support were used to determine findings. Results showed that there were no significant gains across a 3 year span and the school with the highest number of inclusive supports did not demonstrate significantly higher mathematics tests scores when compared to the other three schools. Implications and recommendations for future research are provided.

AB  - The three articles that comprise this dissertation focus on inclusion—the education of students with disabilities in regular education classrooms alongside nondisabled peers. Using a nationally representative dataset, I explore the multiple defining characteristics of inclusive classrooms, and how these characteristics mediate the impact that inclusion has on reading achievement for nondisabled students in the 3rd grade. In the first article, I provide a comparative analysis of students who are educated in inclusive versus non-inclusive classrooms. Key findings include the fact that students in inclusive classrooms are more likely to have an aide in their classroom, and they are also more likely to have a teacher who consults often with a special education teacher. These data also show that students in inclusive classrooms are more likely to have classmates who are White and have relatively high levels of socioeconomic status, yet they are also more likely to have classmates who are reading below grade level, providing some evidence that inclusive classrooms are often synonymous with “low-track” classes. The second article uses cluster analysis to determine how students with disabilities are distributed in inclusive classrooms. I find that over 60 percent of inclusive classrooms include students with disabilities in proportions that closely mirror their proportions in the overall population of students with disabilities. The remaining 40 percent of the classrooms fall into one of 6 groups, or “clusters,” each with one disability type dominating. In the third and final article, I examine the relationship between inclusion and a nondisabled student's achievement in reading. I find that, controlling for background variables, inclusion makes no difference on a nondisabled student's achievement in reading, with a few exceptions. In particular, I find that for nondisabled students who are educated in classes containing students with autism or emotional disturbance, those who have an aide in their classroom outperform their peers in classes without an aide, as well as students in non-inclusive classrooms. For those who are educated in classes containing students with disabilities related to language and learning, students perform better when their teacher collaborates more frequently with a special education teacher.

AB  - The authors report 1-year outcomes for 11 children (3-7 years) with autism who attended an "Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) classroom" educational intervention in a mainstream school setting. The children learned new skills by the end of 1 year and learned additional skills during a 2nd year. Group analysis of standardized test outcomes (IQ and adaptive behavior) showed moderate to large effect size changes over 1 year, with further changes during a 2nd year. Standardized test outcomes for nine children after 2 years were also analyzed against a comparison group (n = 18) of children with autism receiving "education as usual." These controlled comparisons were associated with statistically significant large effects in favor of the ABA group for adaptive skills. Exploratory analysis also showed that increases in language and learning skills in the ABA class group were generally associated with positive changes in standardized test scores. A comprehensive behavioral intervention model can be successfully implemented in a mainstream school setting. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether Black students with mild disabilities receiving their education in general education settings perform better academically than Black students with mild disabilities receiving their education in resource classroom settings. Sixty-four Black high school students with mild disabilities receiving special education services were assessed using the Grade Level Short Form (Reading sub-test) of the Multilevel Academic Survey Test (MAST). Their reading scores were examined relative to each participant's placement in either included or non-included classrooms. Results revealed statistically significant evidence of difference in reading abilities to indicate that one group outperformed the other group in the inclusive or resource classroom settings. Limitations of the study, implications for both general and special educators, and considerations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Ample empirical research from regular school settings documents reciprocal effects between academic performance and academic self-concept of ability (ASC), supporting what is known as a reciprocal effects model (REM). The present article investigates a REM in the domain of reading performance in a sample of elementary students with special educational needs in learning (SEN-L) who received special educational support in exclusive versus inclusive settings ( N = 446). In exclusive settings, SEN-L students attend special schools and are completely separated from regular students. By contrast, SEN-L students in inclusive settings attend regular schools and are educated in classes with regular students. In both settings, SEN-L students are not graded and taught based on individual learning goals, which may affect reciprocal effects between ASC and reading performance. In addition, given that special education for SEN-L students relies heavily on individual reference standards to evaluate performance, we tested individual performance growth of SEN-L students as a predictor of ASC. Analyses of a longitudinal dataset across 3rd and 4th grade revealed some cross-lagged effects and an effect of performance growth on ASC in exclusive settings in particular. The discussion focuses on the role of individualized instruction, grades, peer groups, and individual versus social reference standards for reciprocal effects between ASC and performance as well as practical implications.

AB  - In response to federal and state mandates, students with disabilities increasingly are being educated in more inclusive settings. Although accountability related to state curriculum standards and standardized test scores is important, graduation rates may be the critical factor in deciding whether current educational policy is resulting in successful outcomes for students. This study examined the records of 67,749 students with mild disabilities in Georgia during a 6-year period to determine the effects of inclusion (i.e., the amount of time spent in general education classrooms) on graduation rates. Results indicated a 62% increase in the percentage rate in inclusion for students with mild disabilities, while graduation rates for students with mild disabilities have remained stable (+0.4%) at less than 30%.

AB  - Dropout rates impacting students with high-incidence disabilities in American schools remain staggering (Bost, 2006; Hehir, 2005). Of this group, students with Emotional Behavioral Disorders (EBD) are at greatest risk. Despite the mandated national propagation of inclusion, students with EBD remain the least included and the least successful when included (Bost). Accordingly, this study investigated the potential significance of inclusive settings and other school-related variables within the context of promoting the graduation potential of students with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) or EBD. This mixed-methods study investigated specified school-related variables as likely dropout predictors, as well as the existence of first-order interactions among some of the variables. In addition, it portrayed the perspectives of students with SLD or EBD on the school-related variables that promote graduation. Accordingly, the sample was limited to students with SLD or EBD who had graduated or were close to graduation. For the quantitative component the numerical data were analyzed using linear and logistic regressions. For the qualitative component guided student interviews were conducted. Both strands were subsequently analyzed using Ridenour and Newman’s (2008) model where the quantitative hypotheses are tested and are later built-upon by the related qualitative meta-themes. Results indicated that a successful academic history, or obtaining passing grades was the only significant predictor of graduation potential when statistically controlling all the other variables. While at a marginal significance, results also yielded that students with SLD or EBD in inclusive settings experienced better academic results and behavioral outcomes than those in self-contained settings. Specifically, students with SLD or EBD in inclusive settings were found to be more likely to obtain passing grades and less likely to be suspended from school. Generally, the meta-themes yielded during the student interviews corroborated these findings as well as provided extensive insights on how students with disabilities view school within the context of promoting graduation. Based on the results yielded, provided the necessary academic accommodations and adaptations are in place, along with an effective behavioral program, inclusive settings can be utilized as drop-out prevention tools in special education.

AB  - This final report discusses the activities and outcomes of a 3-year federally funded project that investigated the effectiveness of a collaborative teaming process to increase the academic achievement and social participation of elementary students with augmentative and alternative (AAC) needs who were members of general education classrooms. The collaborative teaming process provided members of the inclusion support team (general and special education teachers, instructional assistants, parents of the focus students, and speech and language therapists) with an opportunity to share their expertise in developing and implementing effective instructional and support strategies to facilitate the social participation and academic progress of the students. Three inclusion teams then evaluated the collaborative teaming process. Effectiveness of the team-generated support plans for six students, including three with severe disabilities and three who were at risk for academic underachievement or failure, was also evaluated through behavioral observations and team interviews. Direct and collateral outcomes of the project included the following: (1) increased inclusion team members' sense of self-efficacy; (2) increased social and academic participation of the focus students in the general education classroom; and (3) participant satisfaction with the process and results. Three published experimental research papers are attached and include references. (CR)

AB  - This study examined the extent to which the academic achievement of adolescents receiving both foster care and special education services differs from the performance of youths involved in only foster care, special education, or general education. Extant school data were collected on 327 students, ages 13 through 21, who attended school in a large urban school district in Oregon. The study also collected information about students' general foster care experiences, such as length of time in care and type and number of placements. Analyses revealed that foster care youths in special education typically demonstrated lower performance on academic variables in contrast to one or more of the comparison groups. These youths also appeared to experience more restrictive special education placements than youths in special education only. Although foster care or special education status alone appears to place a student at risk of academic difficulties, the negative impact of interfacing with both systems appears multiplicative. Greater attention, commitment, and time must be given to the educational needs of foster care youths with disabilities by both education and child welfare professionals.

AB  - This quasi-experimental study focused on 15 pairs of children with extensive support needs, matched across 12 characteristics based on their first complete Individual Education Program (IEP) in the school district. One child in each pair was included in general education for 80% or more of their day from their first IEP to the most current IEP at the time of the study. The other child in the pair was placed in a separate special education class, and was served there from the first IEP to the last IEP. All children were observed over a typical school day with time-sampling data collected on the types of activities, the contexts, and the types of engagement that occurred. In addition, outcome data from the first IEP to the most current IEP in the district were analyzed across three variables: communication levels, literacy levels, and numeracy levels. Results indicated that students in the general education classrooms had a significant, large effect size as compared with their pairs in separate classrooms on several variables. In addition, students in the general education classrooms demonstrated highly significant levels of progress as compared with the students in separate classrooms. Implications related to placement, disability characteristics, progress, and policy are discussed.

AB  - The reporting of findings from Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an important part of educational monitoring in Germany. However, until now, the subsample of students with special educational needs (SEN) had been too small to single out this group and report findings. In PISA 2012, the sample of 9th grade students in Germany was thus expanded by students with SEN in inclusive settings and students with SEN in an oversample of 49 special schools. This article describes and compares the proficiency of students with SEN in inclusive settings and in special schools. In all 3 PISA domains assessing literacy, reading, mathematics, and science, students with SEN in inclusive settings achieve proficiency Level 2, whereas students with SEN in special schools achieve proficiency Level 1. It turns out that students with SEN have a lower average socioeconomic status than regular students, especially those in special schools. Possible explanations for the higher achievement of students with SEN in inclusive settings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In a survey, 840 parents of children with cognitive deficits who were educated either in special schools or in inclusive classes were asked to assess their children's school experiences. The results showed an overall high degree of satisfaction with the schooling, but there were marked differences among the parents' assessments depending on the degree of learning disabilities and on the type of school. Satisfaction with their children's social experiences and satisfaction with the special education curriculum depend on these two factors. All in all, many parents of children in inclusive classes were satisfied with their children's schooling than those of children in special schools. The analysis of the causes for discontent showed that dissatisfied parents had chosen the type of school under less favourable conditions and a larger part of them are still not convinced of this necessity of additional help. This applied to parents of pupils in inclusive classes as well as to those of pupils in special schools. Furthermore, parents of children with German as a second language showed a higher degree of discontent than others.

AB  - This research study examined the effects of inclusion on the academic achievement of disabled and non disabled students involved in two types of inclusion classrooms, as well as students in a school utilizing a pull out model of instruction. Second, the two inclusion schools were compared to see which model produced greater academic achievement. The inclusion schools were then compared to the pull out school to see if there were differences between the models. Lastly, the factors of gender and ethnicity were analyzed while teacher attitudes and perceptions of inclusion were examined via a survey administered at the beginning and end of the same school year. This study included 54 special education students and 604 general education students enrolled in grade one, two and three. All of the students were enrolled in Title 1 schools on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The Gates MacGinitie Reading Assessment was administered to all students in grades one, two and three. Two different forms of the assessment were administered, one in September and one in April. This assessment tests a variety of reading skills appropriate for each grade level. The Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, Edition Five was administered to grade two students in June of the school year. This nationally normed test is administered throughout the country at various times during the school year. The assessment data in this research found a significant difference in the academic achievement of disabled students and non disabled students. In regards to which model of inclusion affected academic achievement more, the homogeneous inclusion school had a higher level of academic achievement. When all models were examined the results varied based on the assessment that was analyzed. Varying ranges of significant difference were discovered on factors, specifically gender and ethnicity. It was found that females are achieving at a higher rate when compared to the male students. In regards to ethnicity, the results varied based on the particular school. The teacher survey results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The dispersed inclusion school had an overall higher mean score when compared to the homogeneous inclusion school.

AB  - Parents, professionals, and researchers have been concerned about the most appropriate placement for children with mental retardation. To shed light on the efficacy of integration, 36 studies were reviewed on the academic and social attainments of school-age children with mental retardation. Results show that children in general education classes do not attain social acceptance ratings at as high a level as do their typically developing peers. When comparing children with mental retardation in general education and special education classrooms, integrated students perform better than their comparable segregated students on measures of academic achievement and social competence. Other variables are discussed that might affect child outcomes, and related recommendations are given for future research.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether the proportion of time spent in an inclusive educational setting, a process indicator of the quality of schooling for children with autism, improves key outcomes. Methods: Patients were 484 children and youth educated in special education with a primary diagnosis of autism in the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2. These individuals were ages 20 to 23 in 2007. We used propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weights to eliminate the effect of multiple confounders. A causal interpretation of the effect of inclusivity on key educational and functional outcomes still depends on a critical assumption, that inclusivity is not confounded by remaining, omitted confounders. Results: Compared with children with autism who were not educated in an inclusive setting (n = 215), children with autism who spent 75% to 100% of their time in a general education classroom (n = 82) were no more likely to attend college (P = .40), not drop out of high school (P = .24), or have an improved functional cognitive score (P = .99) after controlling for key confounders. Conclusions: We find no systematic indication that the level of inclusivity improves key future outcomes. Research on educational and functional outcomes for children with autism can benefit from data on large samples of children educated in real-world settings, such as the National Longitudinal Transition Study-2, but more nuanced indicators should be developed to measure the quality of special education for children with autism.

AB  - An increasing amount of research attention is being directed toward the educational experiences of students with profound and multiple disabilities. One technique that has allowed a better understanding of alertness and involvement in members of this population is behavior state assessment. In this study, eight matched pairs of school-aged students with profound and multiple disabilities were observed for one full day in either a segregated classroom or an inclusive classroom in Australian schools. Behavior states were systematically observed and recorded, along with several contextual indicators including measures of communicative behaviors, activity, and social grouping. Despite the absence of significant differences in most observed student behavior states between the two settings, the students observed in general classrooms in this investigation were involved in significantly higher levels of communicative interaction than their matched peers in special classrooms. Differences in the frequency of the communicative partners in the two settings were also observed. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of enrollment practices, staff development issues, and the development of inclusive curriculum and instruction. (Contains 9 tables.)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine classroom placement, inclusive versus non-inclusive, relative to the academic performance of students with specific learning disabilities in secondary content area classrooms. Fifty-seven high school students with learning disabilities were assessed using the Grade Level Short Form of the Multilevel Academic Survey Test (MAST). Their reading and math scores were examined relative to each student's grade level, number of general and special education classes attended, and types of placement (i.e., inclusive or non-inclusive setting). The results revealed no statistically significant evidence to indicate that students' academic achievement varied based on inclusive versus non-inclusive placement. The only statistically significant differences observed regarded participants enrolled in a general education literature class compared to those participants placed in a special education setting for literature. Implications for practice, limitations of the study, and considerations for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined students' movement in and out of special education and predictors for later special education placement. The sample ( N = 556) came from a response to intervention (RTI) study, specifically, a cluster-randomized control field trial that undertook the development and study of a hybrid Tier 1 (classroom instruction) and Tier 2 (specific differentiated small group interventions) model in kindergarten during the 2007–2008 school year. On average, from kindergarten to third grade about 13% of the sample was classified for special education services. However, the students accounted for in that 13% varied greatly from year to year as many students exited special education while others entered it. The most movement out of special education occurred in the earlier grades. Specifically, 80% of the students in special education from kindergarten had been declassified from special education by the end of first grade, whereas only 0% and 2% exited special education from first to second grade and second to third grade respectively. Further, the students who exited special education were replaced by a significantly lower group of students from general education. Students with speech impairments, language impairments, specific learning disabilities, and developmental delays accounted for most of the declassification from special education. To determine students' responsiveness to instruction beyond placement in special education, a standard score of 90 on reading subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Achievement Test-III was used as a cut point. In general, students who remained in or entered into special education had greater percentages of scores below 90, while students who remained in general education or exited special education had smaller percentages of scores below 90. Overall, the entire sample scored better on code-focused subtests (i.e., letter word identification and word attack) than on meaning-focused subtests (i.e., picture vocabulary and passage comprehension). Finally, logistic regressions run with Hierarchical Linear Modeling software revealed that no school- or classroom-level variables from the fall of kindergarten were significantly predictive of later placement in special education. Although treatment condition, which was assigned at the school level, was not predictive of later special education, children's performance during the fall of kindergarten on measures of letter naming fluency, picture vocabulary and cognitive processing speed were predictive of later special education placement. Also, being male significantly increased a student's odds of being in special education at the end of first grade, but not at any of the other grades. Further, although being African American never significantly predicted later special education placement, chi-square tests revealed that African Americans were significantly more likely to be placed in special education in first grade, but at no other grades. Recommendations for future research involving special education classification and declassification within RTI studies included using detailed child demographics, programmatic characteristics, well-described instructional practices, and longitudinal information. Implications for practice included: district reporting that demonstrates the movement both in and out of special education; policy requiring states to include separate special education classifications for students with speech impairments and language impairments; early literacy instruction that involves letter naming fluency; intensive vocabulary instruction during the reading acquisition years; and comprehension and meaning-focused interventions beginning by third grade.

AB  - Educational institutions are placing students with disabilities in inclusive programming to meet legislative requirements. School districts have been mandated to develop rigorous programs that can increase the academic achievement of students with disabilities, as well as their participation in general education classrooms. Many school districts, including public school academies (PSAs) have begun to consider more inclusive practices for the students with disabilities. Michigan school systems have begun to review strategies to improve student academic performance and improve test scores. Unfortunately, efforts to restructure the programming for students with disabilities without fully understanding all consequences may not be in the best interest of all students. Michigan utilizes a standardized test called the Michigan Education Assessment Program (MEAP) to assess student's progress. Of the 9,754 students with disabilities who were tested in 2012, 975.4 (10%) students scored in the proficient range (MDE, 2012). Many schools were experiencing difficulties making annual yearly progress because of the student with disabilities subcategory. Consequently, school districts are developing programs that can assist in increasing the academic success of students with disabilities. Due to the continued controversial nature of the need to increase the percentage of students with disabilities into general education settings and improve educational attainment of these students, this study examined differences in results on standardized mathematical assessments between the educational settings of students with disabilities. The population for this study included nine charter (full inclusion) and nine traditional public schools (self-contained) in Michigan that had at least two years of standardized testing data for the students with disabilities subgroup. The findings of the study indicated no statistically significant differences in academic achievement between traditional public schools and charter schools. Based on these findings, it appears that the educational environment of the school (inclusive or self-contained) was not a factor in academic achievement of 7th grade students with disabilities.

AB  - This quantitative study analyzed archival data to determine if there was a significant difference in reading comprehension test scores before and after the implementation of direct instruction. This study also analyzed student records to determine if there were significant differences in the declassification or inclusion of students before and after the implementation of direct instruction. The sample consisted of 362 fourth grade students with moderate learning disabilities, such as learning disabled, speech impaired, and other health impairment, from a suburban-urban low socio-economic school district. A descriptive comparative research design was chosen for its effectiveness in gathering and analyzing data to find the differences between the two groups. An Independent-Samples t-test was used to determine if there was a significant difference in test score means between direct instruction and non-direct instruction. Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit tests were used to determine if there were significant differences in the declassification and inclusion of students between direct instruction and non-direct instruction. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference, p = .03, in the test score means between direct instruction and non-direct instruction. The results also demonstrated a significant difference, p = .04, in the frequencies of students who were declassified before and after the implementation of direct instruction. The same was true for the students who were placed in an inclusive setting, p = .01. Practical implications for this study suggest that Professional Development (PD) of direct instruction is an essential factor to effectively implement it. Effective implementation of direct instruction can yield positive results for students with disabilities.

AB  - Inclusive programs increasingly have become available for students with severe disabilities, enabling them to receive special education services and supports in general education classes alongside their non-disabled peers. Forty students in two groups were assessed across two years of inclusive versus self-contained educational programming, comparing outcomes on measures of child development and social competence with the Scales of Independent Behavior (SIB) and the Assessment of Social Competence (ASC). Participants were assessed on the SIB and ASC, matched into pairs on chronological age and SIB total scores at first testing, and reassessed after two additional years of either inclusive or self-contained schooling. The inclusive student group made statistically significant gains on the developmental measure and realized higher social competence scores in comparison to the self-contained group at follow-up. Examination of gains on these measures irrespective of group affiliation indicated that participants made small, but significant, gains in two of four skill clusters assessed by the SIB and three of eleven dimensions of the ASC These results challenge a common assumption that self-contained settings in comparison to inclusive settings will result in superior gains on students' IEP-related skill domains. They also support previous research showing social competence gains as a function of inclusion. Results are discussed in terms of expected change over time for students with severe disabilities, the implications of variations from the group results that occurred for individual students, and future research needed on the outcomes of quality inclusive schooling for students with severe disabilities.

AB  - This study explores the conditions that limit social participation for children with physical disabilities, and in particular, how school segregation practices affect participation in formal and informal after-school activities. In a sample of 491 children, to varying degrees, a majority of the children were taken out of ordinary classroom education and tutored in smaller groups or with one single teacher or assistant, or attended special schools. Results showed that the more the child was segregated from ordinary classroom education, the lower were his or her chances of seeing friends or participating in after-school formal group activities. In addition to parent's income and educational attainments, various measures of the severity of the child's disability significantly affected social participation. In particular, parental background affected the chances of participation in formal, organised activities. However, these factors alone could not account for the empirically strong association between segregation practices and social participation. While probably not intentional, segregation practices effectively limit or even prevent children with physical disabilities from engaging in a wider social setting. The very same welfare state practices responsible for integrating children maintain institutional arrangements that effectively exclude children with disabilities from participating in mainstream society.

AB  - This study analyzed the effect of school/grade configuration for regular and special education students in K-8 schools and middle schools. The analysis looked at the effect of grade configuration on two outcomes: student achievement and student attendance. The study followed a cohort of fifth graders (regular and special education) through sixth, seventh and eighth grades, in either a K-8 or a middle school. The analysis used multilevel modeling to account for student demographics, prior achievement and school variation in achievement. Many factors including demographic features such as race, free and reduced meals (FARMS), and prior achievement can affect middle grade performance. Because students and schools differ in terms of some of these variables, multilevel evaluation was necessary to partial out their effects to determine the effect of school grade configuration on student outcomes. Results indicated that students performed slightly better academically, as measured by the Maryland State Assessments, in the K-8 schools but only at a statistically significant level for regular education 6th grade math and special education 6th grade reading. Attendance results indicated that students in 6th grade regular and special education performed statistically significantly better in K-8 schools but the magnitude was small. Four major outcomes of this study had implications for policy and practice: (a) The results of this study do not support reconfiguration as a strategy for better outcomes; (b) Student performance in fifth grade was the best predictor of student success in the middle grades; (c) School performance had a significant effect on student performance, regardless of school configuration or placement in regular or special education; (d) These results suggest the importance of including special education students in high-performing schools, where they will have the potential to perform at higher levels.

AB  - <bold>Background and Aims: </bold>High quality student-teacher relationships (STR) are important for children's academic and social development. We explore how individual child language domains (semantics, syntax, pragmatics), teacher years of experience, and classroom placement (general or special education) relate to STR quality for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across the school year.<bold>Methods and Procedures: </bold>191 children with ASD (Mage = 5.6 years) completed a standardized language assessment and their teachers reported on STR quality twice during the school year.<bold>Outcome and Results: </bold>Pragmatics, but not semantics or syntax, had a direct effect on student-teacher closeness. The association between semantics and closeness was moderated by classroom type; for students with low semantics, teacher-reported closeness was lower in general versus special education. Teachers in special versus general education classrooms reported closer relationships. More experienced teachers reported closer and less conflictual relationships. None of the three language domains were associated with student-teacher conflict.<bold>Conclusions and Implications: </bold>Pragmatic and semantic language skills were associated with closer relationships. Language-focused therapies may be effective in carrying over to impact STR quality. Given the stability in relationship quality, targeted interventions should be delivered to teachers at the beginning of the school year to support positive relationship development.

AB  - This article presents the key findings and discusses the implications of a major study that explored the relationship between academic achievement and the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream schools in England. It is based on a statistical analysis of nationally held data on all pupils in England that is collected at the end of each of the 4 key stages, when pupils are aged 7, 11, 14, and 16. The analysis considered the relationship between academic achievement and inclusivity having controlled for a range of other variables. Findings indicate that there is no relationship between academic achievement and inclusion at the local authority (LA) level while there is a small but, for all practical purposes, insubstantial relationship at the school level. In addition, there is also a large degree of variation at the school level, suggesting strongly that there are other factors within a school's make up, rather than its degree of inclusivity, that impact on the average academic achievements of its pupils. The overall conclusion, therefore, is that mainstream schools need not be concerned about the potentially negative impact on the overall academic achievements of their pupils of including pupils with SEN in their schools.

AB  - This paper presents and discusses the key findings from a study funded by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) that explored the relationship between achievement and inclusion in mainstream schools in England. Overall the results indicate that, although there is a small statistical relationship between inclusion and academic achievement, this is unlikely to impact on a school's overall performance. This is partly because of the large degree of variation among schools, suggesting that there are other factors within a school's make up rather than its degree of inclusivity which impact on the average achievements of its pupils. This was confirmed by the findings from a number of case study visits. The overall conclusion from the study is that mainstream schools need not be concerned about the potentially negative impact on the overall academic achievements of their pupils through including pupils with special educational needs (SEN) in their schools.

AB  - Explored the links between the development of language and the development of social cognition. Measures of language, phonological short-term memory, social cognition, and social competence of 2 groups of children with specific language impairment (SLI), 1 group attending a special school (mean age 132.5 mo), the other attending integrated educational placements (mean age 129.3 mo), were compared with those of chronological and language (mean age 103.75 mo) age-matched normally developing peers (8 Ss in each group). Significant differences between the scores of normally developing children and the scores of the group of children with SLI who attended the special school were found for social cognition and ratings of social competence. Children with SLI from integrated placements did not differ significantly from other groups on these measures. Assessments of language development and phonological short-term memory were not related to social cognition and social competence. Models of the possible relationship between social cognition and language development in children with SLI are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aims of this study were to help educators and clinicians better identify and understand the different participation levels of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in different classroom settings. This study established the psychometric integrity of the Chinese version of the Participation and Environment Measure – Children and Youth (CPEM-CY), compared the participation levels of children with ASDs in inclusive versus specialized settings across different contexts (at home, at school, and in the community), and explored the relationships between the participation levels of those children in inclusive settings and the amount of weekly school time they spend in resource rooms. The CPEM-CY was supported as a reliable and valid measure for use in Taiwanese culture. Additionally, studies reviewed for this work offered extensive knowledge about participation patterns and environmental factors influencing participation at home, at school, and in the community. Such information aids occupational therapists’ clinical practice, as well as future research and decision-making among health care providers and policymakers. In the main exploratory portion of this study, the findings indicate that “children with ASDs in inclusive versus specialized settings” is the predictor that contributes to community participation involvement but not home and school participation levels. Additionally, no statistically significant relationship was found between the amount of time these children spend in resource rooms and participation frequency and participation involvement at home, at school, and in the community. Understanding the participation levels of children with ASDs in inclusive versus specialized settings can benefit children, parents, occupational therapists, educators, and clinicians. This study provides Taiwanese educators and professionals with a comprehensive way to assess the participation levels of children with ASDs. It also enables international researchers to validate the instrument in their own areas of research interests.

AB  - The inclusion of students with disabilities in large scale assessment and accountability programs has provided new opportunities to examine the impact of special education services on student achievement. Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin (1998, 2002) evaluated the effectiveness of special education programs by examining students' gains on a large-scale assessment of student achievement in Texas as they entered and exited special education programs. They found that special education placement resulted in an overall increase in the achievement scores of students with disabilities. The current study aimed to replicate and extend Hanushek et al.'s research using scores from the End-of-Grade Tests of Reading Comprehension and Mathematics for 396,828 students with and without disabilities who participated in special and/or general education programs over 5 academic years in the state of North Carolina. Results of multiple regression analyses revealed support for the effectiveness of special education programs. After controlling for school characteristics, cohort, regression to the mean, and accommodations use, entry into special education programs remained a significant predictor of students' gain scores on large-scale assessments of reading and mathematics. Students with disabilities made significantly larger gains when enrolled in special education programs than when enrolled in general education programs, and gains were found for most of the subgroups of special education students examined in the study. A discussion of the implications for practice, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - This dissertation highlights a conceptual framework for specialized Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) schools and the college readiness of Inclusive STEM High School graduates in comparison to traditional high school graduates. In reviewing the literature, I found the current perception for specialized STEM schools can be described as unique environments including advanced curriculum, expert teachers, and opportunities for internships and immersion. Finding from the studies exploring college and career readiness of students attending these schools revealed students from specialized STEM schools are performing slightly better on high-stake mathematics and science tests in comparison with students in traditional schools. Studies also showed students from specialized STEM schools are more interested in STEM, more willing to attend classes, more likely to pass state tests, and more likely to earn college degrees. After synthesizing the literature, I created a conceptual framework of effective learning environments for specialized STEM schools using an ecology metaphor. In answering the research questions related to success of students attending either T-STEM or traditional schools, I concluded success on reading, mathematics, science high-stake tests for students does not differ by school type. However, student demographic variables (i.e., gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and special education status) may influence success of students attending T-STEM schools. For example, results revealed statistical significance between male, Hispanic, White, and economically disadvantaged students from T-STEM and traditional schools on reading, mathematics, and science scores. In answering the research question related to success of T-STEM in comparison with traditional schools, I found no statistical significance in measures of schools' success. However, regardless of school type, female students performed better on reading scores whereas male students performed better on mathematics and science scores. In addition, White and Asian students outperformed all other ethnic groups on performance measures. Also, economically disadvantaged students and students in special education program were outperformed by students not identified as disadvantaged or learning disabled. On school level indicators, regardless of school type, dropout rate negatively associated with students' reading, mathematics, and science scores. In addition, percentage of students taking AP/IB end of course exam had a positive association with reading, mathematics, and science scores. Finally, percentage of students taking SAT/ACT also demonstrated a positive association with reading and mathematics scores, but not science scores. In conclusion, specialized STEM schools can be the solution to the problem of shortages in the STEM workforce; however, there still work remains.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) Communication Arts scaled scores of non-disabled students and students with specific learning disabilities (SLD). The study also compared the MAP communication arts scaled scores of students with specific learning disabilities based on the student's special education placement. The population of this study consists of students that were in 3 rd grade and 7th grade during the 1999–2000 school year in school districts throughout Missouri. The sample was taken from a school district located in the Southeast section of Missouri. The one-way ANOVA procedure was utilized to determine if there were significant differences in the different treatments, special education placements, and an independent t-test was used to compare the MAP scores based on the existence and non-existence of a SLD. The findings indicate there were significant differences between groups based upon the amount of time the students with SLD spent in the special education classroom. There were also significant differences between the means of the two groups: those students with SLD and non-disabled students. These findings support the previous research that students that spend more time in the general education setting do better on state and district assessments.

AB  - Despite the trend toward inclusive education for all students, there is little research that focuses on the academic achievement of students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) and other health impairments (OHI) in inclusive classrooms. The purpose of this nonexperimental quantitative study was to analyze and compare the academic achievement of middle school students with SLD or OHI in inclusive coteaching classrooms and in resource classrooms to determine in which setting students with SLD or OHI demonstrate higher achievement on state standards in reading and math. Following a constructivist theory frame of reference, the results of this study will enable educators to make placement decisions that increase the academic achievement of students with SLD and OHI. Archival data from the state test in reading and math, including criterion-referenced and norm-referenced scores, and curriculum based measurements (CBM) in reading were analyzed using repeated measures t tests. Analysis revealed increased achievement on criterion-referenced and norm-referenced tests in reading and math when instruction was provided in an inclusive cotaught classroom. CBM reading probes were compared for growth over time in reading, but no significant improvement was noted on CBM. This study will provide school districts with empirical evidence of increased academic achievement in inclusive classrooms with coteaching, thereby supporting the placement of students with SLD and OHI in general education classrooms instead of resource classrooms. The broad social change implication will be the consideration of the general education classroom as the least restrictive environment (LRE). Instead of discussions about placement, teams will discuss appropriate supports for the student's success in the general education classroom.

AB  - We examined instructional processes in classrooms where students with and without disabilities received mathematics instruction to understand the relationship among key instructional process variables and achievement as measured by interim and end-of-year summative assessments. Teachers (N = 78) completed instructional logs daily and administered easyCBM probes quarterly to 162 students with disabilities and 165 students without disabilities. Examination of instructional data indicated both groups of students had nearly equal opportunities to learn (OTLs) the same mathematics content, yet there were significant differences in these students' mathematics achievement on interim and summative tests. Special education status and instructional practices were found to be significant predictors of achievement growth. Furthermore, grade level and special education status, along with OTL scores, accounted for significant variance in end-of-year mathematics scores. Discussion of results focuses on instructional practice implications and the role these practices play in achievement gaps.

AB  - Current literature related to inclusion indicates that coteaching is beneficial for students in special education in the area of personal development; however, the problem is the relationship between coteaching and academic achievement is still unclear. The purpose of this quantitative study was to compare two instructional methods-coteaching and small group instruction-and then determine if one method was more effective for improving academic achievement. A pre-experimental static group comparison with a post-test design was the research model for this study. Data analysis performed utilized an independent-measures t test. Vygotsky's social learning theory was the theoretical foundation for this investigation. Data for this study came from the End of the Course Test scores of students in special education instructed in either a coteaching classroom or a small group classroom. Results of this study revealed that coteaching was more effective than small group classrooms for increasing academic achievement for students with disabilities. If the academic achievement level of students in special education can be raised, then, they will be encouraged to go on to technical schools or four-year colleges, and prepare them for a career. These students will be contributing to society by holding jobs, paying taxes, buying houses and some may even own businesses and employ other people. They will become productive and successful citizens. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study evaluated the skills of mentally retarded children in recognizing and drawing emotional facial expressions. The study group was made up of 38 mentally retarded students, including 12 girls and 26 boys, who were in three different educational settings: integrated education (mainstreaming program), attending a special lower class, and at a special training school. This research was conducted according to the survey model, and it was found that there was no significant difference between boys and girls in the skills of recognizing and drawing emotional facial expressions p < 0.05. It was also found that the children in integrated education were more successful in recognizing and drawing emotional facial expressions than were the other two groups.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of learning disabilities (LD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), and comorbid disorders among a sample of secondary school general and special education students. The sample included students who were identified in primary school as at risk (i.e., high, moderate, low) for developing EBD (n = 66), and a group of not at risk peers (n = 99). The study also investigated differences among these students on school variables of achievement, ability, adaptive functioning, and academic competence. Differences in comorbidity rates and areas of dimensionality (i.e., degree of overlapping symptoms) were determined. Some students were in the general education program ( n = 137), and some were receiving special education services ( n = 28). Students were assessed on measures of ability, achievement, and behavior. They were then classified in groups based on researcher-developed criteria for LD, ADHD, and EBD. Additionally, differences in ability, achievement, and behavior were analyzed based on gender, educational placement, behavioral type, and risk status. Five models of LD identification were used to classify students as LD. Prevalence rates based on these identification models varied considerably. Students were then classified into a No Disability group, a Single Disability group, and a Multiple Disability group per model. Differences among these three groups were found to vary considerably across the five models on variables of Achievement, Ability, Adaptive Functioning, and Academic Competence. Comparisons revealed variations in differences among students identified as at high risk, moderate risk, low risk, or not at risk status for the development of EBD on variables of Achievement, Ability, and Academic Competence, depending on the LD classification model. However, no significant differences were found among the risk groups on Adaptive Functioning.

AB  - This article describes a preliminary study investigating whether a specific awareness and training for six teacher-paraprofessional teams would have an effect on the inclusion of six students with mild to severe disabilities in elementary general education environments. An experimental design employing a pretest-posttest control group with matched subjects was used to evaluate the effectiveness of training that emphasized the continuous improvement components of teamwork, goal setting, and data collection. Data focusing on student interaction and engagement were collected using MS-CISSAR. Results indicated an increase in teacher interaction and a decrease in paraprofessional interaction with special education students after the training component. Engaged behavior was not found to change noticeably for this group of students. Individual student strategies and benefits are also reported. The article includes a discussion of training formal, key elements, and their relationship to long-term systems change.

AB  - Background: While an extensive body of research has examined the outcomes of inclusion for pupils with special needs, in particular learning disabilities, its effects on the development of children with intellectual disabilities (ID) have been less explored. As inclusive practices tend to be more common for this group of children, it is important to acquire more knowledge on this issue. Methods: A comparative study with an experimental group of 34 children with ID fully included in general education classrooms with support, and a control group of 34 comparable children in special schools has been conducted. The progress accomplished by these two groups in their academic achievement and adaptive behaviour has been compared over two school years. Results: Included children made slightly more progress in literacy skills than children attending special schools. No differences were found between the progress of the two groups in mathematics and adaptive behaviour. Conclusions: Inclusive education is an appropriate educational option for primary pupils with ID who require extensive support in school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The purpose of the proposed quasi-experimental quantitative study was to determine if students who were taught in the inclusive setting yielded higher standardized test scores compared to students who were taught in the resource setting. The researcher analyzed the standardized test scores, in the areas of Language Arts, Reading, and Mathematics of middle school special education students with Specific Learning Disabilities, Emotional Behavior Disorders, and Mild Intellectual Disabilities in the inclusive and resource settings to discover which group of students yielded higher percentage gains. The achievement test scores of the students were measured using data from the state of Georgia's Criterion Referenced Competency Test (CRCT). The population of the study was special education students classified as having a Specific Learning Disability, Emotional Behavior Disorder, or Mild Intellectual Disability that attended middle school in Atlanta Public Schools. The results of this study confirmed previous evidence that inclusion appeared to be more effective for students with various types of disabilities than the resource setting. Students who were assigned to the inclusion setting did significantly better than students who were assigned to the resource settings in the three academic subjects (Math, Language Arts, and Reading) examined in the study. ANOVA results indicated that the difference in CRCT Mathematics raw scores due to class setting was statistically significant, having a p-value of .01, thus rejecting the null hypothesis. Language Arts results indicated a significant difference as well with a very large effect size of partial eta2 =.17 and a p-value of .002. Although there was a statistically significant difference in Reading due to class setting, p=.005, there was also a statistically significant difference due to disability type. Specifically, students diagnosed with Emotional Behavior Disorders were significantly better readers than students with Specific Learning Disabilities or Mild Intellectual Disorders. In order to obtain accurate study results and prohibit a large number of limitations, future studies should include special instructions the students may have been given, as well as, the skill level of participants. The knowledge gained about this phenomenon led to a better understanding of the appropriate classroom setting for special education students.

AB  - Using a second cohort of Australian school students, this study repeated the propensity score analysis reported by Dempsey, Valentine, and Colyvas (2016) that found that 2 years after receiving special education support, a group of infant grade students performed significantly less well in academic and social skills in comparison to matched groups of students who did not receive support. Using Longitudinal Study of Australian Children data, the present study found that the second cohort of students with additional needs also performed less well than matched groups of peers and that these results also held true for the specific subgroup of these children with learning disability/learning problems. The ramifications of these results to the delivery of special education in Australia are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990, autism was recognized as a distinct special education category. Subsequently, there has been a steady increase in the number of students qualified in the schools to receive special education services under this category. There are a number of questions as to the types of services that students classified under autism have been receiving and to the amount of services required in order to meet their educational needs. Given how critical it is to provide effective intensive interventions to students with autism spectrum disorder, research is warranted to examine current educational practices as they pertain to this student population. Data from 143 students (114 males and 29 females) receiving special education services under the classification of autism were analyzed. The students were enrolled in a large urban/suburban school district in Utah. The data were gathered on-site from 30 elementary schools, 12 middle schools, 4 high schools, and 2 special schools. An examination of four age groups (i.e., 6 to 8 years, 9 to 11 years, 12 to 14 years, and 15 to 17.11 years) was conducted to determine what differences may exist across measures of IQ, academic achievement, language, adaptive functioning, social functioning, and behavioral functioning. A comparison of the four age groups indicated that although language deficits persisted in the older students, they received fewer language services. Differences were also found among the age groups in terms of increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, and aggression. Scores from parent ratings of these symptoms increased in a linear fashion from the younger age groups to the older age groups. Behaviors of depression, anxiety, and hyperactivity were found to be negatively correlated with special education and related services, suggesting that students with higher levels of the above-mentioned behaviors receive less special education services. The relationship among relevant psychological factors, the type and amount of special education services, and standardized measures at the state and national level were also analyzed. This study highlights the fact that there is a continued need to better match the type and amount of educational services to the needs of students who receive services under the educational classification of autism.

AB  - Background Studies from the UK have shown that children with Down syndrome acquire more academic skills in regular education. Does this likewise hold true for the Dutch situation, even after the effect of selective placement has been taken into account? Method In 2006, an extensive questionnaire was sent to 160 parents of (specially and regularly placed) children with Down syndrome (born 19932000) in primary education in the Netherlands with a response rate of 76%. Questions were related to the child's school history, academic and non-academic skills, intelligence quotient, parental educational level, the extent to which parents worked on academics with their child at home, and the amount of academic instructional time at school. Academic skills were predicted with the other variables as independents. Results For the children in regular schools much more time proved to be spent on academics. Academic performance appeared to be predicted reasonably well on the basis of age, non-academic skills, parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home on academics. However, more variance could be predicted when the total amount of years that the child spent in regular education was added, especially regarding reading and to a lesser extent regarding writing and math. In addition, we could prove that this finding could not be accounted for by endogenity. Conclusion Regularly placed children with Down syndrome learn more academics. However, this is not a straight consequence of inclusive placement and age alone, but is also determined by factors such as cognitive functioning, non-academic skills, parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home on academics. Nevertheless, it could be proven that the more advanced academic skills of the regularly placed children are not only due to selective placement. The positive effect of regular school on academics appeared to be most pronounced for reading skills.

AB  - This dissertation examined the impact of inclusion on the academic achievement outcome of high school special education students as measured by English 1, biology, and algebra 1 as a function of gender, ethnicity, and years of inclusion. The study also examined the generalizations with confidence that could be made about the use of inclusion methodology in high schools within an urban North Carolina school district as measured by end-of-course test scale scores. Data from three traditional high schools within the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School District were used in this study. High school special education students lagged behind several other subgroups on end-of-course tests proficiency. A quantitative study was conducted. End-of-course test data were collected from 2002-2005 for resource school years and from 2006-2009 for inclusion school years. The mean end-of-course test scale scores for special education students who experienced inclusion teaching methodology and those students who experienced resource-only teaching methodology were examined over a 6-year period of time. An analysis of variance found statistically significant differences between the three schools. The use of 95% confidence intervals helped to make inferences about mean scale scores from a sample statistic toward a population parameter. English 1 special education students did not benefit from inclusion and the years in the inclusion program did not impact students’ academic achievement. Male and female students produced their highest percent proficient during resource years. Both Black and White English 1 students also produced their highest percent proficient during resource years. Biology special education students showed increases in percent proficient during inclusion years. They experienced a pattern of positive gaps when the years in the inclusion program were examined. Male and female biology students benefitted academically from inclusion. Both Black and White biology students showed academic gains during the years of inclusive practices. Algebra 1 special education students in general showed positive gaps in academic proficiency when they experienced inclusion. The years in the inclusion program did not positively impact academic gains for algebra 1 students. Male and female special education students benefitted academically from inclusive algebra 1. Black algebra 1 students showed trends of positive gaps in academic proficiency during inclusion years, but White students did not. The other minorities (Asian, Hispanic, Multi-racial, and Native Americans) did not produce sufficient data in order to see trends. Findings of this study are encouraging for the use of inclusion teaching methodology to increase academic achievement outcomes in some subject areas for high school special education students within an urban North Carolina school district.

AB  - The purpose of this non-experimental, quantitative research study was to examine if a predictive relationship existed between general educators' perceived self-efficacy, attitudes toward inclusion, and the reading achievement of special needs students in an urban school district in the Midwestern United States. A convenience sample of 65 middle school reading teachers participated in the study. The theory of planned behavior, self-efficacy theory, and social cognitive theory provided a theoretical understanding of how inclusion affects the attitude and behaviors of teachers. Attitudes and beliefs affect behavior by determining what a middle school teacher does and does not do, thereby affecting what the student with a disability receives in the classroom. A simple linear regression was used to test the hypotheses according to scores generated from the Teachers' Sense of Efficacy Scale (TSES) short form and the Scale of Teachers' Attitude Toward Inclusive Classrooms (STATIC). The results of both simple linear regression analyses determined that neither the TSES nor the STATIC were found to be significant predictors of the change in Ohio Academic Achievement (OAA) reading test scores during the 2012-2013 school years. The results of this study added to the knowledge base of the field by examining the predictive relationship between teacher perceptions of their self-efficacy, attitudes, and regarding inclusion and the reading achievement of special education students that have been included in a general education classroom for reading instruction.

AB  - A longitudinal study was made of 84 children attending schools for the deaf, and 22 children with marked auditory impairments who were attending ordinary schools. It was attempted to exploit all available means in the application of modem audiological principles to their educational treatment, A special study was also made of factors contributing to intelligible speech reception and the Implications of this were related to the provision of extensive auditory experience for deaf children. After reviewing pertinent literature, pilot studies were made regarding the use of hearing aids in schools for the deaf and in ordinary schools. These revealed serious deficiencies in the extent to which auditory experience was being provided. It has been possible to make practical suggestions to alleviate some of these problems as a result of this research. Some of the possibilities and present limitations to the integration of acoustically handicapped children into a normally hearing environment were investigated and am discussed. Two tests of speech production and 2 of speech reception were constructed but not standardized, for use with profoundly and sub-totally deaf children and with very young deaf children. Experiments into the subject of intelligible speech reception suggested that gradations are likely in the ability of children whose hearing losses exceed 100 decibels, to discriminate between pairs of vowels. Sonagraph recordings were used to illustrate and confirm several findings in the intelligibility study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the affect of time spent in special education on the rate of progress for students in Mississippi with special education rulings of Specific Learning Disabilities. Socioeconomic status, race, and the school's percentage of disproportionate eligibility for special education services of minority students were examined for predictive effect. The results indicate that students with special education rulings served in special education classrooms for less than 21% of the day and students served in a special education classroom for more than 21% but less than 69% showed a greater rate of progress than students with special education rulings receiving no instruction in a special education classroom. The rate of progress was based on a comparison of scores collected from three administrations of the Mississippi Curriculum Practice test. However, even with a higher rate of progress the students with special education rulings were not performing at the same rate as the students in general education. The school's percentage of disproportional identification of minority students for special education services and socioeconomic status were identified as predictors of a greater rate of progress. The findings supported the need for consistent, appropriate inclusion practices, strategic staff development, and more established reliability for the testing instruments.

AB  - Since the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and subsequent modifications (Public Law 108-446, 2004), millions of children have been enrolled in early special education programs as three and four year olds. Yet there continues to be a lack of empirical outcome studies of the outcomes for children who began their career in special education at such a young age. Comparisons with children who entered special education after preschool (kindergarten or first grade) are virtually non-existent. It is also acknowledged within the special education system that children experience many changes in services as they move through the system. The data for this dissertation came from the Miami School Readiness Project [MSRP] a longitudinal, collaborative project designed to improve the quality of child care in the county. Data available included assessment information from preschool special education programs, subsidized child care programs, and follow-up data from public elementary school in an urban, ethnically diverse environment. Children enrolled in public school pre-kindergarten programs (n = 359), community child care (n = 284), and early childhood special education services (n = 695) were assessed for overall development and socio-emotional protective factors in the fall and late spring of their pre-kindergarten year and then followed for several years in early elementary school. Children were assessed in the fall and spring of their pre-kindergarten year using the LAP-D (Nehring, Nehring, Bruni, & Randolph, 1992) or ELAP (Glover, Preminger, & Sanford, 2002), and the DECA (LeBuffe & Naglieri, 1999). Children with autism and developmental delays had the lowest developmental scores on average and showed the slowest rate of development in pre-kindergarten. There was significant movement of children both in and out of special education services and change from one primary exceptionality classification to another. Transitions out of special education in early elementary school, as well as changes in primary exceptionality classification were significantly related to pre-kindergarten assessment information. Children who left special education prior to second grade had lower scores on the cognitive and language portions of the LAP-D, and fewer behavior problems. Children with speech impairments often only spent one year receiving special education services, while children with autism, developmental delays, or emotional disturbances were likely to continue to receive special education services for all four years of the study. Children who were enrolled in pre-kindergarten special education had significantly higher grades and literacy skills as measured by kindergarten readiness tests, and were less likely to be retained in-grade in kindergarten or first grade than their peers who did not enroll in special education until early elementary school. Generally, even children with severe disabilities showed positive gains in all areas over their pre-kindergarten year, and children appeared to benefit from pre-kindergarten special education. These children are being assigned fairly good grades and, as a group, just below average scores on school readiness assessments and standardized tests. It appears that most children in this jurisdiction with developmental disabilities are being identified, referred, and enrolled in special education services prior to elementary school.

AB  - The number skills of groups of 7- to 9-year-old children with specific language impairment (SLI) attending mainstream or special schools were compared with an age and nonverbal reasoning matched group (age control [AC]) and with a younger group matched on oral language comprehension. The SLI groups performed below the AC group on every skill. They also showed lower working memory functioning and had received lower levels of instruction. Nonverbal reasoning, working memory functioning, language comprehension, and instruction accounted for individual variation in number skills to differing extents depending on the skill. These factors did not explain the differences between SLI and AC groups on most skills. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to assess the quality of life (QOL) of children with intellectual disability (ID) aged from 5 to 11 years and to examine its relationship with their schooling context. Methods: Children's QOL was measured using a generic instrument, the abbreviated form of the Multidimensional Student's Life Satisfaction Scale translated and adapted for children as young as 5 years old and children with ID. This instrument measures children's overall QOL as well as their life satisfaction in specific domains (family, school, friends, living environment and self). QOL was self-reported by 354 children aged from 5 to 11 years (average age = 8.20, SD=1.732). Of these, 66 children with mild/moderate ID attended a regular school in an inclusive classroom (n = 41, average age = 9.24, SD=1.091) or a specialized institution (n = 25, average age = 9.37, SD = 1,34) and 288 children without disability attended the French equivalents of Kindergarten to Grade 6 (average age = 7.94, SD = 1.73). In addition, questionnaires for parents and teachers/educators allowed us to collect sociodemographic data and information about children's education. Results: Results show that children with ID report high levels of QOL. They are satisfied with the school, their friends and their life in general. However, their QOL appears impaired compared to their peers without disability, and especially for children enrolled in an inclusive classroom. The responses of these children point out variations between the establishment of some educational measures to compensate for their disabilities and their needs. Impairments and the variables linked to schooling context (educational care, schooling duration, etc.) accounted for most of the variation in the QOL of these children. Conclusion: These findings highlight the need to considerer children with ID above all like children having the same rights as others, to ensure their full participation in society. With a view to providing all children the best possible education, these results suggest to better adapt the aid measures introduced to children of inclusive classroom to encourage their participation in the community life of the school in order to promote their QOL and their educational inclusion and social integration.

Parmi eux, 66 enfants présentent une DI légère à moyenne (41 sont scolarisés en classe d’inclusion scolaire et 25 enfants sont accueillis en institutions spécialisées) et 288 élèves ne présentent aucun handicap et sont scolarisés en milieu ordinaire de la grande section de maternelle au cours moyen 2eannée. Résultats: Les réponses des élèves scolarisés en classe d’inclusion scolaire soulignent que certains dispositifs visant à compenser leur handicap peuvent être source d’insatisfaction. Conclusion: Ces constats incitent à reconsidérer les interventions en direction de ces jeunes dans le but de promouvoir leur QDV et de mieux répondre à leurs besoins.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between hours in general education and achievement in reading and mathematics for students with disabilities. The study population included more than 1,300 students between the ages of 6 and 9 years old within 180 school districts. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was utilized with the Pre-Elementary Education Longitudinal Study (PEELS) data set (Institute of Education Sciences). The relationship between hours in general education and achievement in reading and mathematics was explored while accounting for student- and district-level factors. Results suggest a strong positive relationship between the number of hours students spent in general education and achievement in mathematics and reading. Implications for policy and practice in special education are presented and discussed.

AB  - This study analyzes the very complex issues of people, especially children, with disabilities and their education. Children with disabilities make up about one third of the children outside school, generally in the world. The diachrony and the synchrony of the education of people with disabilities represent a challenge for society and school. The vision about these people (expressed in terminology and definitions), the way of identification, assessment and orientation, the institutions and mechanisms that intervene here, the general, political, economic and cultural aspects and priorities of a certain society, the dominant values in the education system, etc. - are a few of the elements that differentiate the access and school participation of these people - from one country to another. The educational inclusion and integration of children and the special educational needs (SEN) are one of the important objectives of Romanian education. The school institution as a whole must extend its educational aims in order to orientate towards the great diversity of children. It is necessary that education, in its capacity as a service provider, should adapt to the needs of the children, and not vice versa. The ultimate goal is to ensure that all children have access to education within the community, education that is appropriate, relevant and effective.

AB  - Inclusion of special education students in general education class is a controversial issue for educators. Inclusion is not a new idea. Over the past four decades, many parents and professionals have proposed that students with disabilities should have the opportunity to attend school with their non-disabled peers. This study includes a stratified random sample of the 555 Michigan K–12 school districts. District contracts and special education data from a total of 120 school districts are reviewed. The total number of references to the inclusion of special education students in general education within contracts are compared to the total percentage of time special education students are actually included in general education within each district. The study was based on the December 1, 1999 Count. This study suggests that some of the language in teacher contracts dealing with inclusion of special education students in general education may negatively affect the inclusion of special education students, regardless of the nature of their disability. The language in teacher contracts provides a window into the individual districts studied and public education in Michigan as a whole as it relates to the inclusion of special education students in general education. Social constructivist theory explains the teacher contract language dealing with inclusion of special education students, as a response to situations involving inclusion, which have already occurred in a district or in preparation for the inclusion of special education students. This study provides insight into myths about inclusion and teacher contracts. The hypothesis was challenged and the results in turn demonstrate that teacher contract language does not seem to negatively correlate with the inclusion of special education students. In fact it may actually assist in working out the concerns general educators have about inclusion.

AB  - Public schools are required by law to implement inclusionary practices for children with disabilities in order for them to be educated within their least restrictive environment. To accommodate the individual needs of students, many schools have embraced the co-teaching model. Co-teaching allows for special education services to be provided within a mainstream setting where instruction is delivered through collaboration between a general education and a special education teacher. The current study examined the impact on student academic performance as measured by Student Growth Percentiles (SGPs) and teacher collaboration within co-teaching classes when provided with administrator support, logistical needs, and on-going professional development. Results indicated that the difference between pre-test and post-test analyses of SGPs were significantly higher for the co-teaching classes that received the intervention. However, no significant differences existed between teacher collaboration survey results due to high levels of teacher collaboration that were obtained during the baseline measure. The implications for this study are for administrators and school districts to increase the effectiveness of co-teaching classrooms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This disability category study was created to examine the relationship between the effects of inclusion with co-teaching methodologies on mathematics and language arts scores recorded from TCAP scores for 7 th grade students who were found eligible for Special Education as having either a Specific Learning Disability or an Intellectual Disability. This study which reports on the effects of the inclusion classroom environment used a mixed design to examine students' TCAP mathematics and language arts scores of those students who are enrolled in inclusion and non-inclusion classrooms during the 2010-2011 academic school year. The sample consisted of approximately 134 students who were in the 7th grade middle schools during the spring 2011 testing term. The data were obtained from the Office of Research and Evaluation from a large urban school district in West Tennessee. Results from the Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) and Independent t-tests revealed that students classified with Specific Learning Disabilities and Intellectual Disabilities enrolled in an inclusion class do score higher on the state TCAP test for mathematics and language arts. However, there was no statistical difference in the scoring for those same students enrolled in inclusion versus noninclusion classroom methodology of instruction. Lastly, this study found there was no statistical significant difference between the mathematics and language arts TCAP state assessment scores for students with Specific Learning Disability and those with an Intellectual Disability who attended inclusion classrooms.

AB  - In this quantitative, archival study, academic achievement and self-concept scores were compared for middle-school students with EBD based on whether the students had been placed into a self-contained learning environment (SCLE) or a mainstreamed least restrictive environment (MLRE). Academic achievement scores and self-concept scores for 2007 were compared between the two groups (n = 70 for each group), with 2005 scores used as a baseline. The findings of the study demonstrated that when students with EBDs are given an opportunity with highly skilled professional staff members trained in both mental health therapy and special education, improvements are possible. In addition, this study enhanced both the broken-glass and Social, Academic, and Cognitive (SAC) theories by demonstrating the potential of integrating academic skills with emotional and behavioral support. Additional research is needed to investigate more intensive and innovative strategies designed to help students with EBDs succeed academically and socially.

AB  - Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) perform poorly both academically and behaviorally, and this performance tends not to improve over time. There is a need to understand the effect of learning environments on the academic achievement and self-concept of this population. In this quantitative, archival study, academic achievement and self-concept scores were compared for middle-school students with EBD based on whether the students had been placed into a self-contained learning environment (SCLE) or a mainstreamed least restrictive environment (MLRE). Archived scores for academic achievement and self-concept were evaluated for students in an urban school district in South Carolina with highly qualified special-education staff members. Academic achievement scores and self-concept scores for 2007 were compared between the two groups (n = 70 for each group), with 2005 scores used as a baseline. Composite academic achievement scores, as measured with the Measure of Academic Progress, were significantly higher in 2007 for MLRE students than for SCLE students, t(138) = 2.65, p = .009, although between-group differences were not significant at baseline. Academic scores improved from baseline to 2007 for the MLRE group, t(69) = 13.68, p < .001, and the SCLE group, t(69) = 8.16, p < .001. There were no significant between-group differences in self-concept scores for 2007. Self-concept scores, as measured with the Piers-Harris 2, improved from baseline to 2007 for the MLRE group, t(69) = 7.61, p < .001, and the SCLE group, t(69) =7.53, p < .001. Split-plot analyses of variance showed no significant Year x Group interaction effects. The findings of the study demonstrated that when students with EBDs are given an opportunity with highly skilled professional staff members trained in both mental health counseling and special education, improvements are possible. The findings enhanced the broken-glass theory by demonstrating the potential of integrating academic skills with emotional and behavioral support. Additional research is needed to investigate more intensive and innovative strategies designed to help students with EBDs succeed academically and socially. Curriculum-based measurements should be investigated for this population to enhance and integrate academic, emotional, and behavioral skills within the context of highly expert learning environments.

AB  - The project reported here was designed to explore the cognitive style used by pupils with dyslexia when answering a range of mathematical questions. The research involved 132 pupils aged between 9 and 13 years, including 66 pupils in mainstream and 66 pupils in specialist schools, in three countries in Europe. Detailed studies of the methods used by pupils attempting the given questions on a test of cognitive style suggested that they fell into two main categories. These pupils were observed when completing the test and their responses were categorised accordingly. The resulting numerical data were then analysed for differences between pupils within each country and between their non-dyslexic counterparts. The results showed significant differences in the balance of cognitive styles employed by pupils with dyslexia as opposed to their non-dyslexic counterparts. Also there were interesting differences occurring between the pupils with dyslexia within the three countries on initial testing. Further differences were established after a six-month intervention period, suggesting that the characteristics of different curriculum models do have an impact upon pupils' flexibility as learners.

AB  - This research explored the factors of the adaptation for the children with disabilities studying in inclusive junior high schools. The subjects were recruited from the Special Needs Education Longitudinal Study of Taiwan. The result of the Confirmatory Factor Analyses reflects that there are two, three and five observed variables included in the intervention timing, language skills, and school adaptation respectively. Per structural equation modeling, the research found that the intervention timing impacts the children's language skills, and language skills impact the children's adaptation in inclusive junior high school setting. Based on the research findings, some implications for intervention practices are provided.

AB  - This study provided information on the academic effects of the existing co-teaching inclusion-model in a northern public school district in the State of New Jersey, in which students with learning disabilities are included in each grade level from kindergarten to second grade. Specifically, the investigation examined TerraNova test scores for two years for all students who were in inclusive and noninclusive classes, a survey for all co-teaching pairs of teachers and attendance records for the same group of students tested. The study focused on two approaches towards understanding the effects of co-teaching on academic achievement of students. The first approach, a quantitative analysis, reviewing students' TerraNova test score gains and attendance (during their first and second grade); and the second approach, analyzing the results of a survey provided to all pairs of teachers in co-teaching classrooms (from kindergarten to second grade). The two approaches provided the following results: (a) academic performance and attendance of both general-and special-education students in the co-teaching inclusion-model classrooms compared to their peers in the noninclusive classrooms, after one year, is significantly better; (b) there was no significant difference in job satisfaction for teachers placed in the co-teaching inclusion classroom, when compared to their peers, be they either general-or special-education teachers. Overall results of this study support the inclusive co-teaching approach; however, schools and districts can bring about student achievement and sustain that achievement if they are willing to examine their practices and embrace change. Co-teaching is just a part of the collaborative efforts needed in schools to increase instructional options, improve educational programs, increase professional dialogue, reduce stigmatization for students, reduce class size, and provide support to the professionals involved. To ignore this responsibility is to shortchange teachers and, more importantly, students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors investigate the effect of schooling on the aspirations of young people designated as having mild learning difficulties (MLD) or emotional and behavioural difficulties (EBD) in the first large-scale study of its kind in England. Data were collected from parents and their 15/16 year-old children in the final year of their compulsory schooling in schools. The results indicate on average a positive effect of mainstream schooling on the aspirations of these pupils with the caveat that these benefits are more likely to accrue to pupils whose parents are in higher status occupations. In their conclusions the authors discuss the implications of these results for education policy in the context of local management of schools.

AB  - Enhancing the social and learning experiences of students with severe disabilities in inclusive classrooms has been a long-standing focus of research, legislative, and advocacy efforts. The authors used a randomized controlled experimental design to examine the efficacy of peer support arrangements to improve academic and social outcomes for 51 students with severe disabilities in high school general education classrooms. Paraprofessionals or special educators recruited, trained, and supported 106 peers to provide individualized academic and social assistance to students with severe disabilities throughout one semester. Compared to students exclusively receiving adult-delivered support (n = 48), students participating in peer support arrangements experienced increased interactions with peers, increased academic engagement, more progress on individualized social goals, increased social participation, and a greater number of new friendships. Moreover, an appreciable proportion of relationships lasted one and two semesters later after the intervention had concluded. These findings challenge prevailing practices for supporting inclusive education and establish the efficacy and social validity of peer support arrangements as a promising alternative to individually assigned paraprofessional support.

AB  - Investigations of the post-16 outcomes for young people with a specific language impairment (SLI) are limited in scope. The current study extends our understanding of the young people's outcomes by examining the academic, employment and social outcomes of a cohort of pupils who attended a residential special school in the south east of England for pupils with SLI. Sixty participants ranging between 17 and 22 years of age completed a telephone survey. The survey examined education, work and training, leisure and social life and views about the future. As a cohort, the young people were adapting well to the demands of life as young adults, and a significant minority had entered higher education. The results are examined in three ways: a comparison of outcomes across the cohort, with national data for other young people with a history of special educational needs (SEN); identification of potentially vulnerable groups within the cohort and the identification of common transition experiences that reflect general current trends in the transition literature. The results thus contribute to models that aim to conceptualise transitions into adulthood and provide evidence to support educational polices and practice to support young people with SLI through these vital transition years.

AB  - Inclusion of students with disabilities in regular education environments is a recent and controversial educational initiative. Comparison of impact of special education structures and inclusive education structures on students interaction and friendship suggests a more positive impact occurs under inclusive education structures. Comments of typical students from ages 11 to 18 years interviewed for this study divided into five dynamics related to social life in their schools. Compared to findings for typical students educated under inclusive structures, those educated under special education structures made markedly fewer friendships with their peers with disabilities. Social interaction in schools with inclusive structures was commonplace, whereas special education structures restricted interaction. These dynamics were considered through the lenses of Bandura's social referencing theory and of Bourdieu's concepts of cultural capital and habitus.

Progress is reported for speech and language, literacy, socialization, daily living skills and behavior. For all the teenagers, there is evidence of progress with age on all the measures except for communication. Communication continued to improve through teenage years for the included children but not for those in special education classrooms. There were no significant differences in overall outcomes for daily living skills or socialization. However, there were large significant gains in expressive language and literacy skills for those educated in mainstream classrooms. Teenagers educated in mainstream classrooms showed fewer behavioral difficulties. Further, comparison with data published by these authors in an earlier study, showed no improvements in school achievements in special education over a 13-year period in the UK (1986-1999).

AB  - Responses to the School Factors Questionnaire (SFQ) administered to 222 students were used to ascertain student perceptions of alienating factors within secondary school environments. Descriptive statistics (i.e., frequency of responses to SFQ items) were used to report the data. The results indicated that although secondary students liked coming to school, regardless of their personal characteristics (i.e., placement in general vs. special education, gender, ethnicity), students reported similar alienating experiences associated with school life (e.g., the curriculum having little relevance to their lives, lack of pride concerning school, negative/no comments from principals and faculty, no involvement in curriculum planning). There needs to be a restructuring of secondary school environments before all students are able to re/connect to learning. The author discusses practical implications regarding what secondary school personnel can do to create more positive experiences for all students. (Contains 1 table and 1 figure.)

AB  - Student alienation is a major cause of dropping out of school, gang activity and poor peer, school-student, and teacher-student relationships. A considerable amount of research has focused on factors that distinguish between students who are engaged in the learning process and those who are not. This study examined the relationship between students and their perceptions of school life. A survey was distributed to over 200 students at two high schools in a large, urban school district in the southern United States. Results suggest that gender, race/ethnicity, and placement in special education are all strong factors in influencing whether students perceive school and/or life in general as alienating. The limitations of the study as well as future research directions and implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - Secondary education is increasingly recognised to be a time of challenge for many children with special educational needs (SEN), and particularly those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Individuals with ASD have a profile of needs, including social difficulties, sensory needs and anxiety, that make them particularly vulnerable within the secondary setting, and parents increasingly seek more specialist provision as their children reach secondary age. Building on these findings, this research study aimed to examine the secondary school experiences of children with ASD. This study adopted an ecosystemic perspective (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) and used a mixed-method multi-informant approach to examine both intrinsic child characteristics and wider systemic factors influencing the secondary school experiences of 16 children with ASD aged 11-15 years. Children attended a range of secondary provision including maintained and independent special, local mainstream and autism bases. This allowed for a thorough examination of children’s secondary school experiences, including investigation of differences by type of provision. Furthermore, this multi-informant approach revealed the views of children with ASD and their parents and teachers are not always consistent. Autistic behaviours were significantly associated with type of provision (mainstream versus special), yet cognitive ability, sensory symptoms and anxiety were not. The accounts of children, parents and teachers revealed the overall success of children’s secondary placements did not vary according to type of provision (mainstream versus special), although where children attended out of county provision, these placements were noticeably less successful. Difficulties primarily centred around the challenges of meeting the needs of cognitively able children whose ASD impacts on their ability to cope in mainstream schools. Children’s secondary school experiences were particularly influenced by their social vulnerability and feelings of difference. A range of systemic mitigating factors were identified, including transition preparation, teaching strategies, professional involvement, home-school communication and availability of provision. The findings have important implications for EPs, particularly with regards to providing training, transition support, and psychosocial interventions in school. The findings also highlight a crucial role for the EP in accessing children’s views, and mediating between parents and children where conflict exists.

AB  - The educational reforms of the last two decades have placed an increased demand on accountability and refocused efforts toward maximum achievement for all students, including those with disabilities. The goals of such reforms are that no child is left behind in achieving high standards. Under these reforms, exceptional education students who seek to earn a standard high school diploma are being held to the same standards as regular education students. This study provides information on the achievement of students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) in the standard diploma program in the Broward County School system. Students included in this study, were in the 10th grade during the 2003-2004 school year and were administered the 10th grade Sunshine State Standards (SSS) FLAT. They also were enrolled in the standard diploma program and had been diagnosed with a Specific Learning Disability. In addition, enrollment in the Broward County School system for a minimum of seven consecutive years was mandatory along with having FCAT SSS scores in both reading and math for three consecutive years. A sample of all of the students (N=278) that met the specified criteria was utilized. To investigate the relationship among the variables---achievement, ESE services, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender---correlations, descriptive statistics, and regressions were used. Some of the findings were that students have a higher pass rate on the math achievement test (57 percent passed) than they do on the reading achievement test (32 percent passed). However, Black, Hispanic, and White students did not benefit equally from ESE services. Further, a statistically significant moderate correlational relationship exists between FCAT reading and FCAT math scores. This research explained less than a quarter of the variation in the achievement levels analyzed; therefore, further longitudinal research is needed to continue to evaluate the effectiveness of special education programs.

AB  - Introduction: The present study assesses the performance of students who are visually impaired (that is, those who are blind or have low vision) in braille reading accuracy and examines potential correlations among the error categories on the basis of gender, age at loss of vision, and level of education. Methods: Twenty-one visually impaired Greek school-aged children participated in the present study. The students who participated were enrolled in different educational settings; that is, special schools and mainstream educational settings. The research tool was a subset (three subscales) of a standardized instrument (Test A, Padeliadu & Antoniou, 2008) that evaluates reading accuracy in Greek. All interactions between researchers and students were videotaped, and the analysis of the obtained data was focused on phonological and nonphonological-type errors. Results: Significant differences in performance were found between male and female participants—t(19) = 2.12, p = .05—as well as between students who attained primary and secondary education: t(19) = 1.96, p = .05. The average number of errors in the three subscales correlated very highly, signifying that performance was very similar. Positive correlation was found between replacement and subtraction types of error (p = .05), and replacement and recognition (p = .001), and the total number of errors was positively correlated with replacement (p = .001), subtraction (p = .001), and recognition errors (p = .001). Male participants made more replacement errors: t(19) = 2.09, p = .05; participants in secondary education made significantly fewer errors of recognition: t(19) = 2.49, p = .05; and students who were congenitally blind made significantly more errors of addition: t(19) = 1.96, p = .05. Regarding the recognition type of error, there was a significant interaction effect between grade and age at loss of vision: F(3/17) = 3.09, p = .05. Discussion: Participants did not benefit exceptionally from semantic information, and it is unclear whether a higher school level leads to the improvement of braille reading accuracy. 'Reading the entire word' seems the most effective decoding strategy. Nevertheless, further research is needed to obtain relevant data from longitudinal studies. Implications for practitioners: Listing and analyzing braille reading errors systematically may reveal error patterns. Based on these patterns, teachers would be able to differentiate their instruction to improve students’ performances in braille speed and accuracy.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to determine similarities and differences in the articulation of speech sounds of the Croatian language by prelingually deaf pupils, attending a special secondary school and a regular secondary school. The investigation was made by using the Articulation test, by which the articulation of speech sounds in initial, medial, as well as in the final position in a word is being assessing. The quality of the articulation was also analyzed according to place and manner of articulation. The results obtained confirm in a large part the results from previous investigations in this area. The subjects from the regular school articulated correctly 85%, and the pupils from the special school 75% of the speech sounds investigated. The order of sound groups according to manner and place of articulation in both groups of subjects was the same. Most specifically both groups articulated vowels (97/100%), followed by sonorant consonants (85/97%); and both groups had the most difficulties with obstruent consonants (69/78%). Further results are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This action research project looked at the effects of the amount of inclusion for students who were diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome or High Functioning Autism through transition outcomes. The population for the study was students who attended high school in the past five years, received special education services (autism), and attended a school in an education district in Central Minnesota. Mailed surveys asked questions in transition areas of employment, dropout rates, independent living, and quality of life. The results of the survey were calculated and analyzed by frequency and percentiles. Inclusion time was compared to outcome success rates; the results showed a relationship between the amount of inclusion time and transition success rates. The results from this study may motivate further study in this area; and will provide significant information for educators interested in best practice in learning environments for students diagnosed with Autism.

AB  - Repeated poor performance by students with special needs on the Indiana Statewide Test of Educational Progress (ISTEP) in an Indiana middle school supported the need for instructional changes. Following the implementation of a full inclusion program, a problem arose in that the program had not been evaluated and effectiveness was in question. This study, grounded in the constructivist and social reproduction theoretical frameworks, is important in explaining the effectiveness of a fully inclusive school. Whether placing middle school aged children with special needs in inclusive classrooms in the middle school setting is an effective practice is the research question guiding this work. A program evaluation was used to determine effectiveness by examining same student test score data in math and English from 2005 through 2007. The 2007 test scores reflected the first scores following a full year of inclusion. The test score data were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA to study overall performance from year to year. The findings of the project show that inclusion had a significant positive effect on ISTEP scores and is an effective method of instructing children with special needs in the least restrictive environment. The information gained from this work could be used to provide improved learning opportunities for middle school students with special needs in their current setting as well as influence their future learning opportunities through high school and beyond resulting in positive social change. Students with special needs may realize higher graduation rates and academic success while this work could be used to guide the implementation of an inclusion program by examining the methods explained in this paper.

AB  - In this article, we describe results of a reanalysis of two randomized studies that tested the effects of enhanced anchored instruction (EAI) on the fractions computation performance of students in special education resource rooms and inclusive mathematics classrooms. Latent class analysis and latent transition analysis classified students according to error subtypes and tracked their performance patterns. Results indicated that EAI was more effective than business as usual in reducing combining errors (e.g., adding denominators) and denominator errors (e.g., not finding common denominator) of students with disabilities (SWD) and students without disabilities in both settings. SWD in inclusive classrooms scored higher on the pretest than SWD in resource rooms, but EAI reduced the disparity on the posttest. An important additional finding revealed that the SWD who received more support from special education teachers in inclusive classrooms scored higher and made fewer errors than the SWD who were provided only limited support.

AB  - This study compared children with physical disabilities (PD), learning disabilities (LD) and no disabilities (ND) in terms of their reported numbers of friends, quality of friendships, self-concept and social attributions. It further explored the relationship between these facets of social functioning in all three groups. Seventy-one 10 to 14-year-old participants were recruited from four settings: a full-time special education program for children with physical disabilities (PD-FT) (n = 15), an integrated program for children with physical disabilities (PD-RC) (n = 12), a program for students with learning disabilities (LD) (n = 16), and a regular classroom program (ND) (n = 27). All participants were administered the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1985), a friendship nomination measure (Wiener, 1995), the Friendship Quality Questionnaire (Parker & Asher, 1993), the Peer Social Attributions Questionnaire (Hoza, 1993), a friendship attributions interview, and, where applicable, a modified version of the Mossford Assessment Chart for the Physically Handicapped (Whitehouse, 1983). Questionnaires were given to all participants' teachers, and telephone interviews conducted with their parents. Results indicated that there were no group differences in self-concept. However, children with PD differed from both their LD and ND peers in reporting friendships of poorer quality. Students in the PD-FT group further reported lower quality of friendship than their PD-RC peers. Moreover, children with PD displayed different attributional patterns for both actual and hypothetical friendship situations than children with ND. Children with PD attributed positive social outcome less often to others than their ND peers, and less often acknowledged the importance of their own lack of effort in negative friendship interactions. These findings are significant in the context of results from the entire sample, which revealed a positive relationship between self-attributions and self-concept as well as quality of friendship. The present findings help explain the controversial accounts of intact self-concept coupled with poor peer relations often reported in the literature on children with PD. Implications for educational and clinical practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Communicative disorders can complicate social interactions and may be detrimental for one's self-concept. This study aims to assess the self-concept of children with Cochlear Implants (CI). Results of educational peer groups (special needs or typical) were compared. Correlations amongst speech perception, language comprehension, self-concept and other study variables are determined. This retrospectively patient file study contained 53 CI participants with a mean age of 14.2 (SD = 2.8). Self-concept was measured with the Dutch language version of the Self-Perception Profile for Children and Adolescents. Proportions of low, normal and high competence scores were compared to a normative sample. Outcomes were analyzed for the total CI group and for the two educational peer groups. Results : In the Scholastic Competence, Athletic Competence, Physical Appearance and Behavioral Conduct domains larger proportions of high perceived competence levels were found in the CI Total group compared to the hearing normative sample. Children with CIs in the Mainstream educational subgroup were found to have larger proportions of high levels on these domains. Remarkably, children with CI in the Special hearing impaired educational subgroup reported comparable self-concept scores as their hearing peers. Speech perception and language comprehension were positively correlated to Scholastic Competence. This study has shown that self-concept levels of profoundly hearing impaired children with CI are comparable to those of hearing peers. They are generally satisfied with their functioning in various domains. Better speech perception and language comprehension levels are related to higher outcomes in the Scholastic Competence domain.

AB  - The paper presents a model for addressing the critical question of opportunity to learn for students with disabilities. The model was tested through a two-year study with schools and teachers in three states. Opportunity to learn analysis is critical in this educational era of push toward access and inclusion. The study results indicate that instruction in grades 4-8 for general education and special education students did not closely align to state content standards. The analysis results indicate that a greater degree of instructional alignment to standards did have a positive impact on student achievement, considering both academic standards and extended standards for students with disabilities. The study findings showed that schools and classrooms providing more inclusive education for students with disabilities had a positive impact on student achievement for all students.

AB  - Including students with disabilities in general education classrooms continues to challenge educators when considering the ideal academic placement. To secure the optimal educational placement while fostering positive self-esteem, educators need to consider academic and emotional concerns. This study presented opposing self-esteem theories that predict both positive and negative outcomes based on academic placement. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect classroom placement has on the self-esteem of secondary school students with learning disabilities. Qualitative research was employed in order to examine the perceptions of six secondary school students with learning disabilities who have experienced academic placement in classrooms with and without general education students. The use of triangulated data collection included a complex analysis of participant interviews, educational records, self-esteem questionnaires, teacher evaluations, psychological and academic assessments, and classroom observations. The researcher administered and evaluated a series of self-esteem assessments from participants, family members, and educators. Additional information was gathered directly from participants using conversational interviews. Experts in the field of educational disability, psychological assessment, and interview coding, analyzed and validated the findings of the study. Additionally, a series of classroom observations and a comprehensive review of educational records provided a holistic and accurate view of each participant. The findings of this study provide support to special education policy makers and practitioners by acknowledging and verifying that the inclusion of secondary school students with learning disabilities in general education classrooms is likely to produce a more positive self-esteem and improve academic achievement. The results of the current study support the inclusion of secondary school students with learning disabilities in the general education classroom as an essential variable that promotes positive self-esteem.

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to examine the relationship between the amount of time a student with special needs spends in the inclusive classroom and their achievement passing rates in mathematics and reading. TAKS passing rates for mathematics and reading for third graders in 2007-2008, and the same cohort of fourth graders in 2008-2009 were analyzed to determine the strength of relationship between the predictor variable of TAKS achievement passing rates, and the independent variables of amount of time included (PEIMS Instructional Setting) and socioeconomic status. Logistic regression was utilized to analyze the relationship between amount of time included and TAKS achievement passing rates in reading and mathematics. Correlations and crosstabulations were also employed to provide deeper insight into the data analysis. Logistic regression in mathematics demonstrated a strong correlation between the amount of time student with special needs was included in the general education setting and their TAKS achievement passing rates in both years of the study. Correlations and crosstabulations further enhanced these findings with higher passing rates correlated with greater amounts of time included. Logistic regression in reading demonstrated correlation between the amount of time a student with special needs was included in the general education setting for greater than half of their school day and their TAKS achievement passing rates in reading for both years of the study. Correlations and crosstabulations showed increased passing rates in TAKS reading for those students included for more than fifty percent of the day, and decreased passing rates in TAKS reading for those students included for less than fifty percent of the day. One interesting discovery was the link between socioeconomic status and student achievement passing rates on TAKS. Statistical analyses showed no correlation between SES and mathematics in 2007-2008 or 2008-2009. The same analyses showed no correlation between SES and reading in 2007-2008, but found correlation between SES and reading in 2008-2009. It is possible that student disability eclipses socioeconomic status, and the appropriate type of TAKS test may alleviate some of the effects of socioeconomic status generally reported in the research on student achievement. A lengthy discussion of the development and implementation of culturally responsive systems, instruction, and achievement testing followed the statistical analysis of the data. Systemic reform measures involving the changing of mindsets toward culturally responsive instruction is foundational to addressing the issues of equity and diversity at the heart of the differentials in achievement among typically developing students and students with special needs. Finally, recommendations were made regarding systems change as well as future research in the area of inclusion and student achievement. Research which examines the impact of inclusion upon students, parents, teachers, schools, and communities will provide data which paves the way for change in the hearts and minds of society.

AB  - This study examined the academic impact in reading and mathematics when Collaborative, Co-Teaching Team Model of high incidence special education student service delivery implemented in a suburban school district. This study hypothesized that the implementation of an inclusive collaborative co-teaching model of service delivery could possibly impact students with disabilities math and reading performance in a significant manner, either positive or negative. The study also laid out a potential path for the team creation of a model. The study was significant in that there is increased political and public pressure on public school districts today to utilize service delivery models that are referred to as inclusion. The term full inclusion is also used, meaning inclusion for the full day for all disability categories of students with disabilities. Currently, many attempts at inclusionary service delivery have been what are termed full inclusion. The way in which this service is delivered varies greatly. The other model that has been much more prevalent for more than thirty years is referred to as a resource room model. In this model students with disabilities are identified and pulled out of the general education classroom for 30 to 45 minute blocks, taught in smaller groups ranging from five to fifteen students, however, often missing significant general education instruction in an area of need. This study demonstrated that the Collaborative Team Model based upon co-teaching offers a potential service delivery model for students with disabilities' academic growth. It was hypothesized that with this model, students gained skills in math and reading, and as a result the district will be placed in a better position to not become a school of failure. The study population was created by three criteria. Each student selected for the students with disabilities group had attended the school district for the entire time of the study. In addition they have taken the AIMS Reading and Mathematics tests each year of the study and been taught in the co-teaching model for the two years of full implementation. The population was made up of 93 students with diagnosed disabilities from various schools in one district. The major findings of the study discovered that the implementation of a collaborative, co-teaching model did not result in significant mathematics gain or loss, the null hypothesis was retained. In overall reading, the result was also non-significant and the null was retained. When looking at grade level subsets, only the seventh grade reading showed a significant rate of growth.

AB  - Instruction of students with specific learning disabilities presents unique challenges to school districts. Federal legislation such as No Child Left Behind has placed greater emphasis on district accountability for student achievement, particularly sub populations like special education students. Different instructional models are used by districts throughout the South Texas region and may have significant implications for student achievement. This concurrent triangulation mixed methods study sought to determine if a significant difference existed among students with specific learning disabilities educated in inclusive settings and resource settings, as measured by 9th grade State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness (STAAR) End of Course (EOC) exams in reading and math. The researcher concurrently conducted open-ended, semi-structured interviews with high school principals and lead special education personnel in 4A and larger South Texas district to gain further insight into successful and unsuccessful inclusive practices. An ANCOVA was conducted and quantitative findings indicate no significant differences in assessment scores between students with learning disabilities who received resource services and students with learning disabilities who did not receive resource services. Qualitative analysis revealed the themes of relationships, individualized programs, time, staff and training. Respondents emphasized the importance of building relationships between inclusion and general education teachers, as well as between teachers and students. They also indicated a need for individualized services to meet the unique needs of each student. Time, staff and training were identified as factors affecting the successful implementation of inclusion services. Districts need to schedule time for planning and collaboration among teachers. Districts must also have enough staff to provide the needed services, whether it be resource or inclusion. Training was recommended for all teachers.

AB  - This study compared tenth grade scores on the Indiana Statewide Testing for Educational Progress (ISTEP) assessment in the Lafayette School Corporation in mathematics and language arts. The sample was taken from a high school with a total enrollment of 1,990 students, 296 of whom were considered special needs students. Data were gathered for the 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 school years. The ISTEP was instituted as a graduation qualification examination in 2000. The study analyzed the effects of including special education students' scores in ISTEP results. Ex post facto research was used to compare data from the comparison years to the treatment and posttreatment years. Findings indicate that the inclusion of special needs students did not have a significant effect on ISTEP scores. (Author/SLD)

AB  - Young people with disabilities face difficulties in the post-school transition, yet little research has examined the impact of classroom placement on these outcomes for young people with learning, mental, emotional, and behavioral disabilities. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, this study compares transition outcomes of young people without disabilities (N = 6,447) with those of young people who have a disability and have been in special education (N = 242), remedial classes (N = 51), and general education (N = 430). Young people with disabilities in all groups struggle considerably more in educational and social domains than those without disabilities. Special education is associated with high school completion, but does not protect against other negative outcomes. Young people with emotional, mental, and behavioral disabilities struggle considerably, regardless of education placement. The results suggest a need to revisit how well education placement options are meeting their mandate for young people with disabilities. There is evidently a need to explore interventions for young people with emotional and behavioral difficulties, as current placement options are not meeting their needs.

AB  - The present paper is an outcome of research conducted by authors to examine the effect of gender, degree of impairment and type of school on the mental health of students with visual impairment. The study employed multi-stage random sampling technique to draw a sample of 200 visually impaired students from 52 inclusive and 5 special schools situated in different parts of Haryana State, India. Mental Health Battery for students with visual impairment, consisting of 61 items to assess their mental health status. Multiple regression and two-way ANOVA was used to analyse the data. The results revealed that three independent variables (gender, degree of impairment and type of school) made a joint contribution of 22.1% to the prediction of mental health of visually impaired students. Significant main effect of degree of visual impairment on mental health was observed whereas no significant main effect for gender was established.

AB  - Researchers have extensively studied the effects of placement on academic and behavioral interventions for students with disabilities and have found varying results. A correlational research design was used to determine if there was a relationship between the level of special education support (amount of time spent with special education support) for students with emotional behavior disorders (EBD) and student achievement in reading and math as measured by performance on the Georgia Criterion Referenced Competency Test (CRCT). The study included 81 students with EBD in a small rural school district in Georgia in grades six through eight over the 2007–2008, 2008–2009, and 2009–2010 school years. The results of this study indicated that there is little relationship between the level of special education instructional support and the academic achievement in reading and math of students with EBD. Findings showed that student mean math scale scores were below the acceptable range of proficiency in all three-grade levels. Recommendations for practical application and future research were included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined social self-concept and academic self-concept differences between students with learning disabilities in inclusive and non-inclusive classrooms as measured by the Multidimensional Self Concept Scale (MSCS). Reading and mathematics achievement differences were measured by the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT-9). Fifty-one students in seventh and eighth grade with similar demographics from two neighboring urban middle schools participated from inclusive and non-inclusive settings. One middle school practiced inclusion of students with learning disabilities in regular education classes whereas the other middle school had programs for students with learning disabilities in special education classes. Data analysis employing t-tests followed after data collection at the end of the school year. Significant differences were not found between the two groups in academic and social self-concept and academic achievement in reading and mathematics.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of inclusion education programmes with special education programmes on physical fitness levels of children with mental challenges. Methods: Participants were 69 elementary school students with mental challenges. Thirty-four children with a mean age of 12.3 ± 2.4 were included in an inclusion physical education programme with non-disabled peers. In addition, 35 children with a mean age of 12.1 ± 1.8 participated in a special class for children with mental challenges. Balance tests, grip strength and Brockport Physical Fitness Test (BPFT) were used to evaluate the physical fitness levels of children. Results: Results indicated that physical fitness parameters; 20 metre shuttle run, push-up, trunk lift, vertical jump and balance test scores were significantly lower in children in the special class (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, calf skinfold thickness, grip strength in dominant hand, sit and reach test and modified Apley test (p > 0.05). Conclusion: The physical fitness level was better in children with mental challenges who were participating in an inclusion programme with non-disabled peers. Therefore, it is recommended for children with mental challenges to be part of an inclusion programme with their non-disabled peers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study examined the impact of a sixth grade inclusion program on academic performance, attitudes toward peers who have difficulty learning, and the self esteem of these students with special needs. It was hypothesized that regular education children in inclusion classes would show improved attitudes toward children with disabilities after having been integrated with them for the school year. Regular education children in non-inclusion classes were not expected to show improved attitudes toward special education children and were expected to have lower scores than the regular education children in the inclusion setting at the end of the school year. The Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons scale (ATDP: Yuker, Block & Younng, 1968) was used to measure attitudes toward children who have learning problems. It was hypothesized that disabled children in inclusion classes would have increased self esteem after being placed in an inclusion setting for the school year and would have higher self esteem than similar students placed in a traditional resource room program or self-contained class. The Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT: The Psychological Corporation, 1992) was used to measure academic gains. It was also hypothesized that the disabled children in the inclusion program would show similar academic gains from the previous year as disabled children in the resource room program. The Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale-Revised (Piers, 1984) was used to measure self esteem. All participants were 6th graders. Data was collected on 239 students consisting of 160 non-classified children in regular education, 32 non-classified children in an inclusion program, 11 classified children who received services in an inclusion program, 23 who received services in a resource room setting and 13 classified children in a self-contained class setting. The attitude and self esteem measures were administered to this sample in September and May of the 1997-1998 academic school year while the academic tests were administered in the Spring of 1997 and again in the Spring of 1998. Covariance analysis indicated no significant differences between classified children in the inclusion program, those in the resource room group, or in the self-contained class group on the self-concept measure. There were also no significant differences between the non-classified children in the inclusion program or in the regular education setting on the attitude measure. Independent samples t-tests indicated that the classified Inclusion group showed significantly more academic growth than the classified resource room group on one academic subtest, mathematical reasoning. Based on this limited sample, results suggest that inclusion programs of one year do not offer substantially greater benefits than those resulting from the more traditional special education.

AB  - A study of 24 handicapped students functioning on or below grade level was conducted to examine their reading achievement in three different reading programs. The students were placed in a remedial reading program, a reading program in a resource room, or a regular reading class depending on past grade achievements and recommendations of former teachers and child study teams. Pretests and posttests were administered to measure reading achievement. Results showed that there was no significant difference in gain among the three groups, indicating that handicapped students who are mainstreamed into regular classes fare as well as their counterparts in self-contained classes. Further, the stigma of being members of special education classes is removed when students are mainstreamed. (TJ)

AB  - Public schools traditionally have been held accountable for educating the majority of the nation’s school children, and through the years, these schools have been evaluated in a variety of ways. Currently, evaluation measures for accountability purposes consist solely of standardized test scores. In the past, only test scores of general education students were analyzed. Laws governing the education of students with disabilities, however, have extended accountability measures not only to include those students, but to report their scores in a disaggregated form (No Child Left Behind Act, 2001). The recent emphasis on accountability and compliance has resulted in the need for schools to carefully examine how programs, services, and policies impact student achievement (Bowers & Figgers, 2003). Standard-based school reform and accountability systems have raised expectations about student learning outcomes for all students, including those with disabilities and minority students. Yet, overall, racial/ethnic minority students are performing well below their White non-Hispanic peers in most academic areas. Additionally, with respect to special education, there exists an enduring problem of disproportionate representation of racial/ethnic minority students (National Research Council, 2000). This study examined classroom placement (inclusive versus non-inclusive) relative to academic performance of urban, low socioeconomic Hispanic students with and without disabilities in secondary content area classrooms. A mixed method research design was used to investigate this important issue using data from a local school district and results from field observations. The study compared performance levels of four middle school Hispanic student subgroups (students with disabilities in inclusive settings, students without disabilities in inclusive settings, students with disabilities in resource settings, and student without disabilities in general education settings) each in their respective placements for two consecutive years, exploring existing practices within authentic settings. Significant differences were found in the relationship of educational placement and achievement between grade level and disability in the areas of math and reading. Additionally, clear and important differences were observed in student-teacher interactions. Recommendations for further researchers and stakeholders include soliciting responses from teams at the schools composed of general education and special education teachers, administrative personnel, and students as well as broadening the study across grade levels and exceptionalities.

AB  - In a recently published research article in this journal, Avramidis & Skidmore (2004) argued that it is time we placed issues of disability provision more in the context of provision for the generic student. They presented a study based on the Learning for All Questionnaire (LfAQ), which investigated certain implied issues. Findings indicated a need for improved educational provision for all students. No differences were found between disabled and non-disabled students in perceived level of needs or support for university, tutoring and lecturing systems. This null finding was the same for the learning support needs of disabled versus non-disabled students, with both groups wanting identical changes to the way the university's central learning support service responds to learning needs. These findings were taken as calling for a move away from a 'specialist' framework of disability provision and towards a 'mainstream' framework instead, in which the needs of disabled students are accommodated within improvements made in learning for all. Further, the Disabled Students' Allowance should be given over to departments in order to help fund this change in 'institutional habitus'. In this article, four serious failings of the study and analyses are outlined. When these are addressed in a disability-theoretic reanalysis of the LfAQ data, every main finding is reversed. It is concluded that educational provisions are generally adequate. Students would welcome changes but these are more to do with increasing levels of convenience rather than learning support issues.

AB  - This study focused on the relationship between both achievement level and diagnostic label and sociometric status and self-image of students in Dutch elementary education. In particular, differences between students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) and students with general learning disabilities (GLD) were studied, in regular as well as in special education. A total of 1,300 students participated, 861 in general and 439 in (separate) special education schools. Students with GLD were more often rejected and had a lower self-image than students with SLD. These results seemed to hold mainly for girls and for students with GLD in general education. No argument in favor of or against inclusive education can be advanced based on the results of this study, but the findings highlight the potential role of low achievement in peers' dislike of girls. Moreover, the results suggest the importance of investigating subgroups of students with LD in future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Volumes 22 and 23 of "Advances in Special Education" address the current top perspectives and issues in the field of EBD by providing chapters written by active researchers and scholarly university professors who specialize in this area. Volume 22 first delineates legal issues, themes, and dimensions related to the historical development of the EBD field. Then this volume addresses best practices for the assessment and placement of students with EBD. These discussions are followed by innovative examinations of critical issues that have faced the field of EBD for many years such as the disproportionate placement of culturally and linguistically diverse learners with EBD, prevention strategies for at-risk students with EBD and the dilemma of instructing English language learners with EBD. The volume concludes with comprehensive discussions of instructional issues such as the effective use of behavioral modification techniques to develop appropriate behavior, the need to differentiate instruction to produce positive academic change and a rational for using multidimensional intervention choices for culturally linguistic learners with EBD. Following a preface by Jeffrey P. Bakken, Festus E. Obiakor, and Anthony F. Rotatori, chapters presented in this volume include: (1) Legal Issues and Teachers of Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders (Mitchell L. Yell, Shelley L. Neilsen Gatti); (2) Themes and Dimensions of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders (April L. Mustian, Yojanna Cuenca-Sanchez); (3) Assessment of Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders (Cynthia A. Plotts); (4) Placement of Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders (Sarup R.

AB  - With the reauthorization of Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) in 2004, more demands are being placed on schools to provide special education services within the general education classroom. The law states that students with disabilities should only be removed from their general education classroom when the nature and severity of the disability is such that instruction in the regular education classroom can not be achieved satisfactorily, even with the use of supplementary aids and services (Waldron & McLeskey, 1998). IDEA also states that students with disabilities will be provided with instruction that meets the student's own specific needs, which will be made available at no cost to parents. (IDEA, 2004). In 1975, when special education services were first mandated, schools began to implement programs in which students with learning disabilities in need of specialized instruction were generally 'taken out' of their general education classrooms. Students were then provided specialized instruction mostly in a small group setting in a resource room, which was taught by a teacher who was certified in special education. The purpose of these programs was to provide students with disabilities an intensive, individualized program of instruction in the deficit area (Moody, Vaughn, Hughes. & Fischer, 2000). However, more and more school districts are utilizing inclusive general education settings to provide the necessary support to these students. Two types of inclusive general education settings are a co-taught classroom and a single-teacher taught classroom. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reading instruction and the perceptions of three fourth grade students with learning disabilities in a co-taught classroom, a resource room or a single-teacher taught classroom as well as their teachers. The focus was on the perceived and observed differences and similarities between each of the three classroom settings. Qualitative research methods were utilized in this study to collect data. These methods included classroom observations, student interviews, teacher interviews, field notes, and audio tapes. Research questions guided the study and the data was analyzed and reported on consistent with qualitative studies. This study suggests that students with learning disabilities who receive reading instruction in a resource room, a co-taught classroom, or a single-teach taught classroom all perceived themselves as good readers. These students also believed that purpose of reading is to read at higher levels. The students also felt like their teachers supported their reading skills in numerous ways. This study also suggests that the general educations teachers view their reading instruction that they provide to students with learning disabilities much the same as they view instruction for the general education students. The special education teacher who co-taught in the general education room was more likely to provide individualized instruction on a daily basis, as she met with her students with learning disabilities every day in the general education classroom. The resource room teacher viewed the direct instruction in the resource room for her students with learning disabilities as imperative. Many similarities and differences between the general education special education classroom settings were uncovered in this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There are discrepant views regarding the education system of visually impaired children. Special schools are working only where special need children are being taught by the special teachers. On the contrary in integrated schools these children are taught with the help of some desirable facilities along with normal children. The difference between environments of both type of schools affect the adjustment of special need children. This study attempts to study the adjustment pattern of visually impaired children of special and integrated schools. For this purpose 200 visually impaired children were randomly selected from special and integrated schools. Adjustment Inventory for School Students (AISS) by Dr. A.K. Singh and Dr. R.P. Singh was the tool used. The tool was also transcribed in Braille. The study found that visually impaired children from both educational set up have average level of adjustment. Boys and girls do not differ significantly on adjustment. Girls of integrated schools having good emotional adjustment and boys are indicating average emotional adjustment. Gender does not affect the social and educational adjustment.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine whether gender and inclusion settings are associated with elementary school pupils' aspects of social development such as aggression, social insecurity and attitudes toward disability. The sample consisted of 658 pupils (M[age]=11=1 years) of 15 primary schools (306 boys and 352 girls). Three hundred and fifty three of the participants attended schools with inclusive settings while the rest 305 attended typical schools. The participants of the study completed the Checklist of Aggressive Behaviour (CAB), the Checklist of Social Insecure Behaviour (CSIB), and the Children's Attitudes Towards Integrated Physical Education -- Revised (CAIPE-R). Results indicated that girls showed less aggressive behaviour compared to boys, and pupils in typical schools displayed higher attitudes toward disability compared to pupils in inclusion schools. These findings imply that gender is a significant factor just for students displaying aggression but not social insecurity and/or adopting positive attitudes towards disability. Furthermore, inclusive setting is not a sufficient condition for the promotion of typical pupils' social behaviour. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Inclusion of handicap students in regular schools has attracted teacher's attention. In some schools, handicap student are inserted in regular classes, nevertheless without an effective participation in activities. As an aggravate factor, it's known that handicap children generally present an extremely passive leisure, with little motor experiences. In order to verify the handicap students situation in physical education classes, the aim of this study was to analyze health-related physical fitness variables of blind adolescents. Twenty-four blind adolescents, 12 of regular state schools e 12 of one special private school, with ages between 14 and 16 years old, had measured some anthropometric variables, flexibility, muscular strength and cardio-respiratory endurance. Both groups participated in physical education classes twice per week. It was observed that special school adolescents presented better results in muscular strength and cardio-respiratory endurance than the ones in regular school. By the results, it's possible to conclude that special school adolescents presented better levels of health-related physical fitness than others in regular schools. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] A inclusão de alunos com deficiências nas escolas regulares tem atraído a atenção dos educadores. Em algumas escolas, alunos com deficiências são inseridos em turmas regulares, porém sem efetiva participação nas atividades. Ainda como fator agravante, sabe-se que jovens com deficiência em geral apresentam seu lazer extremamente passivo, com poucas oportunidades de vivências motoras. Visando a analisar a situação de alunos com deficiência participando de aulas de educação física, este estudo objetivou a análise de variáveis da aptidão física relacionadas à saúde de adolescentes cegos. Para tanto, 24 adolescentes cegos com idades entre 14 e 16 anos, sendo 12 de escolas regulares estaduais e 12 de uma escola especial privada, tiveram mensuradas algumas variáveis antropométricas, flexibilidade, força muscular e resistência cardiorrespiratória. Ambos os grupos de alunos participavam das aulas de educação física com uma frequência de duas vezes por semana. Foi verificado que, nas variáveis força muscular e resistência cardiorrespiratória, os adolescentes da escola especial apresentaram resultados superiores e melhor evolução do que seus colegas das escolas regulares. Pelos resultados obtidos concluise que os adolescentes da escola especial apresentaram melhor nível de aptidão física relacionada à saúde do que seus colegas inseridos em escolas regulares.

AB  - The focus in this study is on social competence and behavioural problems in a group (n=57) of hearing-impaired 7- to 12-year-old children. Results were related to hearing status, school placement, and gender. Parent and teacher questionnaires were used to measure two aspects of social competence, prosocial orientation and social initiative, and three aspects of behavioural problems, externalizing, internalizing, and concentration problems. A sample of 214 normally-hearing children was used as a comparison group. Overall, the results showed only minor differences between the two groups, with the exception that the hearing-impaired children showed less social initiative in parent ratings. There were no relationships between social functioning and hearing status or school placement (mainstream vs. special classes for hearing-impaired children) nor any clear pattern of gender differences. These Endings indicate that hearing-impaired children in Sweden fare well. The results are discussed in terms of the need for longitudinal studies and possible interventions targeted at social behaviours.

AB  - Today the new trend in educating students with hearing impairment in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is to educate these students in public schools with hearing students. One of the assumptions for educating deaf students in public schools is the expected benefit of students with hearing impairment learning how to interact with their normally hearing peers. This assumption is based on the theory that students with hearing impairment will benefit from exposure to their hearing peers who can serve as models of developmentally appropriate social behavior. The issues surrounding the educational placement and social development of students with hearing impairment are numerous. The social adjustment skills of students with hearing impairment have been discussed in several studies. The results of these studies indicate that students with hearing impairment differ in their social development and social adjustment skills according to the type of the educational setting and program. These studies have provided conflicting results about the social development of students with hearing impairment in special schools for the deaf and those in public schools. Since programs for students with hearing impairment have increased in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as have the options for educational placement, educators have not explored the issue of social development. The present study investigated the social development of students with hearing impairment enrolled in special schools for the deaf and in public schools in Riyadh City in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study investigated whether the social competence and social adjustment skills of students with hearing impairment differ significantly according to the type of educational placement, program, and gender. Three hundred seventy-five students with hearing impairment were selected from special schools for the deaf and public schools in Riyadh to participate in this study. Two scales were used to examine peer relations, academic behavior, self management, and social adjustment. The two scales used were the Social Emotional Assessment Inventories (SEAI) (Meadow, 1983), and the School Social Behavior Scales (SSBS-2) (Merrell, 2002). A series of statistical analyses were used to determine if there is a significant difference in the peer relationship, academic behavior, self-management, and social adjustment scores of students with hearing impairment according to the type of educational setting, program, and student gender. The findings of this study indicated that there were no significant differences in peer relations, academic behavior, self-management, and social adjustment of students with hearing impairment relative to the educational setting and program. Also, the results indicated that there were no significant differences related to the student's gender in academic behavior and self-management. However, the findings of this study indicated that there were significant differences between male and female students in peer relations and social adjustment.

AB  - As education continues to progress schools are constantly seeking innovative ways to cultivate and enhance achievement for all students. As a result many public schools are pushing toward the inclusion model. This model includes co-taught instruction to meet the many needs of special education students. This research study was implemented to investigate the comparative effects of co-teaching versus solo-teaching on student's math achievement in elementary school. Study participants included two fourth grade classes in an elementary school, one with a regular education (solo-teaching) and the other with the same regular education teacher and a special education teacher for the co-taught class. The independent variable is the teaching arrangement (co taught class vs. a solo-taught class) as considered by the school system and the dependent variable is the math achievement as measured by Number Sense, Multiplication, and Division pre and post test units. Comparison of student math achievement between co-teaching and solo-teaching showed that solo teaching was more effective than co-teaching on student's achievement in Multiplication, co-teaching was more effective on student achievement in the Number sense unit than solo-teaching, and that no statistical difference was shown between co-teaching and solo teaching in their effect on student learning in the Division unit. It is concluded that both solo teaching and co-teaching were beneficial to the two different groups of students within their various learning environments. Further experimental research is needed.

AB  - This study investigated classroom climate in relation to social context, heterogeneity (disability, multiculturalism) in class composition, and the occurrence of differentiated learning environments for children who need special support. Pupils aged 8-12 (679 from 39 classes in Swedish compulsory schools) responded to a questionnaire about classroom climate. 80 of these students receive special support at school using various modalities. Multilevel factor analysis was applied to data to estimate differences within and between groups. Three significant climate factors were found. They pertained to the level of friction, satisfaction, and cohesiveness in the classroom. Social context was related to these three factors and to the occurrence of differentiated learning environments. The inclusion of pupils with disabilities appears to be related to less friction and higher cohesiveness among children. The article proposes increased interventions aimed at improving the school climate in disadvantaged neighborhoods. It also suggests that aspects of the placement of pupils with disabilities and of the organization of special support should be considered as indicators in studies of school effectiveness.

Through a combination of personal and telephone interviews, the study identified relationships between students' background characteristics, school experiences, and their post school experiences. The results indicated that there were significant outcome differences by disability group as well as significant predictors of post school outcomes. Respondents' participation in inclusion schools was a significant predictor of engagement in group activities after leaving school, interactions with friends, and having an employment history; whereas having a transition plan before leaving school was a significant predictor of participation in group activities, interaction with friends, engagement in post secondary education, and employment history.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to examine the differences in self-perception of social competence in high school students with learning disabilities in self-contained and inclusive settings. Using Harter's self-competence scale for adolescents (SPPA) (Harter, 1980), students in both settings answered questions as to their perceptions of their own social competence. Results suggest that students in a self-contained setting have higher perceptions of social competence than those in an inclusive environment. The study further explored the relationship between students with learning disabilities self-reported responses and their teachers' (special education) responses. This shows that teachers of students with learning disabilities report the behaviors of their students with special needs accurately. The study surveyed 64 students with learning disabilities in grades nine through twelve at two high schools from a Midwestern county. Additional descriptive information is offered.

AB  - This study was a follow-up of a group of 29 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders at age 2 who attended an inclusive toddler program until age 3. Children ranged in age from 4 to 12 years at the time of the parent survey and follow-up testing. The majority of children were placed in a special education (noninclusive) preschool class, but among the children who were in elementary school at the time of follow-up, 63% were in general education classroom placement. Diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders remained stable, socialization skills remained a weakness, and child-related parental stress remained high despite average cognitive and language skills in the majority of children. Social skill development and support remained a service need.

AB  - This study, conducted in one Southern California district, had two complementary purposes. One was to obtain from special education teachers and regular education teachers who work in collaboration with their special education colleagues their perceptions of how the NCLB policies and practices may have affected the learning and academic performance of special education students across this period. The second was to examine actual student performance, using California test data to examine absolute year-by-year changes in mathematics and English language arts test scores of special education students during the past decade corresponding to the beginning period of NCLB/IDEA launch. Teachers (N = 72) completed a 35-item survey about their perceptions on the effect of NCLB on special education and five scales were developed from a factor analysis of their responses. In a within-subject comparison, the teachers rated 'increased attention to quality of instruction' lowest of scales and 'increased mainstreaming and attention to test scores' as the highest. In comparison of special education teachers with those who were not, the special education teachers perceived significantly less emphasis on mainstreaming and test scores. California standardized test scores for the year 2003 to 2010 were also analyzed for trends in achievement of special education versus general education students. The results for English language arts show that the mean difference in scores of special education and regular education students to be relatively constant across the eight-year period. While the mathematics result of special education students show a slight improvement, while that of regular education students declined; thereby accounting for what appeared to be a narrowing of achievement gap between special education and general education students in mathematics.

AB  - Abstract: This study was carried out to determine the impact that both segregation and inclusive education at the Basic Level have on children with low vision in Ghana. In all, 54 participants were involved in the study. The instruments used in the collection of data for this study were a semi-structured interview schedule and a questionnaire. Both interview and questionnaire items were based on, academic performance, orientation and mobility, activities of daily living, social interaction and the challenges and prospects of the two programmes. The results showed that visually impaired children from both programmes have problems with movement initially but overcome it after a year. Socially, children from inclusive programmes better participated in family and community activities than their counterparts in the special school. There was no significant difference in the academic performance of children from the two programmes. The two programmes have challenges but the prospects of inclusive education looks brighter. There is a balance in terms of academic performance and socialization.

AB  - Background: Speechlanguage interventions are often complex in nature, involving multiple observations, variable outcomes and individualization in treatment delivery. The accepted procedure associated with randomized controlled trials (RCT) of such complex interventions is to develop and implement a manual of intervention in order that reliable treatment delivery can be achieved. Aims: To present the rationale, structure and content of an intensive manualized intervention as implemented within an RCT for children with complex pragmatic and social communication needs; to investigate factors associated with implementation in a mainstream school environment; and to determine treatment fidelity. Methods & Procedures: The manualized SCIP intervention, including procedures for developing individualized treatment plans, was developed and then implemented within an RCT with 57 school-aged children with complex pragmatic communication needs (CwPLI). The paper describes the delivery protocol, staffing requirements, and content and structure of the intervention. A mapping procedure for individualization of intervention and the implemented components of intervention are presented. The findings from a school-therapy alliance checklist for recording factors affecting implementation in a school context are also reported. Treatment fidelity was carried out using measures of delivered versus planned treatment content and quality of therapy. Outcomes & Results: The manual was effective at detailing intervention procedures and allowing for development of individualized treatment plans whilst maintaining satisfactory treatment fidelity. Treatment planning and delivery required continuous specialist speech and language therapist input with assistants needing substantive training and supervision. Key components of intervention for CwPLI were therapies aimed at improving conversation skills, narrative construction, comprehension monitoring, understanding of social cues and metapragmatic awareness. The school-therapy alliance checklist indicated high rates of therapist-education staff and therapist-parent liaison. Parents were nearly always involved in treatment planning though only half-attended therapy sessions. Learning support provision in schools for participating children was highly variable. Conclusions & Implications: Predetermining theoretical background, structure, and content in a treatment manual contributed towards the quality and reliability of intervention within the context of an RCT. The implementation of SCIP intervention in a broader clinical context is discussed with reference to staff expertise, the therapeutic process and the essential ingredients of social communication intervention.

AB  - Education has trailed both the business and scientific fields in the use of predictive data-mining to inform decision making. This causal-comparative study examined the provision of special education and related services to students with disabilities to determine how those service combinations come together in patterns to predict proficiency on high-stakes tests of reading and mathematics. The study sample included 1771 students with disabilities enrolled in grades 3-8 who (a) received one special education service as reported to the State's Special Services Information System (SSIS) in October 2007 and (b) took the State School Assessment (SSA) in reading and mathematics during the 2006-2007 school year. Data-mining, an iterative process which uncovers hidden patterns between and among variables, was used to predict the reading and mathematics proficiency of participants within the following subcategories: students with any disability, students with any disability enrolled in elementary or middle school, students with specific learning disability, students with speech or language impairment, and students with other health impairments. Results indicated that data mining could reveal service patterns and combinations that predicted student proficiency on high-stakes tests of reading and mathematics. For students with any disability, mathematics proficiency was predicted by the provision of special education instruction while reading proficiency was predicted by the provision of a combination of special education instruction and speech language therapy. Students with either a specific learning disability or speech or language impairment were proficient in reading when provided with special education instruction, while students with other health impairment were proficient when provided with modest amounts of speech language therapy. For mathematics proficiency, all three disability groups were proficient when provided with higher amounts of special education instruction. Across all disability groups, poor performance in both reading and mathematics was predicted by lower amounts of special education instruction. To further pinpoint service intensity within the identified service patterns, post hoc analyses were conducted examining the reading and mathematics proficiency of students with any disability who (a) received special education instruction, (b) received speech language therapy, and (c) received both special education instruction and speech language therapy. The implications of the findings and the themes emerging from the investigation are discussed, recommendations for practice are presented, and areas for future research are suggested.

AB  - ABSTRACTParents, professionals, and researchers have been concerned about the most appropriate placement for children with mental retardation. To shed light on the efficacy of integration, 36 studies were reviewed on the academic and social attainments of school-age children with mental retardation. Results show that children in general education classes do not attain social acceptance ratings at as high a level as do their typically developing peers. When comparing children with mental retardation in general education and special education classrooms, integrated students perform better than their comparable segregated students on measures of academic achievement and social competence. Other variables are discussed that might affect child outcomes, and related recommendations are given for future research.

AB  - The academic achievement of diverse kindergarten to grade 12 students in inclusive classrooms implementing the Three-Block Model (TBM) of universal design for learning was investigated. Fifty-one teachers and 684 of their students, including students with disabilities, students who were English language learners (ELL), and Indigenous students, participated in treatment and control groups. Results indicated significant differences between the two groups on measures of academic achievement, as reflected in a rubric that assessed levels of critical thinking. This was the case for typically developing students as well as those in the three subgroups, with large effect sizes in all cases. These findings suggest that the combination of social and emotional programming with universally designed instruction holds promise for improving the academic achievement of a broad spectrum of learners. Results are discussed in regards to implementation and training needs, and recommendations are made for future research.

AB  - Compared academic progress over 5 yrs for students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) and students with learning disabilities (LD). Additionally, several factors (attendance, behavior offenses, type of special education setting, school mobility, and early retention) were examined as to their contribution to achievement over time for these 2 groups of students. Ss were 42 students with EBD and 61 students with LD. Academic achievement was represented by standardized math and reading test scores at 2 points: kindergarten or 1st grade and 5th or 6th grade. Results show that students with LD made significant progress over time in reading, and this progress was associated with less time receiving full-time special education services. Similar findings were not found for students with EBD. For both groups, early retention was associated with lower achievement over time. There was no association between type of education setting and academic progress for EBD students. There was no significant relationship between attendance, behavior offenses or school mobility and academic progress over time for either group. It is concluded that these results suggest the ineffectiveness of using retention as an intervention for academic deficits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

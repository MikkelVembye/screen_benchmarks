AB  - While there are hundreds of studies reported for general education, few researchers have focused on the impact of class size on the academic achievement of students with special needs. Despite escalating special education costs and increasing student needs, policies governing special education remain inconsistent. We examine the effect of class size reduction on special education students. Two issues were explored: (a) appropriate class size and caseload as they influence special education student academic achievement and (b) the effect of class size on special education teacher attrition rate and teaching methods. The implications of these issues for policy makers are also discussed. Findings indicate 1) each state has different rules on class size and caseload for special education, 2) the students demonstrating the most profound needs remain largely unaffected by class size reduction, and 3) that attrition rate is affected more by quality of teacher preparation than it is by class size. Teachers felt inadequately prepared for inclusion and indicated that their primary need was for more specific inclusion training. We identified no single best way to determine appropriate class and group size for special instructional programs and services; however, the existence of well-qualified teachers proved an important factor in increasing student achievement.

AB  - Case study analyses of nine mildly handicapped elementary students were conducted to identify factors related to gains in achievement and to higher active academic responding times (ART) in relation to different student-teacher ratios. Six learning disabled and three educable mentally retarded students (grades 3-5) were observed in special education settings under different student-teacher ratios. Information was collected on each student in the areas of aptitude, achievement gains during a one-year period, behavior, the nature of home, school, and community learning environments, methods of instruction, and the student's academic engaged time (and other times) under different student-teacher ratios. Results indicated considerable inter-individual and intra-individual variability in all factors examined, but few consistent trends. Among conclusions discussed is that ART changes in relation to several variables, particularly the content area of instruction, the nature of the task, and environmental distractions. The data also seemed to indicate that the special education categorical label assigned to a student does not determine the effectiveness of different student-teacher ratios. Results suggested that ART is higher when the method of instruction is some form of direct instruction. (JW)

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative correlational research was to study the relationship between class size and students' academic achievement. Citywide language arts and math test scores for third and fifth grade students in four New York City public schools were examined using a variety of variables including (a) gender, (b) ethnicity, (c) grade level, (d) teacher experience, (e) classroom type (i.e., special education, inclusion/collaborative Team Teaching (CTT), gifted, or general), and (f) dollar amount spent for each student each year to determine if these variables played a significant role in the study. Conducting a partial correlation analysis, Zero Order Correlation Coefficients, Regression Coefficients, and Regression Analysis to test the hypotheses and to answer the research questions revealed that class size has no relationship to students' academic achievement. Conducting a regression analysis of class type demonstrated a class of 23 had a relationship to students' test scores, as the test scores were higher than the test scores of students in other classes. Female students performed better than male students in language arts and mathematics. Male Black students scored lower than any other ethnic group in language arts and mathematics. Teacher experience had an impact on students' performance in language arts and mathematics in grades 3 and 5. The results of the study indicated a need for further research including a longitudinal study using other variables to generalize whether class size has a relationship to students' academic achievement.

AB  - When California implemented its class-size reduction (CSR) program in 1996, a number of questions regarding financial burdens, teacher shortages, scarcity of facilities, and collective bargaining were raised. This first-year implementation study aims to provide some contextual information as background for answering questions, to clarify these issues and to provide a more comprehensive, long-term evaluation of CSR, contextual information. In section 1, the introduction examines the status of the class-size reduction initiative and discusses what the research says. Section 2 provides the study design and then describes the major findings, focusing on the effects on special populations, on staff development, on classroom practices, on parent involvement, and on implementation challenges. Section 3 contains detailed coverage of findings in these same areas of focus. Section 4 provides an overview of policy and research implications of CSR. The emphasis throughout the report is on the perceptions of school-level educators, so as to provide evidence of how CSR unfolded in particular schools across California in its first year of implementation. Findings show that district officials, teachers, principals, and coordinators generally believe that CSR will lead to high student achievement. Some specific areas of CSR that warrant more careful evaluation are provided. (Contains 36 endnotes and 51 references.) (RJM)

AB  - The Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004) and the No Child Left Behind Act (2002) focused districts on early intervention in order to assist struggling students as soon as they entered school to accelerate learning and success. A three-tiered model is used in most districts involving three tiers of intervention. Tier 1 lays the foundation of quality, rich instruction with scaffolding and differentiation. Tier 2 is targeted to specific needs and is delivered in small groups. Tier 3 is intensified by lowering the group size and adding intervention time. Through these tiers interventions occur to target students' needs. Students may be served for a single year or multiple years depending on need and sustainability of progress. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of Response to Intervention on students entering kindergarten during the 2007–2008 school year. This study longitudinally examined if the intervention for students who entered RTI in kindergarten and exited at the end of kindergarten sustained success over time using the 2010–2011 TAKS test scores from third grade. The study investigated if students who entered RTI in kindergarten and remained in intervention for any of their schooling in kindergarten, first, second, and/or third grade sustained success over time using the 2010–2011 TAKS test scores. A mixed methods study was used to gauge the perceived success of the RTI program. A focus group of randomly selected reading specialists was conducted by the researcher. The focus group concentrated on how participants felt about the success of the program based on their experience. This study also utilized archival data obtained from the 2010–2011 TAKS assessment in reading. This study found that early intervention brings the most success in students longitudinally. The statistically significant difference was in only one year of service occurring the first year. The number of students served decreased each year with the passing rate by third grade being 90.08% and commended rate 33.59%. The focus group findings confirmed results including necessary early intervention for success. Coaching and small group instruction was prominent in the discussion concentrating on student success. RTI supports struggling students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article reports on a multi-method study of the ways in which special and mainstream schools support the educational needs of children with disabilities in Fiji. The aims of the study were: (1) to identify capacity and functions of special schools to support inclusive mainstream schools for children with disabilities; and (2) to explore the capacity of mainstream disability-inclusive schools in meeting the needs of children with disabilities. Results from the special education survey indicated that type of disability, geographic location and controlling authority were associated with transition to mainstream education. Findings from the action research study suggest that supportive school leadership and positive attitudes towards disability and inclusion contribute to greater mobilisation of supporting resources. However, limitations in facilities and resources currently pose barriers which prevent inclusion for all students with disabilities. Together, these findings indicate that special and inclusive mainstream schools jointly support disability-inclusive education in Fiji.

AB  - There have been vast changes in relation to the way educational teaching support provision is organised for pupils with dyslexia in Ireland. A qualitative research approach was utilised to examine the impact and implications of the General Allocation Model (GAM) regarding the organisation of support for pupils with dyslexia in Irish Primary mainstream schools. At the time of the research, GAM was the model of resourcing which allowed autonomy at school level in terms of organising support for pupils with dyslexia. Since then, a new model of resourcing [Department of Education and Skills (DES). (2017). "SP ED 13.17: Circular to the Management Authorities of all Mainstream Primary Schools Special Education Teaching Allocation." Dublin: Stationery Office] has been implemented which also generates autonomy at school level albeit using a different allocation process. This paper raises concerns that the needs of pupils with dyslexia were not always met by the GAM model. Issues around the effectiveness of whole school approaches, the intensity of support for pupils with severe dyslexia, group size for this support, the application of differentiated approaches, and teacher expertise may have implications for how the new model for allocating resources is organised in schools. In conclusion, it is proposed that schools require further guidance and support in operationalising resourcing models to effectively meet the needs of pupils with dyslexia.

Subjects were 139 mainstreamed elementary students (grades 1-6), most of whom were categorically labeled as learning disabled (n=114). Students were observed during their special education time, within student-teacher ratios that varied from less than 1:1 (one student with two teachers) to over 15:1. Using grouped ratios represented by 1:1, 3:1, 6:1, 9:1, and 12:1, students' academic engaged time, task completion, and task success, as well as the qualitative nature of their instruction were compared. Targeted student behaviors were recorded by trained observers using rating scales and observational instruments. Data from structured interviews with students and teachers were also used. Significant differences were found in measures of both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of instruction, with nearly all favoring the lower student-teacher ratios. Lack of observed differences in task completion and task success rates (which were very high for all students in all student-teacher ratio groupings) was attributed to task content during special education instructional time.

AB  - A survey of itinerant teachers of the deaf and hard of hearing in four Australian states was con-ducted to describe the personal and professional characteristics of these teachers and their work with students. Of particular interest was whether itinerant teachers use consultative or pull-out models of service delivery. Other elements surveyed included professional training and backgrounds of the teachers, their experience in regular and special education, the basis of their workload determination, the roles they adopt to meet the perceived needs of their students, and factors which influenced their perceptions of the effectiveness of service delivery. The implications of these findings for policy development and service delivery are discussed.

AB  - This research explored the behaviour of pupils with emotional and behavioural difficulties and the factors and processes that these pupils perceived as having in some way influenced their behaviour and their subsequent placement in special education. 36 pupils (aged 12–16) were interviewed. Results indicate that the pupils' disruptive and disaffected behaviour can result from any one or a combination of the following school-related factors: (1) schools being too large, impersonal and institutionalized; (2) classes being too large and teacher/pupil ratios being too high; and 'bad' teaching, involving inconsistency, unfairness, lack of control, aggressive and authoritarian methods of discipline, lack of academic and/or personal support in meeting individual needs, and impersonal relationships. Other factors included the curriculum being irrelevant or too challenging, and social difficulties, such as bullying, coupled with inadequate support and understanding from schools and teachers when dealing with this issue.

AB  - Examined perceptions of teachers who were not presently participating in inclusion models, using focused group interviews. Ss were 26 special education teachers, 25 education teachers, 8 Chapter 1 teachers, and 15 teachers of the gifted. Ss were asked the about their knowledge of inclusion, possible facilitators or barriers to an inclusion model, their ideal model for inclusion, and questions researchers should ask when examining the effects of inclusion models. Results show that most Ss had strong, negative feelings about inclusion and felt that decision makers were out of touch with classroom realities. Ss identified several factors that would affect the success of inclusion, including class size, inadequate resources, the extent to which all students would benefit from inclusion, and lack of adequate teacher preparation.

AB  - Nationally in the US, approximately six million students receive special education services with about 50% qualifying for LD services. Of this 50%, about 80%-90% qualify with a specific learning disability in reading. This study examined evidence on the pattern of LD placements in six districts, before and after those districts implemented an early systemic intervention (Reading Recovery) designed to support the literacy learning of the most at-risk first grade students. Differences in LD patterns were further examined in relation to district policy and procedures that may account for variation in LD placements and the apparent effectiveness of early intervention and broader systemic change efforts in reducing the need for LD services. The study used a mixed methodology employing a retrospective follow back design. The sample of all LD students aged 9-, 10-, and 11-years-old (N=484) was collected from special education records in 1996-97 and 2001-02 in six school districts who had Reading Recovery fully implemented since 1996-97. The data analyses revealed significant differences in the frequency of LD placement before and after the interventions in two of the six districts. There were no statistical differences in the frequency of LD subtypes before and after the interventions. The percentage of the Reading Recovery cadre still in general education 3-5 years after the intervention ranged from 62% to 93% across the six districts. Two case study districts were selected to examine the relationship between policy and procedures that may impact who receives LD services in special education. Three factors emerged as themes: teacher efficacy, the culture of special education, and the practice of weighting special education students to reduce general education class sizes.

AB  - Historically, adolescents with learning disabilities have struggled with the expected level of academic rigor at the secondary level, resulting in higher dropout rates and poorer postschool options than their nondisabled peers. Developing appropriate special education supports and interventions is vital to changing this result. The research problem examined in this study centered on the effectiveness of a multitiered set of special education services and interventions for the academic progress of ninth-grade students with learning disabilities. The multitiered model presented in this research is based on the premise that more layers of special education support, increased levels of intervention, smaller group size, and increased frequency of service produce greater gains in student achievement in English/language arts. In a multitiered model, students with learning disabilities received multiple levels of intervention combined with layered special education services. The tiers consisted of Tier 1, general education English class; Tier 2, general education intervention program (two periods) or general education English class and one period of special education (learning center); or Tier 3, special education content instruction with one additional period of intervention instruction. Layers of special education support consisted of coplanning, coteaching, direct instruction-nonintensive, and direct instruction-intensive. Using a value-added analysis, the pre- and postintervention results of the state required tests were compared to determine growth in English. In addition, classroom observations using the Classroom Climate Scale as an observational protocol were conducted to determine the extent of the provision of accommodations within the general education classroom. It was predicted that students in Tier 3 would demonstrate the greatest gains, although the results indicated that students in Tier 1 made the highest academic gains in English. Classroom observations demonstrated the importance of effective coplanning and coteaching based on student need. Although the results may not have fully validated the model, it appears to have generated enough questions about the potential benefits of a multitiered method for providing services and intervention to secondary students with learning disabilities to warrant further exploration.

AB  - Objective: This quasi‐experimental study reported the results of a structured literacy intervention programme designed for secondary school students of Year 7 to Year 9 with dyslexia. Students of the intervention group (n = 116) participated in 40‐week sessions of small‐size, classroom‐based, and split‐group intervention setting with 45‐min daily lesson on both Chinese and English language compared with students in the control group who received normal classroom instructions (n = 98). Results: Students in the intervention group outperformed the control groups in self‐regulated learning scales, which indicated that there was positive change in students' behavioural and cognitive outcomes in learning. Although students demonstrated gains in phonetic skills, posttest results in academic achievement did not exhibit significant improvement when compared with their control group peers. Conclusion: The findings provided some encouraging evidence of the effectiveness of intervention programme. Students that demonstrated gains in phonetic skills and improvement in behavioural and cognitive aspects required continuous intervention lessons to become a self‐regulated learner, who would be self‐motivated to improve methods of learning and adopt strategies for attaining academic goals. The study contributed to the literature by presenting one of the very first school‐based, small‐size, classroom‐based, and split‐group intervention programme for secondary school dyslexic students, which included teachers and students training on English and Chinese intervention content (phonological and literacy content), teaching curriculum integrated with school curriculum, and coteaching with school teachers in the mainstream classrooms, whereas most of the existing intervention programmes used pull‐out approach involving the first language only.

AB  - This study reports on the perceptions and instructional practices of Grades 3 through 5 special education teachers in a school district that implemented a multitiered response to intervention (RTI) framework for the previous 5 years. The authors used focus groups and interviews to examine special education teachers’ perceptions of RTI. In addition, the authors observed the mathematics and reading instruction that these teachers provided. This study contributes to the literature by presenting a qualitative, in-depth description of special education teachers’ perceptions related to RTI implementation at the upper elementary level.

AB  - On the basis of a microeconometric examination of Philadelphia School District data, it is concluded that (1) many school inputs do matter, (2) disadvantaged students can be helped by particular types of inputs, and (3) these optimistic results are accounted for by the use of pupil-specific data, and appropriate statistical data. The school inputs examined include teacher quality and school quality (e.g., class size). Peer group effects are discussed. Genetic and socioeconomic inputs of the students are examined. The importance of examining school inputs differentially is established by a comparison of the results with and without interaction analysis. The importance of using disaggregated data is emphasized by a comparison of the results when pupil-specific data for school inputs are used with the results when school averages are used. (Author/MC)

AB  - Using a stimulated recall procedure, this study examined the reflections of identified "expert" special educators who were working in a variety of instructional settings with differing student populations. Participants were 13 special education teachers from urban, mid-size, and rural school districts. Special education supervisors were asked to nominate teachers who had at least five years of teaching experience, were recognized as being effective teachers, instructed students that generally made excellent progress, and were generally viewed as superior special education teachers. Teachers were interviewed about their classroom experiences and teaching philosophy and then viewed videotapes of their instruction to stimulate thoughts and decisions that were occurring during the instructional episode. Findings from the study indicate the stimulated recall procedures successfully prompted teachers to readily and prolifically express their thoughts and emotions concerning targeted teaching sequences. Many times teachers did not restrict their comments to the episode that they observed on the videotape, but expanded on how they made instructional decisions, describing previous events had influenced their decision-making. Teachers used instructional diagnosis and frequently consulted regular education teachers to teach students with special needs. The use of the stimulated recall procedure for transferring expertise is discussed. (Contains 27 references.) (CR)

AB  - We exploit differences in state special education funding systems based on special education enrollment (‘bounty systems’) or on total student enrollment (‘census systems’) to assess whether funding systems impact teacher turnover, teacher specialty, special education enrollment, state education spending, average class sizes, and teacher effort. We find that census funding decreases special education enrollment and increases turnover among special education teachers. Relative to their counterparts, special education teachers are 5 percentage points more likely to move across schools and 18 percentage points more likely to switch to general education teaching after the implementation of census funding in their state.

AB  - Researchers have highlighted engagement as a critical component of effective interventions for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), yet there is limited research related to engagement in school-age children with ASD. This descriptive study was designed to examine joint engagement and its relationship with classroom factors and student characteristics. The sample included 25 elementary and middle school students with ASD. Mixed level modeling was used to examine relationships between joint engagement and classroom factors and student characteristics. Joint engagement was significantly related to group size, use of student-directed practices, autism severity, and expressive communication skills. These findings have important implications for educational policies and practices and future research related to engagement and effective interventions for students with ASD.

AB  - This report discusses the results of the third year--1998-99--of California's Class Size Reduction (CSR) program. Assessments of the program show that CSR was almost fully implemented by 1998-99, with over 92 percent of students in K-3 in classes of 20 or fewer students. Those K-3 classes that had not been reduced in size were concentrated in districts serving high percentages of minority, low-income, or English-learner (EL) students. The average qualifications of California teachers declined for all grade levels, but the declines were worse in elementary schools. Although the qualifications of K-3 teachers continued to decline, it was at a slower rate than in the past. Declines in teacher qualifications were mirrored in grades 4 and 5. Curriculum and instruction were mostly similar regardless of class size, though teachers in reduced-size classes spent more time working individually with students during mathematics and language arts lessons than did their counterparts in nonreduced-size classes. Student achievement did improve in the reduced-size classes, and these positive gains were evident with all students, regardless of their backgrounds. These positive effects continued in grade 4 and regular-size classes. Finally, programs serving EL students and special-education students were affected by the transfer of teachers from these areas into regular classes. (RJM)

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine, within an integrative predictive model, the relative contributions of sociodemographic variables, personal resources, and work wellbeing to teacher burnout. The research was conducted with special education teachers at Italian preschools-a context in which few previous studies have been carried out-and primary schools. A cross-sectional survey-based study with a sample of 194 kindergarten and primary school teachers was conducted. The results indicated that teachers' happiness at school and job satisfaction incrementally predicted variance in personal, work-related, and student-related burnout, even after controlling for the effects of sociodemographic factors and personal resources. Furthermore, the final integrative predictive model was similar for both kindergarten and primary teachers.

In this article case studies of two children who demonstrated significant and sustained lack of adequate response to treatment are profiled. Results indicated that reducing group size, using formative assessment, and implementing mastery learning criteria produced positive trends on indicators of oral reading fluency. Students' reading outcomes provide evidence of the importance of timely data-based instructional adjustments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compared the amount of instructional time available in 5 classrooms for severely/multiply handicapped children (aged 6–16 yrs) when student–staff ratios ranged from 10:3 to 5:3. Systematic observations of staff activities were made for 1 full school day (5 hrs) in classes with 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 students, 1 special education teacher, and 2 developmental assistants. Results suggest a turning point at which instructional and noninstructional (or caretaking) time is approximately equal, at a 2:1 student–staff ratio. Thereafter, the gains in instructional time may become less pronounced. (15 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study assessed which factors early childhood regular education classroom teachers, grades kindergarten through third, perceive as promoting or hindering the successful practice of inclusion. Three research questions formed the basis of this study: (1) How do early childhood classroom teachers (K-3) describe their perceptions of inclusion? (2) How do they describe their perceptions of successful inclusion? and (3) How do they describe their perceptions of unsuccessful inclusion? Six teachers were randomly selected from survey respondents to participate in four interviews. Findings showed that the teachers all shared the same basic beliefs regarding the importance of inclusion. Teachers' comments regarding successful versus unsuccessful inclusion revealed four themes: training, class load, support, and time. Recommendations drawn from the study include the following: (1) keep class size to a reasonable number; (2) keep case loads of resource personnel reasonable; (3) provide each regular education classroom with a consistent paraprofessional assigned for no less than half a day; (4) do not expect regular education teachers to deliver the instruction alone; (5) provide time for planning and collaboration; (6) keep inservice training practical and relevant; (7) advise and evaluate new para-educators at the time of hiring regarding new tasks that come with inclusion; (8) provide comprehensive training; (9) have administrators spend time teaching in an inclusive classroom; (10) provide for evaluation; and (11) provide a mediator for teachers.

AB  - This case study was intended to explore the premise that the perceptions of the stakeholders regarding inclusion should enhance the implementation of the process in a K-12 rural setting. Therefore, rural high school students' and rural general education and special education teachers' perceptions of inclusion provided the primary focus of this case study. Data analysis identified that while overall general education teachers supported the idea of inclusion they did not believe that they were trained. Additionally, the students supported the concept of inclusion when they were allowed choice in which classroom they were placed and if the teacher allowed choice in classroom activities. Also the classroom size was identified by all stakeholders as an issue by being affected negatively by the addition of more students being placed in inclusive classrooms. Implications for the teacher training, and the allocation of resources in rural settings are significant. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - In order to document the effects of including secondary students with severe disabilities in rural middle and high schools, a study was conducted in one senior high school and one middle school in Washington School District, Utah. The schools had a total of 8 students with severe disabilities. Specifically, the study examined the beliefs of secondary educators about including students with moderate or severe disabilities in secondary schools and content area classrooms; how instructional practices are impacted when students with severe disabilities are included; and what educators have learned about including students with severe disabilities. Twenty educators were interviewed at the beginning and end of the school year to determine attitudes about inclusion, impact on students, effects on teaching practice, and needed supports. The educators felt that inclusion was the right thing to do and was working; class size and group focus was a challenge; support was needed from special education staff; both disabled and nondisabled students benefited from inclusion; specific teaching strategies had been developed, but grading and individual educational programs were a concern; and training and technical assistance were needed. The findings suggest that rural secondary educators are willing to include students with severe disabilities in content area classrooms, but that more research is needed to identify appropriate learning strategies.

AB  - The report released by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that approximately 1 in 68 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children with autism do not form meaningful social relationships and have trouble interacting with peers. For this reason, those individuals need help to develop appropriate social skills. These shortfalls can lead to problems such as social exclusion, challenging behavior, bullying, academic challenges, depression or other physical or mental health problems, and even suicidal ideation. There are several social intervention strategies that make an effort to increase the social skills and social interaction of children with autism. The primary purpose of this qualitative case study was to explore and understand the effectiveness of the strategies of social skills interventions that are used in the self-contained ASD classrooms at one large urban district in Florida and to provide the resulting best practices to all teachers. The case study investigated how the methods of social intervention strategies like role-playing, social stories, video modeling or collaboration with peers influence social interactions skills in children with autism and impact social skills instruction. Data was collected from special education state-certified public-school teachers that teach students with autism in the self-contained classroom. The focus of this study was to research effective interventions that are used by teachers in the classroom for children on the spectrum of autism for the best training and development of social skills instructions. Three research questions were set up to attempt to answer the principal question, What social intervention strategies do ASD teachers use in the self-contained classroom and how effective are those strategies in practice? Despite the limitation of the study, the results were significant and will add to the body of knowledge. Recommendations were made for future research to (a) to provide all teachers with evidence-based practice intervention training and specific curriculum to teach, monitor and evaluate the outcome of the practice; (b) increase sample size; and (c) examine the role of the accuracy of the social interaction strategies in classroom setting over time to determine changes in the targeted behavior.

AB  - The author suggests ways in which the field of special education, specifically for mildly handicapped students, must reexamine its role and functions in light of budget cuts and threats of deregulation. He asserts that mainstreaming efforts must be reevaluated to assure that special education remains a part of general education in the community. Effects of increased class size and fiscal constraints on teachers' reluctance to accommodate differences in the classroom are noted. It is also suggested that regular classroom teachers need support in adapting curricula, technology, and presentation style. The importance of including the mildly learning disabled student in integrated rather than isolated school experiences is emphasized. (CL)

AB  - This report presents an analysis of the statistics concerning the status of education for students with special needs in member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Special needs students are defined as those who have disabilities with clear biological causes, or who are experiencing learning difficulties, or who have difficulties arising from disadvantages. Following an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 reports on the development of the data collection instrument, a questionnaire. Chapter 3 discusses the qualitative data analysis conducted, including data on the use of categories of students and national educational legislation. Chapter 4 presents a comparative analysis of quantitative data based on national categories of disabilities. Chapter 5 offers analysis of the quantitative data broken down into the three cross-national categories of special needs students. This is followed by a chapter providing additional analyses of the quantitative data, which includes special schools and classes, regular classes, and student/staff ratios. The final chapter offers discussion and conclusions, noting the lack of consistency in terminology used by different countries, implications of the resources model, and a consistent gender effect with more males receiving special education services across all three categories. Five annexes include additional data tables, the questionnaire used, and definitions of educational levels. (Author/DB)

AB  - As important decisions are being made with regard to educational legislation, policy and provision for children with special educational needs (SEN), it is critical that the views of these key stakeholders are heard and considered. This article reports the perspectives of 38 children and young people with special educational needs on their schooling which formed part of a national review of the role of special schools and special classes in Ireland. Findings from the focus groups and individual interviews point to more favourable support for learning and social issues in special schools and special classes than in mainstream classes. Friendship is a recurrent theme in students' accounts and appears to mediate their enjoyment of school. The implications are considered with reference to research, policy and practice and the authors conclude that educators and policy makers should provide increased opportunities for students to play an active part in matters affecting them.

AB  - Children with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) are failing academically, despite the availability of educational, financial, and medical resources for them. This could be explained by the reliance of educational processes on traditional direct instruction that leads to poor academic performance of students with AS. Classroom format and environment are said to affect student performance, particularly students with autism spectrum disorders. The current study was designed to look at whether students with AS achieve better in (a) mainstreamed, (b) inclusive, or (c) self-contained classes using the self-efficacy and optimal stimulus theories as frameworks. A quantitative method was the main research approach to answer these questions. Survey research data was collected to (a) identify which classroom format produces the highest academic achievement for students with AS, and (b) identify specific factors, such as classroom size and time of day, that support academic achievement in mainstreaming, inclusive, and self-contained formats. Classroom teachers who were directly responsible for teaching students with AS were asked to participate in answering the surveys. Administrators with oversight responsibility were also asked to participate in the survey questions. The study was significant, because the findings may help in improving the educational outcomes of students with AS. The results of the data analysis showed that there was a statistically significant difference in test scores based on the type of classroom in which the students received instruction. In addition, students who received instruction in mainstream classroom had significantly higher test scores than the students who received instruction in the inclusive and self-contained classrooms. Furthermore, students who received instruction in the mainstream classrooms did not have mean test scores that were iii significantly different from the standard score. In contrast, the students who received instruction in the inclusive classrooms and the self-contained classrooms had mean test scores that were significantly lower than the standard score for the test. The important implication of those results is the traditional view that inclusive classrooms are better than other classroom formats for students with Asperger's syndrome is not correct.

AB  - Reviews the development in New Zealand of a class for the assessment of educable mentally retarded 5–7 yr old children. This class is intended to determine the most appropriate educational placements for 5 to 10 children while providing them with a stimulating environment in which to work. The need for such a class is discussed, and various facets of its operation—including equipment, staffing, transportation, and support services—are described. Advantages consist of early intervention, deferment in labeling, low staff–pupil ratio, and increased contact with parents. Difficulties encountered have been a shortage of suitably trained personnel, inadequate support services, and lack of objective evaluation. Downward and upward extensions of the assessment concept are expected, and it is predicted that assessment classes will become the main special education facility in New Zealand.

AB  - Inclusive educational settings have become the norm as schools aim to educate disabled students in environments least restrictive to their development (U.S. Department of Education, 2004). This study was conducted in order to assess teacher perceptions of inclusion academically, socially, and behaviorally for general and special education students. Informed by sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 1978), and integrated threat theory (Bustillos & Silvan-Ferrero, 2013), this research aimed to give voice to those most instrumental in implementing inclusion successfully and effectively. Utilizing open-ended interviews and qualitative analyses coded by Excel and NVivo software, the study discovered that teacher participants perceived the main benefit of inclusion to be the provision of leadership training and sensitivity for general education students and feelings of acceptance amongst special education students. However, teachers reported that the negative impacts of inclusion include more frequent incidents of disruptive behavior causing distraction from learning as well as more stringent academic standards and increased instances of bullying for the special education students. Key suggestions provided by participants included a need for additional training for teachers on co-teaching methods and special education student sensitivity. The participants also reported the necessity of smaller class sizes and a desire to return to the traditional classroom environment. This study benefits the educational community by revealing the necessity of special-education training workshops and support personnel to ease the integration of inclusive classrooms for both students and teachers. Implementation of such policy changes will make the perceptions of educators tangible. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

AB  - THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAM FOR BRAIN-INJURED CHILDREN OF AVERAGE OR LOW AVERAGE INTELLECTUAL POTENTIAL. THE OBJECTIVES WERE--(1) TO COLLECT CLINICAL TUTORING TECHNIQUES BEING USED, (2) TO CLASSIFY CLINICAL TUTORIAL METHODS IN A FRAMEWORK USEFUL FOR DEVELOPING TECHNIQUES FOR GROUP TEACHING, (3) TO ADOPT CLINICAL TUTORIAL TECHNIQUES TO GROUP TEACHING, (4) TO DEVELOP A MODEL DEMONSTRATION CLASSROOM FOR EXPERIMENTING WITH AND TESTING THE ADOPTED CLINICAL TUTORIAL TECHNIQUES TO PROVIDE OBSERVATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEACHERS AND EDUCATION STUDENTS, AND (5) TO DEVELOP NEW HYPOTHESES FOR EXPERIMENTATION IN GROUP EDUCATION OF BRAIN-INJURED CHILDREN. IT WAS FOUND THAT GREAT CARE HAD TO BE EXERCISED IN THE SELECTION OF THE CHILDREN FOR THE CLASS TO KEEP THE RANGE OF LEARNING PROBLEMS AS NARROW AS POSSIBLE. THE SIZE OF THE CLASS MUST BE KEPT UNDER 10. BESIDES HAVING MOTIVATED AND SKILLED TEACHERS, THERE MUST BE PROFESSIONAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM--A PHYSICIAN, PHYSICAL THERAPIST, PSYCHOLOGIST, AND SOCIAL WORKER AS A MINIMUM. THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A FULL-TIME TEACHER'S ASSISTANT IN THE CLASSROOM, AND SELECTION CRITERIA FOR GROUPING BRAIN-INJURED CHILDREN SHOULD BE BASED MORE ON EDUCATIONAL BEHAVIOR THAN ON MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.

AB  - By studying the process by which disadvantaged and low-achieving high school students are assigned to classes and special programs, how and why disadvantaged students are placed in inappropriate programs can be understood. Reasons exist to question the assumption that students are assigned to programs rationally on the basis of information about abilities, performance, and interests. Ideal characteristics of scheduling processes were identified based on the literature, and compared with practices in four urban high schools. Multiple methods of data collection, including interviews, reviews of school records, and observations of events related to scheduling, were used. Findings from the four schools indicate the degree to which each conforms or deviates from the following ideals of assignment: (1) appropriate for ability level; (2) class size appropriate for the type of instruction; (3) courses that fill graduation and college admission or employment requirements; (4) times that students are likely to attend; (5) effective teachers; (6) course assignments made before the beginning of the term; and (7) programs match student interests and needs. Recommendations for improvement of the assignment process are made. Thirty-six figures illustrate the discussion. Three appendixes contain interview questions, the interview format, and a course change form. (SLD)

AB  - This one-page abstract summarizes results of a final report of a federally funded research project titled, "Research Integration Project: Analysis and Review of Research on Least Restrictive Environments for Handicapped Learners." The goal of the project was the review, analysis, and interpretation of research on the concept of "least restrictive environment." The paper defines the term and examines the legal and legislative background which is based on the assumption that removal from the regular classroom setting potentially abrogates a student's rights. Results of evaluation of various administrative arrangements indicate that differences between regular and self-contained special education classroom environments are not typically as large as differences in classroom characteristics such as curriculum, teacher-student ratio, and teacher qualifications. The project also reviewed those variables related to the design of instruction and the educational environment encompassing factors related to both academic achievement and social outcomes. It is concluded that the amount of time a student is integrated is but one variable which may, or may not, have an impact on student achievement and/or social growth. (DB)

AB  - The education of students with disabilities (SWD) has undergone some significant changes within the public education system since the enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). Special education legislation has historically focused on equal access for all students. Too much time has been spent on educational access and not on student outcomes. Recently, the IDEA coupled with the NCLB has focused national attention on improving academic achievement of every child across the nation. The pairing of IDEA and NCLB raises the expectations of all students, including those SWD. In order to capitalize on student achievement, greater attention must be paid to the improvement of classroom assessment. Formative assessment may be at the heart of changing student achievement and motivation as well as teachers' expectations of these students. When teachers utilize formative assessment effectively, all students learn better (Black & Wiliam, 1998a; Popham 2006; Stiggins, 2002). The purpose of this study was to investigate teacher's perceptions about the influence of formative assessment on fourth grade SWD reading gains and the students' actual gains in the skills of: letter/sound recognition and word identification, reading comprehension and overall reading composite. Four special education teachers from two elementary schools located in a large middle-class school district in Suffolk County, Long Island were invited to participate in this study. The teachers in the study taught in either the integrated co-teaching or special class setting. Each integrated co-teaching classroom had no more than twelve special education students and no more than a total class size of 26. The special class did not have more than 15 special education students. The students with disabilities scores that were utilized in this study were all in the fourth grade and had been classified with a through the Committee on Special Education. The data for this study were collected using semi-structured interviews during which the participants were asked open-ended questions. Additionally, data were collected from the results of the Kaufman Educational Achievement Test, specifically the reading subtests of letter/sound identification, word recognition and reading comprehension. A mixed methodology was used in this study. An analysis of the themes, patterns, and discrepancies noted from the interview protocol was triangulated with data generated from the pre and post test information from the Kaufman Educational Achievement Test. Results indicated that when both the qualitative and the quantitative data were triangulated the teachers' perceptions and the actual student gains in reading were closely associated. The teachers' perceptions of their students' achievement were positive when they used formative assessments to guide their students learning in reading. The teachers believed that most or all of their students would be positively impacted by the use of the information gained from these assessments. The actual gains supported this to be true as the data showed that in most cases, all or most of the students demonstrated gains in their reading in at least one of the areas assessed.

AB  - Four experimental groups and one control group were formed to determine, if possible, the optimum size of the special class for mentally retarded pupils under thirteen and one-half years of age. The period of the experiment was one hundred and eighty half days. The progress made in school subjects and in motor control was measured by Pressey's first grade reading test, the Stanford achievement test, the Ayres writing scale, and by a motor control test. The teachers' and principals' opinions were that twenty-five and thirty pupils are too many in one class. The results of the experiment show 'that on the average the class with an enrollment of twenty-five pupils made as much progress as those with an enrollment of fifteen, twenty, or twenty-two pupils.'

AB  - We describe educational experiences of people with disabilities who attended special schools in South Africa. We found significant differences in education between White and Black participants in terms of teaching quality, access to therapy and assistive devices, class sizes, subjects, and grades offered. Additional differences were noted between participants with congenital and early-onset disabilities, and those with degenerative or acquired disabilities who moved from a mainstream school to a special school. Thirty-six percent of participants in this study completed their education after Education White Paper 6 (EWP6), South Africa's inclusive education policy had been implemented. Despite this, findings suggest that all these participants experienced similar challenges as those who received their education during the apartheid era. This study highlights the important need to address the existing "special school" scenario, and effectively implement the principles of EWP6.

AB  - Background: Children with identified special educational needs are at higher risk than other children of having visual needs that are not adequately met. This paper evaluates the impact of addressing the visual needs of these children on behaviour and academic achievements in a number of case studies. Method: Nine children (4-11 years of age, from four classrooms), who attended a special school in a medium-sized town in the UK, took part in the case studies reported here. The children were part of the Special Education Eyecare (SEE) Project. Six of the children were selected because they had unmet visual needs at baseline and required bespoke interventions to meet these needs; the other three children were selected because their visual needs had been met prior to the study and no further adjustments were needed. Repeated direct observations were conducted to assess the impact of the intervention on the children's behaviour in the classroom. The observer was "blind" with regard to the visual needs of the participants. Parents and teachers completed the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for each child, before and after the intervention. School files were analysed to assess effects on academic achievement. Findings: Subsequent to the implementation of bespoke visual adjustments, for example prescription of spectacles or changed seating in classroom, significant and sustained changes were observed with regard to the children's behaviour (i.e., increased engagement with peers and/or teachers and decreased off-task behaviour). Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire scores showed improvements regarding total difficulties, emotional difficulties, hyperactivity and prosocial (kind and helpful) behaviour. Due to highly variable data in school files, the effects on academic achievement were inconclusive. Discussion: The case studies reported here explored changes in behaviour of children with identified special educational needs after their visual needs were met. Findings show a positive overall effect on the behaviour of these children.

AB  - This review has two parts: the first concerns class size and general education; the second, class size and special education. The general education review is in four sections: (1) foundational class size research; (2) critiques of the foundational works; (3) extended research; and (4) five studies in class size research conducted by states. The second part (on special education) reviews representative samples from an ERIC search of approximately 387 articles. These studies were: a national survey conducted by the University of Minnesota (1989) to document student to teacher ratios; also at the University of Minnesota (1993) an investigation of ratios of less than 15:1; a study conducted by the Virginia State Department of Education (1994) on special education program standards; another study in Virginia (1993) that investigated whether class size and class mix influenced educational outcomes; a New York State Education Department study to evaluate the impact of larger class size on those involved in the special education delivery system; and a study of individual caseloads. The review of these special education studies found that: (1) the maximum student to teacher ratio in special education is usually 15:1; (2) students are generally grouped by academic performance, not by their educational and management needs; (3) smaller classes provide better environments for learning, especially at the elementary level; (4) student achievement and behavior are affected by class size; (5) class size is impacted by other variables, including use of paraprofessionals and teacher experience; and (6) there is no one best teaching methodology to assure students success.

AB  - This publication presents the evaluation of the Secondary Special Education Initiative, a 5-year partnership between the New Jersey State Department of Education and nine school districts. The initiative was established in 1983 to enhance the development of high-school programs and services for educationally handicapped pupils. The initiative had as its goals the improvement of basic skills achievement in reading and mathematics, a decrease in the dropout rate for participating students, and an increase in post-graduation employment for participating students. In addition, each district agreed to be involved in collaborative planning, sharing, development, evaluation, and dissemination activities with the State Department of Education and with the other project districts. The report details the goals of the initiative, explains the collaborative roles of the department and project districts, describes individual project successes of five of the school districts, and identifies the strategies that enabled specific project districts to achieve one or more of its goals. Ten strategies that brought about goal achievement are presented, such as: student involvement in activities that simulate experiences of the work world; low pupil/teacher ratio; behavior and social improvement; and intensive individual, group, and family counseling. A directory of the nine school districts and contact persons is provided, as well as names and contact information for two resource persons for project assistance. (JDD)

AB  - Current research provides unique insights into the experiences and context of twice-exceptional students in K-12 schools. However, within this literature, a critical gap exists concerning the voices of twice-exceptional African American students and their families. The current qualitative study examined the perceptions, attitudes, and experiences of eight African American artistically gifted students with disabilities and three parents in a large, urban school district in the Midwest. Three major themes emerged from qualitative interviews: (a) the significance of labels, (b) social and personal experiences of exceptionality, and (c) challenges and strategies in the school environment. To this end, findings indicate that students experience their special education identity much differently from their gifted identity.

AB  - Students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD) are often placed into self- contained settings to provide more focused academic and behavioral supports. Little is known, however, about differences in the instructional contexts of self-contained and general education classrooms. Using direct observation and self-report measures, the present study investigated disparities in the practices used to support the academic and social achievement of students with and at risk for developing EBD across settings. Results indicated that teachers in self-contained settings were able to provide a greater amount of instruction in small-group settings. However, there were no differences found in the use of effective instructional strategies or practices. Findings are discussed within the context of the academic and behavioral needs of students within the sample.

AB  - Evidence-based practices (EBP) for children with autism are under-used in special-education schools. No research compared child-level versus teacher-level influences on EBP use, which could guide implementation strategies. We derived longitudinal profiles of EBP receipt by children (N = 234) in 69 autism-support classrooms, over an academic year. We compared overall impacts of child-level and teacher-level factors on profile membership. Most children received little EBP throughout the year; however substantial subgroups received increasing, and decreasing, doses of EBP. Child-level and teacher-level factors contributed about equally to profile membership. Children's autism symptoms and verbal ability, teachers' EBP skills, training/experience, classroom support, class size, and implementation leadership climate predicted profile membership. Early identification of treatment profiles could facilitate targeted implementation strategies increasing EBP use.

AB  - A 6-year field study project was undertaken to try out some patterns of special education with neurologically handicapped children. Three phases emphasized these objectives: feasibility, class size, pupil safety, approval, incidence, referral, diagnosis, placement, curriculum, treatment, evaluation, teacher qualifications, parent reactions, expansion, demonstration, and research. In phase 2, 116 neurologically impaired children were placed in either special (64) or regular (52) classes. The special class group generally contained older (1/2 year) and more severe cases; boys outnumbered girls 7 to 1. After a 3-year attendance in a special class, 12 students were recommended for return to regular class (out of 19) while 15 out of 19 children in the regular classes were felt to need special class placement. Steady attendance for 2 years was in favor of special class students (86% to 40.4%). Parents of children in special classes attended meetings concerning their children more frequently than parents of regular class children (52% to 7%). Special class students seemed favored in the few cases of academic comparison although the children were about 3 years academically retarded. Recommendations were made for future research. (RP)

AB  - There is a general acceptance that inclusion is morally and ethically the most appropriate form of education. However, more research needs to focus on how best to accommodate and support the educational needs of all students, including those with physical disabilities. Listening to young people with physical disabilities talk about their educational experiences is one way to do this. The aim of this research was to investigate the life stories of a small number of young people with physical disabilities, in particular focusing on their educational experiences. Nine young people, between the ages of 10 and 13 years, who used a manual or powered wheelchair and had the cognitive ability to participate in a series of biographical interviews, were recruited. They collaborated in the writing of their life stories. One theme identified in the analysis of these life stories was their educational experiences. The results highlight that the participants held mixed views about their education. The four who attended a segregated special school were generally positive about their experiences. Participants who had attended a mainstream school talked about positive and negative experiences. Individual and differing perspectives on friendships and the ethos of their school were noted. It is suggested that young people with physical disabilities need to be considered as individuals and that if schools are to achieve the goal of inclusion they need to develop ways to accommodate each individual's needs.

AB  - The purposes of the study were to modify the Pullis Inventory of Teacher Stress (PITS) for use in Taiwan and to investigate and compare the sources, effects, and coping strategies of occupational stress among the special school, special self-contained classroom, and regular classroom teachers in Taiwan. Procedures. Three groups of 10 special education teachers who were randomly selected from each population in Taiwan participated in the pilot study, whereas 60 special education teachers of the special school, 50 of the special self-contained classroom, and 40 of the regular classroom in formal study. Pilot Results. The range of reliabilities was from.7432 to.9531 for the whole inventory and its subscales. The validity was.7895 for the first and second parts of the inventory. Factor analysis yielded four factors--school factor, pupil characteristics, workload issues, and career issues. Formal Results. First, the formal study showed that there were significant differences regarding the sources and the effects of occupational stress among special education teachers of the special school, special self-contained class, and regular classroom. Next, there was no significant difference among the coping strategies used by special education teachers of the special school, special self-contained class, and regular classroom. Third, there was no overall relationship between the levels of the occupational stress and the time desired to stay in the profession by special education teachers, but the relationship was significant occurred in the special self-contained class teachers. The greater the level of occupational stress, the shorter the time they desired staying in their profession. Finally, the sources, effects, and coping strategies of the occupational stress could discriminate significantly among special education teachers of the special school, special self-contained class, and regular classroom. Recommendations. Further research studies with a larger sample or random sampling are recommended. Second, future studies might investigate more useful coping strategies provided by the school in addition to the personal strategies that were listed on the inventory. A qualitative approach, for example, interview, besides open-ended questions might be helpful for collecting such information. Third, due to the weak classification result in the current research study, a discriminant analysis with equal group sizes and dependent variables other than source, effect, and coping strategy, for example, gender, age, or teaching equipment and materials, is recommended if further research studies hope to focus on this area. Finally, a longitudinal study would enable an in-depth examination of occupational stress. It might be helpful for understanding how special education teachers deal with their occupational stress across their career. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Special education teacher attrition has been noted as a prevalent concern for many school districts. There is a critical need to add to the growing body of literature regarding special education teacher attrition and to determine based on the trend identified within the literature, additional reasons, that contribute to special education teachers choosing to leave their position. The problem under investigation was the ongoing critical shortage of special education teachers in Mississippi. The purpose of this multiple case study was to gain insight and understanding of factors that contribute to special education teacher attrition within an urban school district in Mississippi. The target population for this study was special education teachers who chose to leave their position and the school district and school administrators who provided perspectives on factors that affect special education teacher attrition. Multiple sources of data included a survey and interviews. Collection and analysis of data indicated that excessive workload, stress from job demands, and lack of administrative support and guidance most influence special education teachers to leave their position. The behavior of students, lack of effective mentors, lack of support, lack of professional development, paperwork, class size, and better opportunity/job relocation were factors found to contribute to special education teacher attrition. Insight regarding job satisfaction, teacher preparation, and workplace conditions that contributed to special education teachers choosing to leave their position should provide insight and information for school district leadership on strategies and activities focused on the recruitment and retention of special education teachers. Future research proposals should extend this investigation in urban and suburban school districts, as well as examine how the lack of specific course syllabi in pre-service teacher preparation programs contributes to special education teacher attrition. A comparative study on special education teachers from alternative teacher preparation programs and special education teachers from traditional teacher preparation programs regarding special education attrition should also extend this research.

AB  - This study investigated the perspectives of high school students with learning disabilities on co-teaching. Two focus groups were conducted at two high schools in southern California, involving 10 students with learning disabilities. Guiding questions were used to seek students' perceptions on how participation in co-taught general education environments has changed their lives, their teachers' jobs, and how it has impacted their peers. Results indicated that students prefer receiving instruction in pull-out settings and that they perceive that special education teachers provide distinctly different instruction than do general education teachers. Furthermore, students indicated that general education teachers did not always provide necessary accommodations for their learning disability in co-taught classrooms and that they could not easily access either the special or general educator in co-taught environments. Students at the two schools had varying perspectives on how their peers' perceived their special education services. These results are discussed in terms of four distinct themes: access to special education services, delivery of instruction, peer and teacher response, and class size.

AB  - National and state level data show students with disabilities are performing poorly in classrooms as compared to their same aged peers. National assessment data show a significant gap in English and math scores, while state data, such as graduation rate, show students with disabilities are the lowest performing subgroup in all 50 states. The purpose of this study is to create a blueprint for a systematic model to successfully educate students with disabilities. To achieve this outcome, the researcher used survey research to examine the top 10 and bottom 10 most implemented practices in schools with a successful special education subgroup, as well as those practices statistically different than an unsuccessful school. In addition, the researcher examined the top 10 and bottom 10 most necessary practices according to schools with a successful special education subgroup, as well as those practices statistically different than an unsuccessful school. Using quantitative data analysis, the researcher built a blueprint to establish a successful special education subgroup. The key components to this blueprint were: (a) a principal must establish a firm, inclusive vision, (b) a principal must employ leadership that values, listens, and communicates with teachers, (c) budgets should be allocated to instructional technology and professional development to improve staff understanding of the rationale for inclusive education, (d) a principal must establish at least partial inclusionary settings, and (e) a principal must plan and regularly monitor his special education program. Further research could be undertaken to identify specific instructional technology, as well as the most effective professional development on the rationale for inclusive education.

AB  - Little attention has been dedicated to monitoring the educational progress of students with EBD receiving services in restrictive settings, using empirically validated tools and procedures. This study compared the progress of students with EBD receiving special education services in either a self-contained school or self-contained classrooms to determine if these students were benefiting from placement in their respective settings. Progress was assessed using behavior rating scales, standardized measures, curriculum-based measures, and school record data. Results revealed limited academic improvement in either setting with no significant differences between groups on any of the standardized or curriculum-based measures, with the exception of written expression. In addition, there was limited progress in the behavioral and social domains. There were no significant differences in the progress of students in either setting in social skills, externalizing behavior, and disciplinary contacts. However, the internalizing behaviors were able to differentiate between groups. Implications of these findings were discussed in light of the limitations and directions for future research were offered.

AB  - This qualitative study explored the beliefs of teachers in the USA about the education of students with disabilities, focusing on their conceptualizations of inclusive education. Data were obtained through in-depth interviews with 30 teachers. The findings highlight multiple interpretations of inclusive education and suggest that teachers' support for inclusive education may be linked with the ways in which they conceptualize this practice. Most teachers' beliefs about the education of students with disabilities were embedded in dominant educational discourses that centered on the otherness of some students, and an unquestioned acceptance of implicit assumptions in special education. Findings support the need for a paradigm shift in teacher education, moving away from deficit models towards an understanding of inclusive education as linked with issues of social justice.

AB  - During 1999/2000, the Saginaw, Michigan public schools implemented a reduced class size program in grades 1 and 2. At grade 1 (23 rooms), reduced-size classes were maintained at no more than 18 pupils; at grade 2 (5 rooms), the limit was 21 pupils. Comparison classes were identified to assess the impact of the program. Students in both conditions were included in analyses of reading and math achievement and rates of special education placement, attendance, and promotion. At grade 1, no significant differences between the groups were found at the beginning or end of the year in reading or math. Similarly, no differences were found in any of the above-mentioned rates. At grade 2, students in reduced-size classes evidenced greater performance in reading (text leveling) at the end of the year; however, no pre-test was conducted on text leveling. In mathematics, the reduced-size class condition demonstrated higher performance at the end of the year. As with grade 1, there were no significant differences on other measures. (Concludes with recommendations to improve the assessment process. Appendices contain test results.) (EV)

AB  - Research indicates that a significant number of middle school students with disabilities perform better academically in classrooms with teachers who possess strong content knowledge and high expectations for their students. This mixed-method case study was designed to explore with a sample of principals their perceptions of why some middle school students with disabilities score higher on both standardized exams and report cards, based on the classroom structure to which they are placed. The rationale for this study emanated from the researcher's desire to uncover the optimal classroom structure for middle school students with disabilities. The purposefully selected sample was composed of six principals who were supervising schools that demonstrated both high and low levels of academic success for their students with disabilities from each structure. These principals were all supervising middle schools that contained grades 6–8. The primary data collection method was in-depth interviews. A supportive method of data collection was the use of a survey. The data were coded and organized according to the research questions. This research revealed that students with disabilities enter middle school with reading, writing and Math skills that are far below grade level. To combat this problem, principals must provide students with disabilities with a content area specialist. The principals also expressed that destigmatizing middle school students with disabilities was important for their academic growth. Finally, the principals of middle schools where students with disabilities showed academic success were able to identify high expectations for teachers as an important factor for student success. These findings were supported by the interview data. The researcher did not find significant differences on standardized exam scores based on the classroom structure. However, when combining the departmentalized and semi-departmentalized mean scores, there was a significant difference in Mathematics for Grade 7 students with disabilities. Recommendations were offered for principals, school administrators, and central administrators. Given that multiple factors influence academic success for students with disabilities, and a variety of classroom structures exists within middle schools, the recommendations put forth should be considered for their appropriateness on an individual basis.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe growth in student mathematics performance at the student and group levels as measured by the statewide mathematics test in Nebraska. Student groupings analyzed for differences in growth patterns were cohorts (elementary and middle school aged students), growth categories, grade levels, gender, ethnicity, students receiving special education (SPED) services, students receiving support services due to English not being their native language (ELL). Building differences were defined by average number of students per grade level (size), levels of student performance, levels of students receiving SPED services, and levels of students receiving ELL services. The Student Growth Percentile (SGP) methodology was the growth model employed to quantify learning growth in mathematics as measured by the Nebraska State Accountability (NeSA) mathematics assessment. This methodology meets federal requirements for accountability, provided student level growth scores, and compared students with similar testing history. The NeSA-M results (2010-2014) were analyzed using the SGP approach for grades 3-8. Analyses were run utilizing the open source SGP Package within the R Studio software application. The SGP assumptions were verified prior to testing for growth differences between student groups. Median SGPs matched expectations, and a variety of perspectives ensured that performance and growth scores were uncorrelated. These approaches confirmed that no relationship existed between performance and growth. Scatterplots were generated to evaluate possible ceiling and floor effects. The plots demonstrated the possibility of experiencing all levels of growth regardless of performance. Comparisons between groups of learners revealed significance due to the power of the study. Effect sizes were all small, which suggests little practical significance. The availability of more longitudinal data offers an opportunity for further investigation.

AB  - This study investigated students with specific learning disabilities (SLD), serious emotional disturbances (SED), and educable mental retardation (EMR) to determine if class size and class mix influence educational outcomes. A total of 110 students in 12 classrooms were included in the sample, which included classes with waivers (classes out of compliance with Virginia standards) for class size or class mix; waivered classes with SLD, SED, and EMR students; and classes in compliance with Virginia standards (non-waivered classes). Four academic achievement areas and nine affective areas were used as educational outcomes in the quantitative and qualitative research. Results indicated that student achievement is affected by class size; students in single disability classes appeared to have higher reading, math, and social studies achievement than students who were mixed with other disabilities; students in non-waivered classes had better general behavior and were making more progress toward their educational goals than students in waivered classes; student self-concept, motivation level, time on task, educational aspirations, liking of special education classes, and awareness of special education placement were not significantly different in waivered versus non-waivered classes; and teaching methods were not significantly different.

AB  - This federally funded study investigated Virginia special education program standards, focusing on local applications of the standards for class size and class mix and the effect of varying class size and class mix on student outcomes. The study concentrated on students with educable mental retardation, severe emotional disturbance, and specific learning disabilities. The research model involved interviews, observations, and document reviews at three local education agencies and a survey of over 1,000 special education teachers and administrators. The study found that: (1) Directors of Special Education and special education teachers consistently recommended smaller resource classes than current standards allow; (2) teachers believed that manageable class sizes with paraprofessionals were not much larger than manageable class sizes without paraprofessionals; (3) students in larger classes achieved at a lower level than students in smaller classes, with reading achievement affected more than mathematics and with elementary students affected more than secondary students; (4) smaller classes had no effect on students' self-concept, behavior, level of motivation, work habits, or interpersonal skills; (5) Directors supported mixing students with different disabilities in the same class while teachers did not; (6) mixing students with different disabilities had no effect on academic achievement, motivation, self-concept, work habits, or interpersonal skills; and (7) most Directors support noncategorical placement and integration into regular education. Appendices provide copies of the survey forms and various program administration materials. (JDD)

AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of special education resources in Rhode Island school districts, a self-study guide was completed by two districts and an effectiveness study performed in six other districts. The six district study gathered survey data from parents, resource teachers, and regular educators and analyzed program and performance data from student records. Results included that two-thirds of the parents reported good or very good progress in their child, that five out of six regular educators believed in the effectiveness of the special education resource program, and that resource teachers claimed that approximately one-third of the resource students were achieving a high rate of progress. Analysis further revealed that teacher caseload was significantly related to parent opinion on the effectiveness of the program and that class size was correlated with students' test performance. Findings were also reported regarding program cost and program effectiveness (including that students in high cost programs made stronger educational gains per year than students in low cost programs), communication and recent training.

AB  - Conducted 5 studies which compared small group and tutorial instruction in resource room settings. Ss were 32 primary-level children referred for resource assistance. Each S was taught both by a cross-age tutor (e.g., 5th and 6th graders) individually and by a resource teacher in a small group. Results suggest that Ss learned more from a tutor than in a small group. The effect was observed for word recognition, spelling, oral reading, and multiplication. Tutorial instruction was also superior to self-instruction, and tutors appeared to benefit academically from the experience. Results are seen to have policy implications for resource programs.

AB  - Previous research has reported that the effectiveness of special education in remediating learning difficulties varies as a function of the type of classroom placement, the student's age, and their intellectual ability. More recent findings have also suggested that a learning disability is not a single diagnostic entity, but rather distinct subtypes of learning disabled students exist. The study sought to determine if cluster analysis of the present sample yielded subtypes which conformed to previously identified LD subtypes; and whether these different subtypes of learning disabled (LD) students respond differentially in terms of the students academic achievement.The sample was comprised of 136 LD subjects between the ages of 9 and 15 years old for whom Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) data was available for both initial assessment, and re-assessment three years later.Initial comparisons of the sample were conducted by examining differences in academic achievement for the three subtests of the PIAT for two different types of educational placement: full time versus part time; by racial groups; and between pre and post test results. Three main effects were found in the initial MANOVA on the PIAT subtests of math and reading recognition, however, none of the statistically significant results were determined to be of practical significance. These statistical results were consistent with previous research findings.The sample was subtyped using cluster analysis. A three cluster solution was determined using three variables: intelligence, achievement, and age of the subject. The three subtypes were described and determined to be consistent with subtypes previously identified. Cluster 1 was dropped from further analysis as not conforming to an LD profile and because of sample size.A 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 MANOVA was performed: cluster membership by placement by race by pre-post test results. Cluster 2 students significantly declined in their reading recognition achievement over the three years they were in special education, while Cluster 3 students gained significantly in reading recognition achievement over the same time period.The present results suggest that school psychologist should carefully consider not only whether a student is learning disabled, but the nature and severity of the disability when recommending placement.

It explores some of the issues involved in conducting such research and considers the extent to which newly available national data in England can be helpful in answering questions about inclusion and achievement. Questions pertaining to the effects of provision on achievement are discussed within a school reform agenda that emphasizes high academic standards, competition between schools and the identification of pupils with special educational needs.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness and efficiency with which the Chippewa Falls Area United School District (Wisconsin) addressed the needs of its diverse student population, focusing on the At-Risk Kindergarten Program implemented by the school district in 1992. The program serves a selected segment of the kindergarten population in an all-day, every-day program which included a 1:15 maximum adult-child ratio to address the developmental and instructional needs of at-risk kindergartners. The purpose of this study was to determine how effective the current program is, to explore options for the program, and to draw conclusions about the program. The methods used to gather this information included discussions with the two At-Risk Kindergarten teachers and the superintendent of schools, surveys completed by parents, observations of students, and reviews of each child's progress. The findings highlighted the absolute necessity of individual and small-group instruction. Both teachers were found to be effective even though their styles of teaching differed, and the program was positively impacted by Instructional Assistants and Resource Specialists who supplied individual instruction to the children. Other findings included: (1) the same expectations were placed on at-risk children as on non-at-risk children; (2) instructional pacing was quicker in non-at-risk kindergarten classes than at-risk classes; and (3) the adjustment of the at-risk child to regular primary classes was often overwhelming for the student. (Includes copies of the questionnaires given to both staff and parents.) (DCP)

AB  - In recent years, the concept of individualized instruction has gained increasing attention among special educators, researchers, and policy makers in China. At the same time, many are concerned that as a concept borrowed from Western countries, individualized instruction may not be successfully implemented in China's social and cultural context. The literature, however, has revealed little empirical information about what Chinese teachers actually do and think about individualized instruction. This study therefore aimed to investigate Chinese special education teachers' perceptions and practices related to individualizing or adapting instruction for students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Specifically, the investigation focused on teachers who taught elementary Chinese language arts and math in public special education schools for students with IDD in Shanghai and were considered as effective teachers by school administrators. A generic qualitative research design was utilized. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 31 teachers from six schools. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the interview data. Analysis revealed that the participants shared many similarities in their practices and perceptions. In general, they recognized the wide range of student differences existing in their classrooms and the necessity of adapting instruction to accommodate student differences. However, in reality, practices and beliefs associated with one-size-fits-all approaches of teaching were prevalent. Although all participants described making efforts to address individual differences, these efforts seemed to be inadequate, as indicated by significant limitations in both assessment and adaptation practices reported in the study. The participants perceived fully addressing the needs of individual students as difficult and described challenges in four areas. The study revealed that teachers seemed to hold the conflicting perceptions that instruction should be adapted to accommodate individual needs and that the structure of standardized approaches of teaching should be maintained. In this context, a fenceng instruction method was used to address individual differences, which involved minor changes to traditional standardized approaches of teaching; instruction tailored to each individual's need was not found.

AB  - There is an extensive international research literature on the effect of ability grouping (e.g., tracking, streaming, banding, setting) on children's academic and behavioral outcomes. However, it is questionable to what extent the findings of research on this topic have influenced the practice of ability grouping in New Zealand schools. Fifteen high schools in Christchurch were surveyed regarding their policies and practices on ability grouping. Interviews focused on the types of grouping used in academic subject areas, perceived benefits and disadvantages of this grouping, and perceived consequences for average students, gifted students, students with special needs, and Māori and Pacific Island students. Reported grouping practices, and views about these, are compared with findings from the literature on ability grouping. The need for schools to adopt more evidence-based strategies for ability grouping are discussed and recommendations for practice and for further research are outlined.

AB  - In a study of cognitive therapy as a strategy for compensatory education, fourteen low-achieving first graders in the Holly Springs Separate School District (Mississippi) were assigned to treatment conditions consisting of a teacher trained in cognitive therapy, an aide, and a small class size. The therapy relied upon a clinical tutorial model involving identification of cognitive skill deficiencies and tutoring to eliminate the deficiencies in stepwise, hierarchical order. For grade two, the subjects were assigned to a teacher who was untrained in cognitive therapy, and the trained aide from the first year. In the third year, the experimental subjects were assigned to a regular classroom with a larger class size, while the control group during the first two years was exposed to the experimental conditions of cognitive therapy and a small class size. Achievement testing at the end of the study indicated that experimental subjects showed greater gains than controls after first grade, and continued to outperform the control group during second grade, even with minimum cognitive therapy input. Achievement differences in the third year (when experimental and control groups were switched) were not readily observable. The research demonstrated the importance of teacher training in using cognitive therapy as a compensatory education approach. (MJL)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine which states have policies about caseloads in special education and to examine the differences between those policies. Specifically, which states have policies about caseloads in special education? What are the specific details outlined by the policies? After examining the policies for each state and communicating with representatives from several states, state-by-state information was compiled. Twenty states have no guidance or policies about caseloads. Specific policies about caseload size were found for twenty states. Each state varies in which factors or combination of factors are used to determine special education teacher (SET) caseloads. The most common factor was disability category, followed by grade level and level of support. Comparing maximum caseload size state-by-state can be difficult, since the states that have more specific guidance regarding caseloads have a variety of factors that determine their caseload policies.

AB  - The Augmented Staffing model of the Chicago Public Schools (Illinois) is a reduced class size, full-day program that includes almost 6,500 elementary school students served under Chapter 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The effects of this program were studied, examining the level of teacher knowledge about the program and its implementation, the achievement of the program's students, and program characteristics. Data are from the school system's overall report on Chapter 1 programs, which incorporated 660 observations, and questionnaires completed by 192 teachers in 1990, 441 in 1991, 99 in 1992, and 164 in 1993. Results suggest that reduced class size in itself is not sufficient to improve student test scores, but that achievement levels can rise when teachers employ more techniques associated with higher order thinking skills even though teachers relieved of the pressure of large classes do have an opportunity to diagnose their students' needs more carefully. Three tables present study data. (Contains 11 references.) (SLD)

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate the perspectives of five grade 7 and 8 boys identified with behaviour difficulties to determine their perceptions regarding whether their schools are meeting their educational needs. Data was collected using small focus groups. All the participants were enrolled in a segregated program, known here by the pseudonym Opportunities, during the time of the focus group discussions. Furthermore, the participants were able to reflect back on their previous experiences in their regular classrooms. In order to modify regular classrooms to meet the participants' needs they recommended: reducing class sizes in the higher elementary grades, making additional support personnel available to help them within their classes, and finding teachers who are especially caring and supportive of students identified with special needs.

AB  - This monograph summarizes and evaluates "educational production function analyses"--studies of the relation between inputs and outputs in an education system--in order to aid in educational manpower policy making. In addition, data from New York state school districts and from a large national sample of high school students is subjected to multiple regression analyses for information on the cost effectiveness of different inputs. Inputs which policy makers can influence--teacher characteristics (length of service, graduate training, verbal ability), class size, quality and quantity of school administrators, and use of educational technology--are examined. Comparisons are made of the effect on student achievement levels of spending a fixed amount of money on several different types of school inputs. The study finds that all inputs are not equally productive for all grade levels or all subject matter specialties. For instance, neither teacher experience nor degree affect student achievement at grades K-3; the contrary, however, is true in grades 3-6. Incentive pay might, therefore, best be turned to increasing student-teacher ratios at grades K-3 and bolstered in grades 3-6 at the expense of class size. (JH)

AB  - Examined the classroom behavior of children with disabilities in both social and mastery domains. Also, the relations among child characteristics, classroom characteristics, and children's behaviors were examined. 153 children (mean age 40.4 mo) with disabilities (49 with Down syndrome, 57 with motor impairment, and 47 with developmental delays) were observed in a total of 148 preschool classrooms. Social interaction with peers and teachers, strategies employed in attempts to master tasks, and use of time in the classroom were recorded by trained blind observers using a modified time sampling procedure. Analyses indicated significant relations between Ss' classroom behavior and 3 selected classroom characteristics: degree of integration, teacher–child ratio, and the extent to which Ss could choose activities. Ss with higher levels of cognitive performance displayed more advanced levels of social interaction and mastery task involvement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study sought to systematically examine the academic behavior of children with ADHD in different instructional contexts in an analogue classroom setting. A total of 33 children with ADHD participated in a reading comprehension activity followed by a testing period and were randomly assigned within days to either small-group instruction, whole-group instruction, or independent seatwork. The effects of instructional contexts on on-task behavior during instruction and on-task behavior and work productivity during testing were examined. Children with ADHD were found to be more on task during small-group instruction than both whole-group and independent seatwork instructional conditions. In the testing context, children with ADHD were found to be less productive in small-group than in the whole-group and independent seatwork conditions. The findings of this study have implications for future research evaluating the standard educational practices and accommodations made for children with ADHD in the classroom setting.

AB  - This article presents case studies of five students who had experienced school failure and chose to attend either of two public charter schools in Texas. In all cases, small school and class size appeared to be the critical factors in the creation of small, caring, learning communities that promoted changing attitudes and negative school experiences into positive ones.

AB  - While calls to reduce class size in school have considerable popular appeal, the related discussion of the scientific evidence has been limited and highly selective. The evidence about improvements in student achievement that can be attributed to smaller classes turns out to be meager and unconvincing. In the aggregate, pupil-teacher ratios have fallen dramatically for decades, but student performance has not improved. Explanations for these aggregate trends, including more poorly prepared students and the influence of special education, are insufficient to rationalize the overall patterns. International comparisons fail to show any significant improvements for having smaller pupil-teacher ratios. Detailed econometric evidence about the determinants of student performance confirms the general lack of any achievement results from smaller classes. Finally, widely cited experimental evidence actually offers little support for general reductions in class size. In sum, while policies to reduce class size may enjoy popular political appeal, such policies are very expensive and, according to the evidence, quite ineffective. (Contains 29 references.)

AB  - The main tradition of research on effects of resources on results investigates educational production functions in which input factors are related to output in statistical models. Many such studies have been conducted but the results tend to be inconsistent, and conclusions from reviews conflict. However, several recent meta-analytic integrations of the estimates from different studies indicate positive effects of resources such as per pupil expenditure, class size, teacher education and teacher experience. Methodological limitations of the production function approach imply, however, that these results should be interpreted with caution. In a more recent approach, randomized experiments have been conducted, with a special focus on the effects of class size. In the largest and most thoroughly analyzed study (the STAR experiment), smaller classes were found to have an advantage at the primary level. Meta-analytic summaries of the effects of class-size also support the conclusion that smaller classes are beneficial in early grades, and particularly so for students with less favorable socio-economic backgrounds. Alternative interpretations of the class size effect are discussed, and it is suggested that it may be due to a more effective socialization to the school environment in smaller classes. Another line of research has established large differences between teachers in terms of the achievement of their students. The research evidence also suggests that teacher education, teacher experience, and in-service training influence teacher competence. It is concluded that class size may be of importance for certain categories of students, while teacher competence appears to be the single most important resource factor.

AB  - New York University studied the impact of increases in instructional group size in resource rooms and speech service in the New York City Public Schools by examining increases in 45 public elementary, middle, and senior high schools. Questionnaires were distributed to parents, and teachers and administrators were interviewed. Observations of resource rooms and analysis of achievement data in reading and arithmetic for general education and resource room students also provided study data. About $26 million was saved from the resource room program, an amount that agreed with projected savings. There was a substantial decrease in the reading achievement scores of resource room students, especially at the sixth grade level. Mathematics scores also declined, but not significantly. Resource room teachers reported that the increase in instructional group size diminished their ability to help students. Direct observations of resource room instruction revealed that very little time was spent on individual instruction. Most resource room students received group instruction. Students, on the whole, did tend to be on task in resource room instruction. Observation also indicated that about one-fourth of instructional time was spent escorting students to and from their classrooms, further decreasing instructional time. As students moved through the grades, they were progressively less likely to attend the resource rooms. Parents, who generally thought that the resource room helped their children, were not usually aware of the instructional group size. Waiting lists for students requiring speech services were reduced substantially, but data were insufficient to determine the impact of changed group size on speech service. These findings led to the recommendation that no more than five students should receive resource room instruction at one time. Eleven appendixes contain questionnaires and study correspondence. (Contains five tables.) (SLD)

AB  - Two hundred first grade children participated in an experimental program involving innovative curricula and instructional techniques. A pretest-posttest method of instruction, employing sequenced and structured learning activities, enabled each child to progress at an individual rate and was supplemented by a readiness program. Evaluation of the project was undertaken to determine the effect of generous expenditures, used to modify basic conditions (class size, for example), on achievement levels. Ability and achievement tests were administered to both the experimental and comparison groups throughout the year. Analysis revealed that although the average mental age was 6 months lower for the experimental group, it essentially matched the comparison group on achievement at the end of the school year. If mental age is used as a covariate, the experimental group exceeded the comparison group on 8 of the 10 achievement variables. The effect of other variables, including readiness, sex, father's occupation, integration, grouping, Head Start, and variable interactions on achievement are also reported. The validity of the Metropolitan Readiness Test is discussed in detail and implications of the study are pointed out. Instructional materials used in the project are listed in the appendix. (PR)

AB  - Meta-analysis is formulated as a special case of a multilevel (hierarchical data) model in which the highest level is that of the study and the lowest level that of an observation on an individual respondent. Studies can be combined within a single model where the responses occur at different levels of the data hierarchy and efficient estimates are obtained. An example is given from studies of class sizes and achievement in schools, where study data are available at the aggregate level in terms of overall mean values for classes of different sizes, and also at the student level.

The first deals with the effects of the placement of low-IQ pupils in resource rooms or full-time special education classes. The second and third took specifically at the two principal types of intervention offered in the name of differential diagnostic-prescriptive special education, that is, perceptual-motor and psycholinguistic training. The data contained in these reviews form the basis for some concluding thoughts on effective teaching and educational policy.

AB  - The general aim of the present study was to explore how head teachers (N = 683) for older students and head teachers (N = 250) for younger students in Swedish compulsory schools describe handling procedures of special education issues in their schools. Two questionnaire surveys on such issues were conducted during the spring term of 2008 among head teachers in a nationally representative sample of schools. Questionnaire answers from the head teachers show that even though the most common type of special support measure is that students are supported by special education teachers in regular classes/groups, the overall picture that emerges is that the 'old traditional ways' in special education support giving are still the most common. Social background and context as well as schoolwork content and teaching habits are judged as key factors behind the students' difficulties and need for special education support. In general, however, school problems and students' difficulties seem still to mainly be seen as caused by student characteristics and disabilities rather than as shortcomings of school and teaching. Differences in head teacher answer profiles could be identified. Such school profiles are also discussed as part of further study planned, where they will be compared to individual data on school experience, and learning data, which are available from the same schools as the head teachers approached.

AB  - The purpose of this meta-analysis was to synthesize findings from 42 interventions (randomized control trials and quasi-experimental studies) on instructional approaches that enhance the mathematics proficiency of students with learning disabilities. We examined the impact of four categories of instructional components: (a) approaches to instruction and/or curriculum design, (b) formative assessment data and feedback to teachers on students' mathematics performance, (c) formative data and feedback to students with LD on their performance, and (d) peer-assisted mathematics instruction. All instructional components except for student feedback with goal-setting and peer-assisted learning within a class resulted in significant mean effects ranging from 0.21 to 1.56. We also examined the effectiveness of these components conditionally, using hierarchical multiple regressions. Two instructional components provided practically and statistically important increases in effect size-teaching students to use heuristics and explicit instruction. Limitations of the study, suggestions for future research, and applications for improvement of current practice are discussed. (Contains 2 notes and 2 tables.)

AB  - This report discusses the activities and outcomes of Special Instructional Assistance (SIA) an early intervention, prevention program designed to help Georgia students with identified developmental delays overcome the effects of those delays on academic achievement. The central tenet of the program is to provide more individualized instruction to eligible students by either reducing the number of students in a classroom (reduced class size model) or by adding a second certified teacher (augmented model) into a classroom. The evaluation of the SIA program utilized data gathered from observations, focus groups, surveys, students' Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) scores, and data from the state's student information systems. During the 1998-99 school year the SIA program served nearly 80,000 children throughout all areas of the state, at a cost of approximately 104 million dollars. The data show that, on the whole, teachers and administrators view the SIA program as a positive force in Georgia's schools. The primary benefit, widely articulated throughout each of the evaluation data sources, is the ability to reduce class size, via one of the two program models, and provide more individualized instruction to SIA and non-SIA students. Recommendations are provided for expanding the program. (Author/CR)

AB  - The impacts of school resources on student achievement have been debated for half a century with no consensus reached among scholars. This topic has received increasing attention under the backdrop of both the educational accountability movement and the economic downturn of recent years. Using student and school-level longitudinal datasets from Florida, this study examines the impacts of school resources on student achievement in math. The study also examines whether and how the impacts of school resources vary for students with different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, and whether the marginal effects of school inputs diminish with input levels. Overall, this study does not find consistent evidence showing a causal relation between added school expenditure and student achievement in math within school-and-principals. However, the results indicate that differences in per student expenditures are statistically related to differences in student achievement in math across schools and principals at the elementary and middle school levels. Since these correlations may stem from the impacts of unobserved characteristics of students, schools and principals, further investigations are necessary to make firm conclusions. This study calls more attention to the way current resources are used. More specifically, neither a reduction in class size nor an increase in average years of teacher experience may improve student academic performance. However, an increase in the percentages of teachers with advanced degrees may raise student achievement in math at the elementary and high school levels. The percentages of classes being taught by in-field teachers also matters for student achievement at high school level. This study also indicates that the impacts of per student expenditure and class size may vary for students with different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds, thus more attention should to be given to the special needs of these disadvantaged groups. However, since some conditional funding programs are not considered in this study, further investigations need to be conducted for more definitive conclusions.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that pupil achievement is inversely related to class size, a 5-year study (1959-1964) examined the relationship between class size and pupil achievement in reading and arithmetic. Data were taken from records of the Baltimore public school system for all 16,449 grade 3 pupils in the class of 1959, comprised of 6,568 regular white pupils, 8,341 regular nonwhite pupils, 441 special education white pupils, and 1,099 special education nonwhite pupils. Pupils in smaller classes in both the regular and special education curricula were found to make significantly greater achievement gains than students in larger classes. Smallest class size (1-25) was considerably more productive for nonwhite than for white students. Other variables correlated to class size and pupil achievement included pupil home mobility, parental occupation and level of education, percentage of nonwhite faculty, faculty knowledge, and faculty experience. A review of related research and a description of the research design are included. Extensive comparisons from the study's findings are tabulated and described. (JK)

AB  - debunk the notion that special education can't strengthen children's school performance / believe there needs to be a sizable net decrease in numbers of students in special education, the number of special education teachers should remain constant / it will reduce student–teacher ratios in many places, maximizing opportunities for teachers to become more effective / reducing student–teacher ratios should permit special educators to spend more time in general education, working to ensure better responsiveness to and accommodations of mainstreamed students with disabilities, as well as low-achieving, nondisabled students who might otherwise flounder downsizing the number of students, but not teachers, in special education can pave the way for 3 systemic and timely changes: (a) special education can better explain who it serves—and strengthen its credibility—by reducing 'false positives' (i.e., children labeled 'disabled' who are not); (b) special education can better demonstrate its effectiveness and justify its cost by decreasing student–teacher ratios and assuming an 'outcomes-based' mentality; and (c) special education can work closely with general education by encouraging more special educators to work part time in mainstram classrooms with students who are in trouble, academically or otherwise, but not disabled / suggest special education follow a policy of 'reverse triage': students with some coping skills (with some chance of making it in the mainstream) should be sent to general education, despite a discouraging prognosis for them there (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Among Canadian teacher unions, discussions of class size are increasingly being informed by the importance of considering the diversity of student needs within the classroom (often referred to as class composition). For teachers, both class size and diversity matter. Teachers consistently adapt their teaching to address the individual needs of the learners in their classroom. As the classroom becomes larger and more diverse, this task becomes increasingly more onerous. Class size and composition also have obvious implications for inclusive education--if class composition is the degree of student diversity, broadly conceived, in the classroom, inclusion is the extent to which teachers have--or not--the necessary supports and services to be able to effectively integrate students with special educational needs into their classrooms and schools. Indeed research has demonstrated that "smaller classes may have the greatest positive impact on students with the greatest educational needs." This paper presents what class size research says about education quality and equity. It also presents some important lessons drawn from one of the class size surveys. (Contains 4 charts.)

AB  - This document summarizes the major studies published on class size and composition for the period 1900-96. It begins by examining the various indices that catalogue research on class size and also looks at those that provide abstracts of published articles, monographs, and government documents. These indices were used to compile a select bibliography with special emphasis on the period 1975-95, which seems to be representative of research as a whole. A content analysis of these documents, along with an ethnographic assessment, yield insights on the principal features of the research, as well as patterns. The study found that questions about class size and composition have been explored since the early 1900s, a time when urban classrooms often accommodated 60 students and one-room rural schools were commonplace. Over the decades the debate over class-size effects has continued, with several positions becoming evident. Some researchers believe that class size neither enhances nor diminishes academic achievement, whereas others have found that relationships do exist between class size and student outcomes. Much of the research focuses on student achievement, with few studies addressing student and teacher attitudes. Unfortunately, less than half of the research on class size and composition is methodologically sound and statistically valid. (Contains 55 references.) (RJM)

AB  - This report summarizes the findings of some recent pivotal studies of class size, especially as they relate to students at risk. Of particular note is a large-scale study of class size, which was designed to test the conclusions of G. Glass and M. Smith (1978) and G. Robinson (1990) about the advantages of small class size. This study, Project Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio (Project STAR) was conducted in Tennessee beginning in 1985. Project STAR was a controlled scientific experiment that studied a large number of teachers (over 300 each year) and a large number of students (more than 10,000 in all) over 4 years. Both norm-referenced and curriculum-referenced tests were administered each year. Because of the tight experimental control of Project STAR and the magnitude of the study, educations can be confident of certain principles: (1) small classes (17 pupils or fewer) are more effective academically than larger classes (22 and above) in the primary grades in all subject areas; (2) the advantage of small classes is greater for minority students and students in inner-city schools than for white students; and (3) the advantage of small classes can probably be attributed to the fact that students are more actively engaged in learning compared to their peers in larger classes. Even these strong findings do not fully resolve questions of the cost effectiveness of small classes. In addition, there is still not enough information to tell whether small classes might be especially advantageous if the teachers received special training to take advantage of small class size. There is little information to tell whether small classes could be especially beneficial when used in conjunction with other compensatory or accelerated programs. Current research does not tell much about the effects of small class size in middle school or high school. (Contains 13 references.) (SLD)

AB  - A cost effectiveness study by the Austin (Texas) Independent School District of its elementary compensatory reading programs, namely, the Chapter 1 Reading Improvement Program (Chapter 1 Regular) and Schoolwide Projects (SWP), found that the Schoolwide Projects cost two to three times as much to achieve the same gains in student achievement as did the Chapter 1 Regular program. Both programs are funded by the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act Chapter 1. Both programs measure improvement in reading skills with the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The programs differ in the way that instruction is delivered. Chapter 1 students receive supplementary instruction from a reading specialist. SWP students receive all of their instruction in a classroom with students of mixed achievement levels, but where the pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced to 15-to-1. To measure achievement gains, percentiles were converted to Normal Curve Equivalents (NCE) and students' pre-test scores were compared to their post-test scores. Only teachers' salaries were used as the program cost. The cost per student was divided by the average NCE gain to obtain a cost-effectiveness figure that translates into dollars per NCE gain for each program for each year of implementation. A list of references is included. Statistical data are included on four tables. (FMW)

AB  - From 1996 to 1999, an inclusive early special educational model was studied in 13 ordinary kindergartens in Finland. The kindergartens received an additional staff member (a special teacher) to handle special educational issues. The work of these special teachers and the views of the staff were studied. The special teachers' duties consisted of six main tasks, the most often mentioned being general and special educational work and consultation with adults. The staff were generally satisfied with the new system. They received assistance and learnt new ways of working. However, the special teacher did not have enough time to meet all the needs that existed in kindergartens. This experimental model is now a permanent system.

AB  - To examine possible trends in teachers' attitudes, felt competence, and need for support for inclusion in special education, a questionnaire was given to 108 teachers from 3 school districts. While respondents expressed positive attitudes, each district differed by the amount of involvement in inclusion programs. Teachers' competence ratings were highest on items related to working with colleagues and parents, knowledge of students' characteristics, and strategies in evaluation. The teachers' most important needs involved class size, administrative support, extra personnel, and preparation time. Items related to education, on the job training (inservice), and college coursework were rated lowest. There was a significant difference in attitude between those teachers who had previous experience with disabilities and those who did not. In addition, a strong positive relationship was found between attitudes and felt competence. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study was designed to test the following hypothesis: no significant differences will exist in the responses to a questionnaire by student teachers and supervising teachers assigned to two different programs of student teaching--one large group and two small groups. The control program was the normal program of supervision that is typically employed by the college supervisor. The experimental program involved a considerably larger number of student teachers under the supervision of one college supervisor. The college supervisor utilized special approaches with the experimental supervising teachers and student teachers to make accommodations for the large number of students. An evaluative questionnaire was administered to the student teachers and supervising teachers at the end of the quarter. It was found that the large-group program was affected to some extent by the lack of classroom observations by the college supervisor, especially in his ability to evaluate and write recommendations. However, the progress of the student teacher did not appear to be influenced by the type of supervisory program, and both college supervisors were rated highly. It was concluded that teachers and students seemed to respond to the expectations of the particular supervisory program and accept the approach provided. The hypothesis was rejected. Tables illustrate methods of comparison of groups and means of scoring and evaluation. Appendixes give examples of final questionnaires given to the participants in the program. (Author/JD)

AB  - Although placement in less restrictive settings is generally believed to be associated with more positive social outcomes for students with disabilities, the empirical research has yielded equivocal findings. This study sought to synthesize the empirical research comparing the self-concept of students with learning disabilities (LD) in different educational placements. Meta-analysis revealed no overall association between self-concept and educational placement for 4 out of 5 comparisons: regular class vs resource room, regular class vs self-contained class, resource room vs self-contained class, and regular class vs special school. Students with LD receiving instruction in self-contained classrooms in regular schools exhibited lower self-concept compared to students with LD attending special schools. Follow-up analyses were conducted to explore whether the variability of effect sizes in regular class-resource room comparisons was associated with any of several potential moderator variables; the only variable for which the association approached significance was whether students in the regular classroom were provided with appropriate special education supports and services. Findings are discussed in light of documented individual variation in students' placement preferences. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Both general and special education teachers in the US are faced with complex classroom ecologies (D. S. Speece & B. K. Keogh, 1996). The broadening range of cultural, linguistic, and academic diversity among students coupled with increasing class sizes poses a challenge for teachers in their efforts to provide appropriate reading instruction for all students. This challenge is particularly acute as teachers plan and implement instruction for students with disabilities for whom learning to read is very difficult. A variety of grouping formats, such as peer tutoring, have been offered as having promise for meeting individual needs within large, diverse classroom settings. However, the impact of these grouping formats on the development of reading skills for students with disabilities has not been determined. A synthesis of the research on grouping formats for reading instruction for students with disabilities is warranted, particularly in light of recent reforms in special education and in grouping practices for reading instruction. The meta-analysis discussed in this chapter was reported/published between 1975 and 1995 and the majority of Ss were in Grades 1–6. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined whether any differential effects occur in the behavior of mildly mentally retarded children in educable mentally retarded (EMR) classrooms as a result of variations in class size. Ss were 393 children (mean age 11.3 yrs; mean IQ 66) in 25 EMR classes in which there were approximately 12, 15, or 19 Ss each. A time-sampling technique was used to record the behavior of all Ss in each classroom in 4 categories: communication, attend, not attend, and disrupt. It was found that classroom behavior did appear to differ as a function of size of class, and these differences were most apparent in communication of Ss. There was more verbalizaton or gestures in smaller classrooms, less in medium-size classrooms, and least in the largest classrooms. Attending behavior, on the other hand, tended to be associated with large classrooms, perhaps because there is less opportunity in large classrooms for interactive communication.

AB  - Given the rising prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schools are serving an increasing number of students with ASD (Scull & Winkler, 2011). Researchers have highlighted active engagement as a critical component of effective interventions for students with ASD (National Research Council, 2001), yet there is limited research related to engagement in school-age children with ASD. Joint engagement, which reflects the social nature of engagement, is a known area of deficit in young children with ASD (Adamson, Bakeman, Deckner, & Romski, 2009) and may be an ideal construct for assessing the engagement of older students with ASD in the classroom. This descriptive study was designed to examine the relationship of joint engagement with classroom ecological factors and student characteristics. The sample included 25 elementary and middle school students with ASD served in eight self-contained special education classrooms across three different school districts. Joint engagement was measured during typical classroom instruction in individual, small group, and large group sessions using live coding procedures. Data for the independent variables included the classroom ecological factors of group size, teachers' use of student directed practices, teacher interaction style and teacher report of burnout, and the student characteristics of autism severity, expressive communication, and receptive vocabulary. Mixed level modeling was used to examine relationships between joint engagement and the independent variables. Joint engagement was significantly related to group size, teachers' use of student-directed practices, students' autism severity, and students' expressive communication skills. There were no significant relationships of joint engagement with teacher interaction styles, teacher report of burnout, and students' receptive vocabulary skills. Additionally, the consistency of joint engagement as measured by within student variance was 38%, 66%, and 82% for large group, small group, and individual contexts, respectively. These findings have important implications for educational policies and practices and future research related to active engagement and effective interventions for students with ASD.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate both the relative effectiveness of different instructional personnel and the effect of differences in group size upon oral language acquisition for educationally disadvantaged first grade children. Involved in the treatment program were 23 classes in eight schools, all serving lower class areas of a southern metropolitan city. From these classes, a sample of 290 subjects was drawn, half boys and half girls. All of the children had IQ scores ranging from 60 to 110 on the pretest. Language development over the year was measured by the administration of the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Peabody Language Production Inventory. Though small differences in progress were observed among groups receiving their instruction under various conditions, statistical analysis indicated that these differences could not be accounted for by either of the experimental variables. The results suggest that a well designed instructional program can be equally effective under a variety of conditions. (TS)

AB  - This paper describes and evaluates Grand Academy, an alternative junior high school set up in New York City by a local district and a nonprofit community-based organization to meet the needs of students who have twice failed to meet Board of Education promotioal standards in the seventh grade. The instructional program, provided by the school district, offers small class size, specially trained teachers, a variety of multimedia materials, and instructional management systems. Career education is infused into the regular curriculum. Intensive support services, vocational services, and afterschool programs are offered by the community organization. In general, findings suggest that the alternative school improves student's academic performance and behavior. They become motivated to attend school and project high aspirations for the future. But, they continue to lag so far behind academically that when they move out of the alternative school environment they are still unable to function effectively in the basic skills area. For most of these students, a strong vocational preparation program with a view toward termination of traditional schooling and entrance into the world of work may be the soundest plan. However, the success of the Grand Academy alternative demonstrates the importance of intervention at the junior high level in order to prevent dropping out. (KH)

AB  - In this year-long qualitative study we found that most early childhood student teachers involved children with special needs in project work and realized its benefits. The factors that promoted children's involvement were familiarity and interest in the topic, comfort with the size and composition of the small group, and the use of open-ended, child-centered activities. While challenged, student teachers were able to meet the broad range of developmental levels through project work. They recognized and valued how project work can promote acceptance of diversity. Positive field experiences in an inclusive setting incorporating project work deepened student teachers' understanding of children with special needs.

AB  - Little research exists to help us understand why some beginning special education teachers of reading engage in more effective classroom practices than others. Factors that may influence these differences include personal attributes, preparation, and school environment. This mixed-methods study examined beginning special education teachers (N = 25) who taught reading to elementary students. Teachers were identified as most accomplished, moderately accomplished, and least accomplished, as defined by an overall classroom practice score. Interviews, observational field notes, and survey data on preparation and work environment revealed that the most accomplished beginners were consistently reflective, resourceful, and relentless and used these attributes to improve instruction, whereas others varied in this regard. Furthermore, while adequately prepared in special education, beginners reported inadequate preparation in reading. The interplay of personal attributes, preparation, and school environment seems to be a powerful determinant of a teacher's level of accomplishment.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the number of students with special needs (designated as exceptional or receiving special education services) in grade-3 classrooms in 1997-1998 and their achievement scores in reading, writing, and mathematics on Ontario's provincial assessment with their peers without special needs. When the variance due to differences in class size and socio-economic status was removed, the correlations between the number of students with special needs and the average class achievement scores were slightly, but significantly, positive (0.05 to 0.07), suggesting that the presence of students with special needs does not adversely affect achievement of other students.

AB  - In South Africa, many learners with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) attend mainstream and private schools. This study explores the influence of executive function (EF) challenges experienced by one learner with ASD on his behavioural adaptation in an inclusive school environment. An interpretive case study approach was followed to help understand one unique ASD learner and explain the complexity of the behavioural adaptation challenges that he was experiencing. Observations and an interview were used as data collection methods. During data analysis, themes were identified within each section of the transcript. The processes of coding and categorising were employed to find connections and similarities between all the data collected. The results indicate that Learner T experienced EF challenges. Without acquiring and implementing appropriate EF skills, he found it difficult to exhibit appropriate social behaviour in the inclusive learning environment. The study attempts to debunk misconceptions people may have regarding the behavioural adaptability of ASD learners in an inclusive school environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore regular teachers' perceptions and experiences of supports and obstacles to communicative interactions for students with multiple and severe disabilities (MSD). Five teachers of students with MSD participated in two in-depth interviews. Interview transcripts were analysed using content analysis. Transcripts were coded into categories, which were then grouped to yield content themes. Participants identified a broad range of themes, including: the complex needs of students with MSD, teachers' training and experience, communication education for teachers, the presence of peers without disabilities, the mainstream classroom, other staff in the school context, resources, infrastructure, the culture, size and geographical location of the school, the home context, support from specialist personnel outside the school, including collaboration with speech-language pathologists, the role of government departments, and broader societal factors. There are complex, systemic influences on access to communicative interactions for students with MSD in mainstream school settings. Inadequate systemic supports restrict communicative interactions between students with MSD and their teachers and peers without disabilities, and limit the involvement of students with MSD in mainstream classroom activities. Further research is required with teachers of students with MSD to substantiate these preliminary findings. (Contains 3 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - In my first chapter, I explore the relationship between school size and student achievement where, conditional on observable educational inputs, school size is a proxy for factors that are difficult to measure directly ( e.g., school climate and organization). Using data from the NELS:88, I estimate a series of value-added education production functions by including a different combination of educational inputs in each specification, and each series is estimated separately for urban, suburban, and rural locations. I find that the relationship between school size and student achievement in suburban areas is largely due to observable inputs (e.g., teacher characteristics and course offerings). In urban and rural areas, I find a U-shaped relationship between school size and achievement that is primarily due to unobservable inputs. The findings suggest that one size does "not" fit all, but that relatively small and relatively large schools in urban and rural areas may benefit students due to factors such as community involvement and engaging school climate associated with smaller schools, and teacher specialization and school organization associated with larger schools. In my second chapter, I use alternative measures of class size to illustrate that inherent differences in these measures can partially explain the inconclusive evidence found in prior studies of the effect of class size on student outcomes. With data from the NELS:88 and ELS:2002, I use teacher-student ratios that vary in the level of aggregation (i.e., student, school, and state-level data) and in the types of teachers included (i.e., all teachers versus only teachers in specific subjects). I estimate multiple value-added education production functions of math achievement, each using an alternative class size measure, for two cohorts of public high school students to illustrate that identically constructed teacher-student ratios yield substantially different results over time. Overall, my findings show that the composition of teachers in the school varies substantially across schools and over time, indicating that the most commonly used measure of class size--the school's teacher-student ratio--may be a poor indicator of school quality, and that the core teacher-student ratio is likely to provide richer information about school quality than other class size measures. In my third chapter, I estimate the effect of extracurricular participation on the high school dropout decision with a particular focus on at-risk students (i.e., those in economically disadvantaged families or schools in 8th grade). Using a sample of 10th grade public school students from the NELS:88, I estimate a bivariate probit model of the dropout and participation decisions, including extracurricular offerings per student and eligibility requirements as instruments in the extracurricular participation equation. A novel feature of this paper is the interaction between the participation and at-risk indicators in the dropout equation, where past disadvantages may affect the amount of skill and social capital acquired from extracurricular participation, yielding differences in the expected value of additional schooling between at-risk students and their peers. I find that all else equal, extracurricular participants, and especially athletic and "other" club participants, are significantly less likely to drop out of high school than non-participants, though at-risk participants are more likely to drop out relative to not-at-risk participants. These findings suggest that skills and peer networks developed through extracurricular activities are especially important determinants of school completion for at-risk youth.

AB  - A comparison was made of the verbal praise and criticism behaviors of teachers instructing in different types of classrooms. Fifty-seven teachers were observed in their various seventh and eighth grade classrooms: (1) nonhandicapped, small class size (5-15 students); (2) nonhandicapped, large class size (20 or more students); (3) special (students with learning disabilities); and (4) tutoring (one teacher for one or two students). Comparisons were made by rating the number of praise and criticism incidents initiated by the teachers, differences of teachers responses to boys and girls, and amount of praise and criticism directed toward groups of different sizes. Findings indicated that the verbal praise and criticism behaviors of teachers in one type of classroom did not significantly differ from those of teachers in another type of classroom. Although the majority of teachers used more praise than criticism, it appeared that they were not systematically using praise to manage student behavior but that their praise and criticism were reactions to student behavior. Praise was equally distributed among girls and boys; however, more criticism was directed toward boys, but not in significant amounts. Teachers were inclined to level criticism more frequently toward groups of students rather than to individuals. Among suggestions for future research on this topic is that an exploration be made of teacher verbal praise and criticism behaviors between beginning teachers and experienced teachers. (JD)

AB  - This research abstract is based on two studies: first, "Student and Instructional Outcomes under Varying Student-Teacher Ratios in Special Education" and, second, "A Case Study Analysis of Factors Related to Effective Student-Teacher Ratios", both by Martha L. Thurlow and others. The studies investigated the effects of various student-teacher ratios on quantitative and qualitative outcome measures and explored the interaction of this variable with other factors that contribute to student performance. Subjects were 139 elementary special education students. Results indicated that under lower student-teacher ratios, students spent more time in active academic responses and academic engaged time; teachers more often checked for student understanding and provided greater task relevance, more feedback, and more adaptive instruction. Under higher ratios, there was more time spent in student-teacher discussion, the entire group setting, teacher initiated tasks, management responses, and inappropriate responses. Differences were not found in measures of task completion and success. Case studies in the second report showed that academic responding time varies not only as a function of student-teacher ratios but also as a result of characteristics of the student and the home and community environments.

AB  - Thirty-two qualitative investigations of co-teaching in inclusive classrooms were included in a metasynthesis employing qualitative research integration techniques. It was concluded that co-teachers generally supported co-teaching, although a number of important needs were identified, including planning time, student skill level, and training; many of these needs were linked to administrative support. The dominant co-teaching role was found to be "one teach, one assist," in classrooms characterized by traditional instruction, even though this method is not highly recommended in the literature. The special education teacher was often observed to play a subordinate role. Techniques often recommended for special education teachers, such as peer mediation, strategy instruction, mnemonics, and training of study skills, self advocacy skills, and self-monitoring, were infrequently observed.

AB  - This paper examines the research on how student-to-instructor ratio effects influence schooling, with particular attention to how the research relates to low-achieving children. It also summarizes the conclusions of several existing reviews of literature on: the effects on schooling outcomes of class or instructional group size; and scheduled, instructional, or engagement time. Findings include the following: (1) Reduced class size appeared to be most efficacious with low-ability or disadvantaged students when reductions were in the range typically associated with programs administered under Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981. (2) Such reductions can lead to better student and teacher attitudes and morale and to an enrichment of the core curriculum. (3) Increases in allocated, instructional, and engaged time lead to increases in learning. (4) Allocated time shows a lesser relation to achievement than more proximal time measures. (5) The greater amount of allocated time given to Chapter 1 students may serve to lessen an advantage that more able students possess because they generally spend more time engaged in appropriate tasks. (6) Reductions in class size and increases in time can only produce positive effects if the following also is true: teachers are adaptable and have the skills and motivation to capitalize on these instructions; the material taught and tested fits together; and the strategy for accomplishing the reduced student-instructor ratio creates fewer barriers to learning than it breaks down. A list of reference is appended. (PS)

AB  - Although the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act increased the demand for inclusive settings, students with significant cognitive disabilities (SWSCD) have not always been accepted in regular education settings. SWSCD are students diagnosed with autism, or severe, profound, or moderate intellectual disabilities and sometimes students who are classified as other health impaired. This phenomenological case study was designed to determine problems and concerns that educators had with inclusion and to determine the needs of educators in order to increase opportunities for inclusive environments for SWSCD. The conceptual framework for this study was based on Cooper and Fazio's revision of the theory of cognitive dissonance, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and Bandura's social learning theory. Ten educators, 5 general educators, and 5 special educators at a high school were interviewed to determine their experiences with inclusion and their perceptions on the necessary tools or training for inclusion. Typological style data analysis revealed themes directly related to educators' concerns with inclusion: class size, co-teaching versus collaboration, and teacher training concerning accommodations and modifications. In addition, results indicated general educators lacked experience with SWSCD. This research allowed educators to verbalize their needs and concerns in regards to accommodations/modifications, class size, and collaboration in inclusion. Educators who are better equipped to manage all types of inclusion will contribute to social change by demonstrating acceptance and a sense of belonging within their environment. In turn, this knowledge may improve educators' attitudes and create a community of belonging that may provide for acceptance of all students (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Because at-risk students may feel alienated from school, educational reforms may be useful that make school a more supportive place. While many students identified as "at-risk" may drop out of high school, many others could be better described as "pushouts." These students may desire to stay in school and graduate, but feel pressure to leave. Pregnant students may face covert pressure from school personnel to leave school, attendance policies may prevent them from continuing, and medical and child care problems may prevent their return to school. A look at the dropout rate suggests that the traditional system of education is failing approximately 25% of the school population. The special facilitative school climate offered by alternative schools can improve student self-esteem, reduce the dropout rate, and increase productivity. Self-esteem immersion is considered an important component of many alternative schools. Teacher modeling of appropriate and effective behaviors is another very important component of successful alternative high schools. Strategies for keeping at-risk students in school and for enhancing their self-esteem and academic performance include limiting class sizes, selecting teachers carefully, being flexible, and avoiding the conventional model of school in which rewards and penalties dominate the teacher-student relationship. Teachers in alternative high schools can positively impact at-risk students' self-esteem through facilitative environmental characteristics such as trust, respect, and cooperation. (NB)

AB  - Special education teacher burnout has a negative impact not only on the school district, but also on the outcomes of children with disabilities. Successful special education programs are effective because they are able to retain highly qualified teachers. It is critical to understand what conditions contribute to special education teachers making the choice to not renew their teaching contracts. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to determine if a relationship existed between burnout among special education teachers in South Carolina and six predictor variables. The target population for this study was the 5,757 special education teachers in South Carolina who taught during the 2010-2011 school year. A total of 347 usable surveys, or six percent of the target population, were returned. The quantitative portion was administered via an online survey that contained a researcher-created demographic survey form and the Job Satisfaction Survey. Results indicated that there were no relationship between a special education teacher's job satisfaction and burnout, X2 (1, N = 347) = 1.46. p > .05. Additionally, the results indicated that the variability of job satisfaction, age, gender, years teaching special education, size of caseload, type of classroom setting, and certification status are not predictors of burnout, p > .05. The qualitative portion of the study was conducted through an open-ended question embedded into the online survey. Based on the findings from the qualitative portion of the study, special education teachers who renewed their contact did so because they were either satisfied with their job, passionate about their profession, or ambivalent. Special education teachers who did not renew their contracts did so because either they were involuntarily re-assigned to an unfavorable position, unsatisfied with the amount of paperwork, or did not feel supported by their administrators. These findings support the findings of other studies in the area of special education teacher burnout in that there is no consensus about the relationship between special education teacher characteristics and attrition. Further research should consider incorporating a smaller, more comprehensive qualitative study concentrating on the characteristics of the special education teacher in order to gain a more in-depth insight into the stressors of the special education profession.

AB  - This study detailed the significance of class size on student achievement. The dependent variable represented in this study was AYP (Annual Yearly Progress) cumulative scores of Missouri schools. The dependent variables for this study were class size (student/teacher ratios) of schools in Missouri and socioeconomic status of students in Missouri schools. The intention of this study was to examine the effects of small class assignments, with special attention given to disaggregating the results by economic status, school size, and student achievement scores. Student achievement measures included district's AYP (Annual Yearly Progress) scores for the 2007-2008 school year as reported by DESE. Additional quantitative information was gleaned from the data pertaining to socioeconomic status of students and school size. This study indicated a statistically significant relationship between class size and student achievement. A truism exists in relation to the ability of educators to attend to individual student needs when the class size remains below seventeen. The more individualized attention the student receives the more they will achieve. The findings of this study indicated the need for reduced class size. All quantitative data were represented in a comparison study with the use of a Pearson r correlation coefficient model. The results of this study proved to reject the null hypothesis and set the stage for further study in area of class size and student achievement. Additional information is available in the study regarding the impact of socioeconomic status on student achievement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - To examine the problem of widening gaps in reading achievement between initially low-achieving children and other students as they move through elementary school, the authors first reviewed the literature on school effectiveness. Using a form of systems analysis called "system dynamics," they formulated a model and a set of hypotheses explaining the differences between effective and ineffective schools. Among the variables included are teacher skills and expectations, time factors, instructional intensity and appropriateness, principals' intervention and support, class size, feedback between reading achievement and teacher perceptions of a learning gap, and student behavior, motivation, and aptitude. A survey of educational practitioners' reactions led to adjustments in the model. The authors then constructed a mathematical computer simulation of the model, showing the flow of students through grades 1-6, to test the hypotheses and to evaluate four possible school improvement policies that involve changes in school characteristics, instructional intensity and appropriateness, or student behavior. Based on their results, the authors conclude that ineffective schools can be made effective by increasing teacher skills, raising teacher expectations, and maximizing instructional time. (Author/RW)

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to determine if there was a difference in standardized test scores of third and fourth grade special needs students as measured by New Jersey Assessment Skills and Knowledge (NJ ASK) when small group instruction was implemented with and without in-class-support. There were 64 special needs students who received resource room services with and without the intervention. Twenty students were placed in Group A with intervention and 44 students were placed in Group B without intervention. This study used a quantitative quasi-experimental design to determine the significance of differences in the posttests for Group A and Group B, and the pretest and posttest scores of fourth grade special needs students. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in the special needs students' test scores who received resource room services with and without ICS. In the posttest for the reading domain, Group A's mean score was slightly higher than Group B. In the posttest for analyzing text, Group A's mean score was slightly higher than Group B. In analyzing text, both groups saw a slight improvement between the pretest and posttest scores. This provided some evidence that there was a difference between the groups. Since the results were unexpected and raised interesting questions, which did not support the literature review, it suggested the need for future research. The results of this study indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the NJ ASK posttest scores for third and fourth grade special needs students but provided some slight evidence that there could be a difference. The results suggested future research to determine if there truly was a difference. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Students with Emotional and Behavioural Disorders (EBD) have the poorest academic and social outcomes across the general and special education student populations, and are among the most likely to receive instruction in self-contained special education classrooms hallmarked by small teacher-student ratios, frequent transitions, extreme student behaviours, and the regular presence of multiple adults in the room. These characteristics differentiate the interactions between adults and students occurring in self-contained versus inclusive or general education settings. With the goal of improving outcomes for students with EBD in self-contained classrooms, this study used mixed-methods to examine the psychometric properties of the widely used Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). Results suggest limitations in the applicability of the CLASS for self-contained classrooms.

AB  - This study examined differences in self-determination among students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), students with intellectual disability (ID), and students with learning disabilities (LD). A total of 222 participants with an equal size group for each of the three disability categories were selected to participate in the comparison of total self-determination and domain scores. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed on four dependent variables (DVs)/factors, including autonomy, self-regulation, psychological empowerment, and self-realization. The results indicated that students with ASD had significantly lower levels of autonomy compared with students in either other group; that students with ID had significantly lower levels of self-regulation than students with LD, but not significantly different from students with ASD; that students with ASD and students with ID had significantly lower levels of psychological empowerment than students with LD; and that students with ID had significantly lower levels of self-realization than students with LD, but not significantly different from students with ASD. Suggestions for future research and implications for educators were also discussed.

AB  - Class-size reduction, or CSR, is enormously popular with parents, teachers, and the public in general. Many parents believe that their children will benefit from more individualized attention in a smaller class and many teachers find smaller classes easier to manage. The pupil-teacher ratio is an easy statistic for the public to monitor as a measure of educational quality, especially before test-score data became widely available in the last decade. Policymakers across the nation, including those in at least 24 states, have taken these ideas to heart and enacted CSR initiatives at costs upward of billions of dollars. These policies, coupled with trends in local school districts, have produced a widespread reduction in the number of students per teacher over the past four decades. Parents, teachers, and policymakers have all embraced CSR as a strategy to improve the quality of public education. There is surprisingly little high-quality research, however, on the effects of class size on student achievement in the United States. The credible evidence that does exist is not consistent, and there are many low-quality studies with results all over the map. The evidence on class size indicates that smaller classes can, in some circumstances, improve student achievement if implemented in a focused way. But CSR policies generally take exactly the opposite approach by pursuing across-the-board reductions in class size at the state or federal level. These large-scale, untargeted policies are also extremely expensive and represent wasted opportunities to make smarter educational investments. The fact that across-the-board CSR policies at the state or district level are not cost-effective does not mean that smaller classes should never be used, but rather that they should be reserved for use in special cases by individual schools.

AB  - Numerous scholars contend that students with and without disabilities benefit both socially and academically from inclusive services. Other researchers advocate for educating students with disabilities in self-contained settings. The aim of this article is to compare the literature on the rationale for use of self-contained special education classes with the practices adopted in schools by answering the following research question: What are the social, emotional, and academic experiences of students with disabilities placed in self-contained programs? The findings of this study suggest that the purported rationale for self-contained special education in the literature--issues of community, distraction-free environments, specialized curriculum/instruction, and behavioral supports--were not present in the six observed self-contained settings. Implications for school leaders are discussed and the rationales for the utilization of self-contained classrooms are strongly questioned. (Contains 2 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - Despite escalating special education costs and increasing student needs, policies governing special education caseload remain inconsistent, and implementation is even more variable. This article considers links between a) instructional group size and student engagement, b) caseload and academic achievement, and c) caseload and special education teacher attrition. Findings suggest that a) larger caseloads and instructional group sizes negatively impact student math and reading achievement; b) severity of students' needs sway teacher perceptions of efficacy; c) group or whole class instruction dominates all class sizes, but individualization occurs more frequently in smaller groups; d) student attending behaviors and academic engagement increase when group sizes decrease; and e) high teacher attrition and high caseloads appear correlated. Recommendations for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study addressed the problem of special educator attrition by exploring the impact of administrator behavior on special educator job satisfaction and intent to leave. Study participants were selected from three districts serving K-8th grade students in one geographic region of Southern California. Interviews were held with nineteen special educators to seek information about how they perceive that their site and district administrators affect their job satisfaction or intent to leave. School administrators were interviewed and conversations were held with district special education administrators to seek information about decision-making and power in the organization. Study findings, relative to the common themes shared by special educators, suggest the following: (1) Special educators in this study perceive their district office administrators as better able to mitigate their negative work factors associated with job dissatisfaction than their school site administrators; (2) Decision deprivation of special educators in areas that affect their work lives such as student placement/caseload size, hiring of adequate support staff (psychologists), ability to transfer, and hiring/discipline of paraprofessionals contributes to their job dissatisfaction or intent to leave; (3) Mismatched perceptions of administrator support between special educators and their school site administrators may correspond to job dissatisfaction and/or intent to leave; (4) There seems to be a correspondence between the amount of power and authority the school site administrators believe they have, and their ability to mitigate the negative work factors associated with special educator attrition; (5) Resource specialists seem to receive less support from their district special education administrators than special day class teachers, and in this study, resource specialists more frequently report dissatisfaction than special day class teachers; and (6) Secondary special educators more frequently report they have limited access to their site and district level administrators than elementary special educators, and feel this contributes to their job dissatisfaction or intent to leave. Implications for practice and further research are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Questionnaires were completed by 85 high school administrators, 87 high school special education teachers, and 103 general education teachers; and interviews were conducted with 48 special education students. Data are presented according to each sample group. Special education teachers responded to questions on such issues as courses taught, program effectiveness, desired class size, and specific strategies within the district related to mainstreaming. General education teachers voiced their perceptions of mainstreaming success, adequacy of support services, need for extra time to accommodate mainstreamed handicapped students, and effects of mainstreamed students on quality of instruction. Administrators responded to questions regarding their degree of responsibility in high school special education programs, time devoted to special education activities, and ranking of inservice topics. Students were asked about their experiences in regular classrooms, difficulties with other students, and suggestions to improve the special education program. Nine conclusions were drawn including the need for increased training in high school teaching for special education teachers assigned to high school positions, the importance of written goals and objectives for the secondary special education program, and the role of special education teachers in facilitating the acceptance of mainstreamed students. (Sample questionnaires are appended). (CL)

AB  - Examined reasons for leaving, occupations subsequently chosen, and distinctions between disgruntled and nondisgruntled leavers among special education teachers. Phone interviews were conducted with 93 randomly selected Florida special education teachers (mean age 36.3 yrs) who left the classroom. Results indicated that the largest portion of teachers who leave the classroom do so because they are dissatisfied with conditions of work, including overwhelming workload, class size, student behavior, diverse learning needs, insufficient administrative support, and lack of personnel and material resources. The largest category of leavers were disgruntled, and the majority of leavers remained in education. The largest portion of leavers said that there were no incentives that would encourage them to return to the special education classroom. The authors discuss implications for the special education field and make suggestions for retaining teachers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study explores two teachers' beliefs and literacy instruction in self-contained classrooms with adolescents identified with emotional and behavioral disorders. Data are presented from participant observations and interviews collected over a three-month period in two middle school classrooms. Qualitative analysis investigates the literacy instructional activities the two teachers used and those teachers' beliefs and rationales for using those activities. Themes regarding instructional participation structures and teachers' beliefs are presented in addition to the interaction patterns that occur within those participation structures. The use of mediated social interaction and meaningful activities during instruction as well as the congruence between teachers' beliefs and practices are discussed. Findings are also discussed regarding the continued struggle between managing student behavior and implementing rigorous.

AB  - This final report on the California Class Size Reduction (CSR) initiative summarizes findings from three earlier reports dating back to 1997. Chapter 1 recaps the history of California's CSR initiative and includes a discussion of what state leaders' expectations were when CSR was passed. The chapter also describes research on class-size reduction that has been conducted elsewhere. Chapter 2 presents findings from previous CSR evaluations in California and relates these findings to program implementation issues, parent support, relationship of CSR to academic achievement, changes in teacher qualifications, teaching practices and resource issues, and the effect of CSR on the identification of special-education students. Chapter 3 asks what policy implications might be drawn from the research and how CSR fits into the larger context of standards-based education reform in California. The report provides the following major findings: implementation of CSR occurred rapidly, though it lagged in schools serving minority and low-income students; the relationship of CSR to student achievement was inconclusive; CSR was associated with declines in teacher qualifications and a less-equitable distribution of credentialed teachers; CSR had a modest effect on teacher mobility; implementation did not affect special-education identification or placement; and parents liked reduced-size classes.

AB  - The study analyzed data concerning students enrolled in special education classes in Alabama's 130 (67 county and 63 city) public school systems, including student counts by age, grade in school, school district, type of exceptionality, and personnel needs. Analysis indicated a considerable variation among school systems in the distribution of exceptionality types, the proportion of special education students at different age and grade levels, teacher/pupil ratios in special education classes, and the reported need for additional special education teachers. Possible causes for these differences may include random variations, referral patterns, a shortage of well-trained administrators and teachers, community pressures, and discrepancies in classification procedures according to race. The major demographic correlates of general rates of exceptionality included population growth, employment in selected white-collar occupations, income, and residence in urban locales--all of which were found to be positively associated with both the rate of exceptionality and the teacher/pupil ratio. The proportions of the population classified as "black" or residing in urban areas were also highly correlated with several specific categories of exceptionality. Results have implications for testing procedures and interpretation as well as implementation of policy guidelines for placement of students in special education programs. (DB)

AB  - • Current understanding of class size limited to Western countries. • This special section extends understanding of class size effects. • Introduces new studies of class size effects in Europe. • Introduces new studies of classroom processes related to class size. • Introduces new studies on professional development to support class size changes. Debate about class sizes in schools is long standing and contentious. In this review we show much research is limited and outdated, with an exclusive concern with pupil academic outcomes. This Special Section seeks to extend the literature on class size in two ways. First, it addresses what goes on in classrooms which might account for any effects found, and it also examines professional development approaches to making the most of teaching opportunities afforded by class size. Second, it reflects the shift of research on class size from the USA and the UK to elsewhere in Europe and in East Asia. This Section aims to provide a timely and significant advance on the rather tired debate over class size.

AB  - The inclusion of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in mainstream schools can result in difficult decisions regarding classroom organisation and management. The premise of this article is that these are likely to be affected by the classroom context, specifically the number of pupils in the class, the size and composition of groups and classes, and the presence of additional adults, but that there is very little systematic information on these features. A systematic observation study was conducted involving 48 pupils at Year 5 (9-10 years) and 49 pupils at Year 9 (13-14 years) with Statements of SEND, along with 115 comparison pupils at Year 5 and 112 at Year 9 who were typically developing. There were nearly 70,000 observations (data points) in total. Results showed that pupils at Year 5 with SEN were being taught in larger classes than at Year 9, and that, compared with typically developing pupils, they were much more likely to be separately taught in small, low-attaining groups at Year 5 and small, low-attaining classes (sets) at secondary. The study raises worrying questions about the appropriateness of classroom contexts for pupils with SEND and the heavy reliance on teaching assistants.

AB  - Differentiated instruction (DI) research has shown many benefits of implementing instructional practices within an inclusive classroom. However, many teachers do not utilize this instructional practice regularly. An instrumental qualitative case study design that included teachers from one middle school in a rural school district in a southeastern state was used in this study to explore rural middle school teachers' experiences with incorporating the components of DI to support special education students in an inclusion classroom. The challenges faced when incorporating DI were also examined. Tomlinson's model of differentiated instruction framed this study, as it explores the need for teachers to provide responsive instruction to meet the needs of each of their students, regardless of a student's ability. A purposeful sample of 10 middle school teachers' Grades 6–8 from various content areas participated in an interview, an instructional observation, and submitted documents for review. Inductive analysis was used to analyze data of teacher use of DI components, and hand-coding was used to identify emerging thematic relationships and patterns. When asked about incorporating the components of DI to support special education students within an inclusion-based classroom, participants revealed concerns with class size, lack of resources, knowledge/preparation, and professional development. Based on the results, a 3 full day program was created as a project to incorporate DI into improve middle school inclusion-based classrooms for all content teachers. The program may contribute to positive social change by helping middle school teachers use the components of DI in their inclusion-based classes providing support to increase academic success for special education students.

AB  - Teachers face numerous challenges. Pressure exists to meet Common Core Standards and increase state test scores while operating on shoestring budgets. In addition, public schools have seen an increase in students with disabilities—individuals with unique academic and social needs. Due to the Education for all Handicapped Children Act of 1975, inclusion in general education classrooms is the right of children with disabilities. Disability advocates applaud this act for ensuring equality for all. Yet, equality is not akin to equity. In classrooms where teachers lack proper training, children with special needs may not experience equity, ultimately weakening the intent of inclusive practices. The current study stems from a commissioned needs assessment that explored how teachers at two elementary schools in Northeast Ohio define inclusion, current training related to students with disabilities, and teacher recommendations for training/resources to teach students with special needs effectively. The article ends with policy and future research recommendations.

AB  - Abstract. Educators often assume that the self-concept of children with learning disabilities (LD) is less favorable than that of children without LD. The present study, a meta-analysis of 61 studies of self-concept, was conducted to examine this assumption. Results showed that children with LD perceived their academic ability less favorably than their non-LD peers. In other domains of self-concept, however, group differences were less clear. In contrast to a previous meta-analysis (Chapman, 1988), the results of this study indicated no differences in self-concept as a function of special education setting. Implications for research and practice in school psychology are discussed.

AB  - This report describes a province-wide study in Alberta (Canada) to explore the integration of students with special needs. In Phase 1 (1991-92) of the study, a telephone survey of all superintendents was conducted to provide an overview of integration practices. In Phase 2 (1992), a mail survey of superintendents and their special education designates examined the nature and extent of integration practices in further depth. Phase 3 involved development of six case studies of schools through on-site observation; document review; and staff, parent, and student interviews. The project produced a list of critical integration factors divided into 4 jurisdictional and 15 school-based factors. Jurisdictional factors include adequate physical resources, adequate human resources, adequate training for regular classroom teachers, and a written policy on integration. School-based factors include, among others, principal support/involvement, parent involvement, written policy/mission statement, formal communications systems, reduced class size where special needs students are present, planning time for integration, and preparation of regular and special needs students for integration. Individual chapters of the report provide background information, report the findings of Phases 1 and 2, present the case studies of Phase 3, and offer a cross-case analysis. A final chapter presents conclusions (noting the frequency of occurrence of each of the critical integration factors) and recommendations. The survey instruments and interview formats are appended.

AB  - With the major policy shift towards inclusive education internationally, this paper examines the ongoing expansion of special classes in Irish primary and second-level schools. Using data from a mixed-methods longitudinal study on special classes, we examine if special classes are operating as a form of segregation or inclusion for children with special educational needs. The findings suggest that special classes only operate as a unit of inclusion where children have severe needs. For children with moderate or mild needs, the findings are less clear with some classes operating as a segregated setting or low stream class with no official sanction resulting in issues around teacher competency and stigma among students.

AB  - Current evidence is equivocal as to whether special needs students experience a superior education in an inclusive or a non-inclusive environment. The National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) standards state that children should not be given extra-class placements for special services unless (a) they can be accurately classified and (b) special placement demonstrates superior results. The purpose of this study is to provide high-quality, quantitative evidence concerning the effectiveness of non-inclusive educational practices on the academic and social outcomes of special needs students when compared to similar outcomes generated from inclusive educational practices for United States students during the time period 1983-1992. Meta-analytic methodology developed by Hedges was used in this study. The benefits gained by using this method are substantial in that (a) one can calculate H which determines whether the individual d values differ by more than sampling error, and (b) one can compute statistical tests of significance (i.e., t-test) since the standard error of the effect size estimate d. is known. A final sample of 13 studies met the relevant inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis. These studies produced 129 comparisons (i.e., effect sizes). The results of the present study used the comparison as the unit of analysis. The mean overall effect size estimate d. was -5 for the full sample and -4 for the trimmed sample (experimental group is the non-inclusive condition). These estimates were statistically different from the no effect condition. The mean academic (d. = -8) and mean social (d. = -8) effect size estimates were also statistically significant. Furthermore, these results did not appear to vary across (a) grade level, (b) subject area, or (c) type of special needs students. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that special needs students in non-inclusive educational programs do not outperform special needs students in inclusive progr (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Summarizes recent research concerning inclusion's (generally positive) effects on student learning and social relations with classmates. Three meta-analyses address the most-effective-setting issue by generating a common measure, an effect size. These effect sizes demonstrate a small-to-moderate beneficial influence of inclusive education on special-needs children' academic and social outcomes. (11 references) (MLH)

AB  - Profiles teachers' everyday experiences at a southeastern Texas middle school that mainstreams most of its special needs students. Classroom observations, accompanied by teacher and student survey data, showed that mainstreaming had deleterious effects. Since teachers spent a disproportionate amount of time serving special education students, regular students received less individual assistance, parent-teacher contacts, and lesson preparation time.

AB  - Conducted a meta-analysis of 23 studies of the effects of special, homogeneous classes vs regular, heterogeneous classes on achievement and nonachievement outcomes of gifted students (GSTs). GSTs in special classes achieved more than their gifted counterparts in regular classes, with the greatest advantage being on science and social science tests. The advantage for GSTs in special classes was larger at higher grade levels. There were no differences in measures of self-concept, but the GSTs in regular classes had more positive attitudes toward peers. The magnitude of the effects were questionable because the effect sizes were influenced largely by the number of variables used to match the GSTs in the 2 classroom frameworks.

AB  - This study investigated concepts of inclusive education for pupils with autism in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Palestine. The "contextual collaborative enquiry" methodology was rooted in praxis, and drew on social learning theory and communities of practice to gather a community of researchers, parents and practitioners in Palestine to investigate understandings of autism educational practice in order to identify how to move practice forward. Through mixed methods, we interviewed a purposive sample of key people (n = 19) to gain access to a broad range of perspectives on the research topic; visited centres of provision for children with special needs (n = 6) and other specialist settings (n = 8); and ran a two-day interactive and dialogic workshop with staff (n = 40) from the special needs department of the Ministry of Education. Through a rigorous Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of interviews, field notes, questionnaires and focus groups, we found that the biggest obstacles to inclusion were stigma, lack of knowledge and poor diagnostic practices, coupled with a rigid education system and an absence of shared understanding of what inclusion might mean for Palestine. There were gaps between beliefs in social justice and the concrete reality of including children with autism. Despite obstacles and barriers to inclusion, participants were passionate about gaining new knowledge, adopting different pedagogies and enabling inclusion. These findings are significant as they highlight that a push towards more inclusive practices through social learning approaches could be a powerful driver in mounting a challenge to the inflexibility within the current education system in Palestine.

AB  - Recent evaluations of Federal compensatory education programs funded by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, Title I, and maintained by the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981, Chapter 1, point to qualified effectiveness in the targeting of services, program structures, and classroom arrangements for increasing the academic achievement of educationally disadvantaged students. The poverty status of the school should be considered as the first criterion for targeting services and then students' achievement, although most districts further target resources to elementary school students. The smaller class size used in compensatory education classrooms has been strongly linked to increased achievement, but the effectiveness of the extended periods of compensatory instructional time are less certain. The homogeneous grouping employed in instructional groups is considered detrimental to low-ability students; cooperative learning techniques can be more effective. Evaluations of both Title I and Chapter 1 services demonstrate that the academic achievement of participants in Title I and Chapter 1 programs improved, but the gap between compensatory education students and regular students widened with grade level. Suggested policy changes in Chapter 1 include the following: (1) concentrate and sustain funding in fewer schools in the poorest neighborhoods; (2) permit school-based allocation of funding; and (3) incorporate services more fully into the overall instructional program and keep students in smaller regular classrooms. A list of 17 references is appended. (FMW)

AB  - Researchers and educators have begun to question whether Chapter 1 pull-out programs are the most effective method of delivering extra help to the students who need it. Pull-out programs are still the predominating type, but may be declining in popularity as in-class programs gain favor. This document summarizes a variety of program designs which are used nation-wide to provide Chapter 1 services to students. They are the following: (1) pull-out programs which provide instruction outside of the classroom and have advantages and disadvantages to student achievement and school organization; (2) add-on programs which take place beyond the regular instructional times and may cause difficulties in scheduling and transportation; (3) in-class instruction in which there is usually a Chapter 1 specialist along with the regular teacher in the students' classroom; and (4) replacement programs which provide Chapter 1 students with separate classes for all of the instruction they are to receive in a given subject and which reduce the class size for regular teachers in some areas of instruction. Research has suggested some more effective methods, but national, state, and local laws impede the success and flexibility of service delivery. A list of eight references is included. (VM)

AB  - The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 is based on the principle that setting high academic expectations and establishing measurable goals can improve individual outcomes in education. Under NCLB, states are required to develop assessments in basic skills to be given to all students in certain grades if those states are to receive federal funding for schools. The purpose of this study was to determine if reduced inclusion class sizes affect student's scores on the Assessment of Skills and Knowledge (ASK) test administered in one northeastern US state and to solicit teachers' opinions of smaller class sizes. Inclusions classes are those that enroll special needs students. Theoretical foundations guiding this study included social learning theory, constructivist theory, and the cooperative learning theory. The key question this study focused on was whether or not smaller class size has an effect on academic achievement for special needs inclusion students. Using archival data, this ex post facto study found a statistically significant difference using a MANOVA, F(2,34) = 14.55, p less than 0.0001 for the research question investigating the effect class size has on special needs inclusion students. Positive social change implications include helping inform the efforts of local, state, and federal education officials to narrow the achievement gap between regular and special education students. These results could provide justification to school boards for hiring more staff, creating and passing building addition referendums, and providing professional development to identify ways to adjust school schedules and reduce class size.

AB  - A review of the literature on compensatory education programs was conducted to determine the effects of their following design features: (1) instructional setting; (2) class size; (3) ability grouping; and (4) various types of instructors. Remedial instruction in reading, language arts, and mathematics for elementary school students was emphasized. Findings and recommendations include the following: (1) instructional setting is not directly related to student outcomes, so local conditions should determine whether an in-class or pull-out approach is used; (2) while it is clear that teachers need help in meeting the needs of the disadvantaged, there does not seem to be an optimal combination of instructional specialists, aides, or other teachers, so assignments should be based on staff competencies and student needs; and (3) small classes of 15 or fewer heterogeneously grouped students are preferred. One table illustrating the results of the Various Perspectives on the Pull-out Findings of the Instructional Dimensions Study is included. A 16-page list of references is also included. (FMW)

AB  - Drawing on data collected during the Title I Demonstration Study, this report describes the extent to which Title I programs "expand and improve" the Title I student's regular curriculum. Background information is provided through an overview and discussion of the Title I legal framework and its effects on service delivery. A comparison of Title I and non-Title I services focuses on language arts instruction delivered at the elementary grade level. Taken into consideration is the amount and nature of Title I instruction. The influence of variables such as group size, type of instructor, degree of individualization, and location of instruction on student achievement, particularly in compensatory education programs, is examined. The basic conclusion reached is that districts can both comply with Federal laws and regulations and still provide services which do not necessarily "expand and improve" the regular curriculum. (EB)

AB  - The Wiley and Harnischfeger school effects model treats quantity of instruction as a predictor of school performance. Despite the importance of the model for the study of school and program effects, including the incremental effects (if any) of Title I and other compensatory efforts, very little information is available on its practical application. Further, with or without the benefit of the model, little is known about the amounts and kinds of instructional services students actually receive in today's schools, either through locally or State supported regular instructional programs or Federally supported Title I programs. The research described in this document provides information in both of these areas. It includes a brief description of an instrument designed to obtain quantity and quality of schooling data, presents descriptive information about the amounts and kinds of services which various types of students receive, and addresses the following questions: (l) What amounts and kinds of services are actually delivered in today's elementary schools? (2) To what extent and in what way(s) does classroom instruction received by Title I students differ from that received by other students? (3) Does the amount of noncompensatory instruction received by Title I students appear to be related to the amount of compensatory instruction received? and (4) Does the delivery of compensatory services to Title I students differ in terms of group size and type of instruction from the delivery of noncompensatory services to these same students?

AB  - Under the Universal Primary Education (UPE) programme in Uganda, which was implemented in 1997, the idea of integrated education was put into practice. Today children with disabilities are enrolled in regular primary schools in the whole country. After three years of experience with UPE, the aim of this study was to examine the views of teachers about their needs for training and support regarding the task of teaching children with disabilities in ordinary classrooms. A qualitative approach was chosen using individual interviews, focus group discussions with teachers, pupils and head teachers, and observations in classrooms. Three primary schools in different districts of Uganda were selected as research sites. For a number of reasons data collection from the pupils proved problematic but generally the findings confirmed the information drawn from the review of literature. In addition to the high teacher-pupil ratio, there is an alarming lack of resources in the schools and an urgent need for teacher training to meet special needs in the classroom. Despite these difficult conditions found in schools, many teachers had positive attitudes towards integrating children with disabilities, but only a few examples from the classroom observations showed good practice for meeting a diversity of needs.

AB  - The developing trend toward mainstreaming combined with increasing class size and decreasing numbers of teaching positions demands the creation of new kinds of educational programs for troubled children. A model that is based on ecological theory and on community education is described and some significant differences between special education and community special education are noted. Finally, major implications of the proposed model for training, research, and classroom and school operations are presented.

AB  - Although residential school characteristics (e.g., smaller class sizes, the availability of remedial education, student-centered curricula, flexible scheduling) are tailored to better support students with challenges (Kleiner et al., 2002), these modifications alone may not be enough to improve the challenging behaviors that students in residential schools often present. Consequently, many students in residential schools, particularly those with EBD, experience a number of negative postschool outcomes (e.g., unemployment, health issues, decreased community involvement, entanglement with criminal justice system; Christle, Jolivette, & Nelson, 2007). However, educators may address the various challenges and needs of students in residential schools by effectively identifying and implementing evidence-based practices to reduce problem behaviors. Two such practices are described herein--CICO (check in/check out) and SDLMI (self-determined learning model of instruction) instruction. CICO is a teacher- or mentor-directed intervention that is implemented through a five-step process (i.e., check-in, receiving feedback, check-out, home component, return to school) and has been used to positively move students toward meeting schoolwide or individual goals (Maggin et al., 2015). The SDLMI (Wehmeyer, Palmer, Agran, Mithaug, & Martin, 2000) is a three-phase instructional model that requires students to respond to a series of problem-solving questions that serve to help them set self-selected goals and create plans to attain those goals (Kelly & Shogren, 2014). Combining well-grounded evidence-based practices is an effective strategy to address and remediate behavior, given that no single practice will address all the needs of all students with EBD (Cook, Tankersley, & Harjusola-Webb, 2008).

AB  - Mandates of the 2001 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and 2004 reauthorization of IDEA have accelerated the movement toward inclusion making it imperative that students with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum taught by highly qualified teachers to the maximum extent possible (Friend, 2006). The Iowa Department of Education introduced the consultative (co-teaching) model (2006) as one means for fulfilling the NCLB requirement that all students be taught by highly qualified teachers. This study examined the level of implementation of the components Iowa Department of Education’s consultative (co-teaching) model by Iowa high schools and the teacher and administrative factors influencing this implementation. Student achievement levels among high and low implementing schools were analyzed to determine the effect of the implementation of the consultative (co-teaching) model on the high schools’ ability to meet performance targets. A survey instrument was used to collect quantitative data. Written comments from survey participants and focus group interviews with special and general education coteachers provided qualitative data. The study consisted of a sample population of 100 randomly and purposively selected high schools of which 55 participated representing 15% of Iowa high schools. A total of 242 special and general education co-teachers completed the survey. Three high schools were purposively selected for focus group interviews from survey participants. Quantitative results indicated and qualitative data supported (to a lesser extent) that Iowa high schools were implementing four of the five components of the co-teaching model these included: philosophy, individual prerequisites, professional relationships, and classroom dynamics. The fifth component, external supports, was the least implemented component. Separate Pearson’s coefficient alpha correlation tests found teacher and administrative factors were significantly correlated with the implementation of the co-teaching model. Separate independent t tests were applied to 2006-07 and 2007-08 ITED achievement data. Results indicated no significant effect of the implementation of the coteaching model on reading comprehension and math student achievement of 11th grade students with disabilities between high and low implementing high schools. Sample size and early implementation may have limited the power to detect statistical significance. The significance of the study will assist local, state, and national educational leaders as they lead the implementation of inclusive practices and strive to meet state and federal performance goals. Results will assist the Iowa Department of Education and Great Prairie AEA in planning for statewide and area professional development to support co-teachers.

AB  - The article discusses problems faced by mentally retarded children. The problem of the mentally retarded children in the public schools is one that cannot be escaped. The mentally retarded who have been trained and who have found their place in the world and are properly adjusted to it can and do make a contribution to society. Those not trained, not adjusted, find their way to the courts or to correctional institutions. In spite of the State laws directing the establishment of special classes for the mentally retarded there is a wide gap between the need and the performance. It is evident, on the basis of the known number of mentally retarded children, that comparatively few are receiving special class instruction. The grouping together of all sizes, ages of mentally retarded children is considered poor educational policy. Special education in any given city should grow until it is in a position to train and educate all the feeble-minded and subnormal children in that city, including the provision for the education of the borderline subnormal children.

AB  - The "regular education initiative," whose chief proponent is Assistant Secretary of Education Madeleine Will, calls for the merger of special education and regular education into one system. It is based on the Adaptive Learning Environment Model (ALEM) developed by Margaret Wang and her associates. This paper reviews the research, including pilot studies, conducted by Wang and others in order to aid regular and special educators in assessing the regular education initiative. It concludes that the ALEM may provide effective mainstreaming technology, but that the research examined does not necessarily verify it. ALEM appears to be a highly implementable model of effective teaching in a regular classroom setting with average learners through second grade, but the research has not: (1) demonstrated effectiveness of ALEM with learners defined as "handicapped" under PL 94-142, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act; (2) investigated setting as a variable and therefore shown it as more effective than resource or other special-setting classes; (3) investigated the variance gained or maintained past grade 2; (4) investigated variance accounted for by level of task difficulty or use of self-instructional materials; or (5) always employed the best research practices in terms of statistical analysis, control groups, and sample size. A 34-item reference list is appended. (VW)

AB  - The implementation of the No Child Left Behind accountability process has allowed schools to fail to report academic progress for significant groups of students. This study examined the impact of No Child Left Behind on accountability for special education students in small rural schools within a state. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data to explore current practice compared with intent of the law. The results indicate that many schools are not held accountable for achievement of special education students; these students fall through the "accountability cracks" or fissures in the implementation procedures. In addition, suggestions and recommendations are presented.

AB  - Evaluated an alternative high school that has been successful in getting dropouts to return to school and remain until graduation. The study measured changes in attendance, achievement, and self-esteem in 38 students during the spring semester and 38 students during the fall semester (mean age 16.9 yrs). Documentation of the alternative school program was accomplished via extensive observation at the school interviews with teachers, students, parents, and others and a review of documents concerning the school. The Self Esteem Index and Test of Adult Basic Education were administered to all applicants at the time they were interviewed. T-test results on pre/post test comparisons using tests of Adult Basic Education were inconsistent for the spring and fall groups. The study concluded that the unique characteristics of the school which made it a conducive learning environment particularly included small class size and student body, family atmosphere, on-site infant care, and special teacher training.

AB  - Surveyed 449 3rd-grade elementary school teachers to determine their perceptions of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) regarding barriers to instruction, self-efficacy in working effectively with ADHD students, and confidence in attaining educational goals, focusing on amount of teacher training and experience teaching ADHD students. Four barriers were consistently rated as most serious by the teachers: time to administer specialized interventions, lack of training, class size, and severity of problems. No differences were found between teachers with or without prior training in ADHD, except for perceived confidence in attaining instructional goals. Teaching experience indicated differences between barrier ratings; however, training did not. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The perceptions of 355 principals, regular classroom teachers, and special education teachers regarding the extent of implementation of administrative practices pertaining to the mainstreaming of mildly handicapped children in Mississippi were studied. The results indicated that the first year of mainstreaming in Mississippi saw only moderate implementation of administrative practices considered essential to effective mainstreaming programs. Analysis identified three areas where the perceptions of the three groups of professionals were not congruent (whether or not the principal should become cognizant of the characteristics of mildly handicapped children, whether or not community resources should be utilized in exceptional child education, and whether or not teachers should be encouraged to educate children about handicaps), thus indicating a need for cooperative planning in developing a rationale for mainstreaming mildly handicapped children in the years ahead.

AB  - This dissertation focused on studying ways in which a mandated professional development policy influenced teachers' professional learning within a special education school and within a single collaborative teacher team. The study explored Advance, the teacher evaluation system introduced by the NYCDOE to support teaching and learning. An emphasis of the research was utilizing video as a professional learning tool to gather specific evidence in conjunction with the Danielson Framework for Teaching to support teachers of students with disabilities. The primary methodology driving the study was case study; however, ethnography and action research were used for data collection analysis. Video proved to be useful in supporting teachers learning as it provided the 'professional vision' which allowed teachers to 'notice and interpret significant events' that took place in one teacher's classroom. This study makes it clear that the framework is, indeed, not a one-size-fits-all tool to guide the evaluation process and professional development of teachers. However, the framework can be used to inform classroom practices and provide teaching and learning language to guide feedback even within special education classrooms. The possible examples provided under the current evaluative mechanism does not provide relevant supports for classrooms with students with disabilities (SWD). This study points to the knowledge gaps amongst school leaders who work with teachers of students with disabilities and who apply the framework. Among the key claims that this study makes about video as a professional learning tool are that it presents opportunities to (1) facilitate discourse in a collaborative team, (2) identify problems of practice, (3) define possible examples specific to special education classrooms, and (4) provide the teachers a lens through which to see their own practices.

AB  - The National Association for Sport and Physical Education (NASPE) recommends that the size of physical education class be consistent with those of other subject areas (e.g. maximum 1:25 for ES, 1:30 for MS, 1:35 for HS) for safe and effective instruction. When students with special needs are included in regular physical education classes, their placement should not cause an appropriate class size to be exceeded. Without a doubt, many physical education teachers today face class sizes larger than this (40+ students is not uncommon) and other similar situations like multiple classes sharing one activity space. This document was prepared to assist NASPE workshop participants and physical educators to work with this difficult situation while advocating for recommended class size. (Contains 5 resources.)

AB  - This document suggests changes to the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) in four targeted areas. Regarding Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP), The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) supports: (1) Setting challenging but demonstrably attainable student progress goals; (2) Judging school effectiveness by measuring progress of the same students over time; (3) Producing accurate accountability decisions; (4) Maintaining achievement reporting by subgroup; and (5) Ensuring that AYP requirements and regulations meet scientifically-based standards. To address staff quality issues, AFT advocates: (1) Development of high-caliber teacher induction systems; (2) Ongoing, job-specific professional development for paraprofessionals; (3) Incentive grants to develop peer assistance programs focusing in knowledge and skill improvement; (4) Competitive base pay and benefits with opportunities to improve salary through additional responsibilities; and (5) Development of accountability indices to attract and retain high-quality staff. In the area of school improvement, AFT is lobbying Congress to amend NCLB to ensure that school improvement: (1) Is based on credible identification data; (2) Has adequate support for intensive planning when a school is identified as "in need of improvement"; (3) Provides necessary resources to implement the plan and see results within 3 years; (4) Implement choice and supplemental service only if the improvement plan has been demonstrated to be ineffective after 3 years; and (5) Requires significant restructuring if school does not demonstrate measurable improvement. The final area discussed in this document is sufficient funding of Title I programs to: (1) lower class size; (2) Hire specialists in reading and math instruction to provide teachers with model lessons and in-class training in research-based instructional techniques; and (3) Create faculty workrooms with high-speed Internet connections so that teachers can make use of the broadest array of resources when planning lessons.

AB  - Guidelines for effective public elementary education are proposed by the American Federation of Teachers. The first recommendation concerns the expansion of early childhood education, including pre-kindergarten. Early childhood education should be characterized by small class groups, parent education and involvement, availability of a clinical team of professionals, carefully trained teachers and paraprofessionals, and separate housing facilities. The desirability of school integration is emphasized, with heterogeneous class groups based on sex, class, race, ethnicity, achievements, and adjustment suggested, Special school services to meet the dental, nutritional, medical, social, and emotional needs of children are encouraged. The importance of adequate funding for educational tools and supplies, and for the hiring of auxiliary assistants to release teachers from non-professional duties is discussed. Expanded cooperation between public school and local universities in staff training is proposed. Also noted are the importance of democratic staff involvement in decision-making policy, and the need for research by teachers and outside evaluative agencies. Finally, the cost of implementation of these guidelines is estimated at $450-600 per child, per year. It is argued that improved education will reduce the need for expensive corrective programs. (DP)

AB  - The More Effective Schools Program was designed to prevent academic failure of disadvantaged urban children by focusing on their basic language and mathematics problems. It attempted to improve the quality of a traditional educational program through reducing the pupil-teacher ratio; offering more small-group and individualized instruction; providing remedial, tutorial, and enrichment instruction; extending instruction to prekindergarten and after school periods; and encouraging teachers to employ innovative methods such as team teaching. In addition to administrative personnel, the staff includes guidance counselors, psychologists, social workers, attendance teachers, psychiatrists, speech improvement teachers, community relations coordinators, classroom teachers, special teachers, and secretaries. When taking into account the effects of student attrition, the program does show benefits for the participants, although the superiority of program children over control groups has typically been quite small. Data from several evaluations support the conclusion that the program has been modestly successful in raising student achievement. (LH)

AB  - The More Effective Schools project, an effort to make the schools better able to solve the basic reading and arithmetic problems of disadvantaged children, brought about a reorganization and expansion of the teaching and administrative staffs of elementary schools in New York City. The combined black and Puerto Rican population in the project schools was greater than 50 percent of the total school population, and all classes (preK-6) were heterogeneously grouped. Class size was reduced, after school study centers were opened, team teaching and other innovations were introduced, and teacher specialists were used. Benefits claimed in reading and arithmetic achievement as measured by standardized tests are conflicting because of the variety of designs used to evaluate student performance. Several interpretations of the data are included in this report, as well as information on staff, program methodology, and costs. (EF)

AB  - An increase in the prevalence rate of autism is not necessarily matched by a concurrent increase in the rate of highly qualified special education teachers. The low ratio of highly qualified teachers to the number of students with autism has resulted in chronic teacher shortages in this area. Alternative certification is used as a mechanism to alleviate the demand for highly qualified teachers in special education. However, alternative certification routes have often left novice teachers underprepared for teaching students with autism, more specifically in the implementation of evidence-based practices necessary for instructional effectiveness. The purposes of the study were: a) to assess the knowledge of novice alternatively certified (AC) teachers in the area of autism education; and b) to determine the extent to which age, credit hours of instruction, formal hours of instruction, amount of professional development, and number of students with autism predict the variance in knowledge scores. Participants included all novice (i.e., first-and second-year) alternatively certified special education teachers in the state of Texas. Data were collected through an electronic survey instrument disseminated state-wide to approximately 33 individuals. Multiple regression was conducted in order to determine the strongest predictors of autism knowledge scores. In addition, a multi-way ANOVA was performed to identify differences between groups. The largest predictor of knowledge of autism was hours engaged in self-directed learning. Overall, AC programs in Texas need to provide basic and core content in the area of autism to increase the knowledge of novice teachers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

O estudo foi desenvolvido num agrupamento de escolas no Norte do País, com um grupo de dez professores com vasta experiência de ensino na área da especialização (Educação Especial). O principal instrumento de recolha de dados foi a entrevista semi-estruturada, com recurso à técnica de análise de conteúdo para a análise de dados. Os entrevistados consideraram este modelo de ADD essencialmente dirigido para o controlo e a prestação de contas e manifestaram descrença no valor formativo deste processo, porque não permitirá encontrar caminhos adequados a um desenvolvimento profissional sustentado mas, preferencialmente, responder ao desígnio económico de quanto vale o que fazemos? //ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: This paper presents some results of a qualitative research for which the main purpose was to understand how teachers have organized themselves to respond to the normative requirements of the new model of teachers' performance evaluation (TPE). The study was carried out in a Basic School in the north of Portugal, with a group of ten teachers with a vast teaching experience in their area of expertise (special education). The main instrument for data collection was the semi-structured interview, using the content analysis for data analysis. The interviewees have deemed this TPE model essentially directed toward control and accountability and expressed skepticism in the training value of this process, because it will not allow the discovery of appropriate paths for a sustainable professional development, but it will preferably answer the economical rationale of how much is what we do worth?

AB  - Although Saudi Arabia has an inclusive classroom for students with learning disabilities (LDs) the general education teachers are not prepared to handle the special needs of the students with LDs. This study examined attitude, knowledge of evidence based practices, and perceived skills among the male general education teachers' teachers regarding LDs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia using a mixed method study. Principals were also interviewed to corroborate data. Two-hundred and seventy-eight general education teachers participated on the online survey administered via Qualtrics and ten principals were interviewed in this study. The survey instrument was analyzed for validity and reliability. More than half the teachers currently had or previously had students with LDs. Teacher preparation, academic climate, teaching approaches, teaching strategies and teacher effectiveness were themes that emerged from factor analysis. The ANOVA test identified statistically significant relationships between-years of experience, degree field, and expertise in special education. The degree field, route of certification, expertise in special education, and having students with LDs in classroom was related to the teaching strategy employed by teachers. Teacher effectiveness was related to degree field, with expertise in special education and also with if they have had students with LDs. The academic climate in schools was enhanced by the presence of resource room. General education teachers had a positive attitude towards inclusion and provide multiple strategies for accommodating students with learning disabilities. Class size was considered critical by most general teachers when inclusion was being provided. Principals interviewed in this study reported that teachers had negative attitudes towards inclusion of students with LDs and believed that instructing students with LDs was no different from teaching regular students. Teachers desired smaller class sizes when they had students with LDs in their classrooms. Teachers who were currently were having students with LDs in the classroom requested more information on specialized teaching strategies, ways to individualize their instruction, and more information about accommodations to the curriculum. Teachers certified by traditional routes, requested more training regarding special education laws, asked for more information about accommodations to the curriculum, and sought more assistance in the classroom.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to carry out a systematic review of literature of effective reading intervention for students with -- intellectual disabilities (ID), intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), and multiple disabilities (MD). Findings and recommendations for future research are discussed. Background and rationale: For students with ID, IDD, and MD ability to read can lead to a better quality of life and better integration into the mainstream society. Several studies have expressed a concern over more emphasis placed on social, personal, and vocational skills for individuals with ID, IDD, and MD than on reading and literacy learning. Having a repertoire of effective interventions carried out with this population will help teachers, teacher educators, and anyone else working with the individuals. Method: This study synthesized findings from previous research with 167 students with ID, IDD, and/or MD to assess effectiveness of instruction for key elements of effective reading instruction such as phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. The review made it explicit that literature reviewed conforms to standards and quality indicators for experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Outcomes: The 12 studies identified and included in this review collectively provided evidence-based strategies for developing components of effective reading at elementary grades and sustaining effective reading at secondary levels. Four tables included describe details of participants, setting, strategies, and evidence of effectiveness. Implications for future research: Recommendations offered included carrying out more studies using qualitative and/or mixed-method approaches to further study use of these strategies in different classrooms and at different grade levels. An exclusive and systematic review of studies that used technology and assistive technology to teach reading could also be carried out.

AB  - Hearing aid devices are worn within people's ears to help them hear the sounds around them. Teachers have to accept the use of hearing aids in the classroom as a device to assist students with hearing loss (Plumley, 2008). Further study is helpful to hearing aid research because it demonstrates the importance of hearing aid benefit awareness in motivating parents and children to properly use hearing aids. The price of hearing aids should be reasonable enough for students to afford or the government should provide them for free. The purpose of this study was to explore male and female students' attitudes toward the use of hearing aids in Al-Ahsa Schools in Saudi Arabia using different predictors that can determine students' attitudes. The researcher identified some factors that may impact these attitudes, namely gender, perceived effectiveness, social life, denial, and adaptation, in order to reliably predict the dependent variable, attitudes of students toward the use of hearing aids. The study also intended to examine which of these predictors is the most important in examining students' attitudes. The design of multiple regression method was used in this study. The survey tool was designed by the researcher to collect and interpret the data for this study. Based on the nature of the study, the quantitative method was employed to obtain information about students' attitudes toward the use of hearing aids. One hundred and thirty-three out of 138 students participated from both special schools, only for students with hearing impairments, and public schools, which had some students with hearing impairments, in Saudi Arabia. One hundred and thirty total responses were used in the analysis after removing three cases of outliers, and the response rate of the study was 92%. The components of the survey focused on six aspects: perceived effectiveness, social life, adaptation, denial, attitudes and certain demographic questions. The results showed that an R[superscript 2] of 0.18 was obtained from the analysis indicating that approximately 18.4% of the variance of the students' attitudes toward the use of hearing aids can be accounted for, based on the sample size, by the linear combination of perceived effectiveness, social life, adaptation, denial, and gender. The adjusted (R[superscript 2]) indicates that the combination of predictors resulted in determining around 15% of the variance in the dependent variable, students' attitudes when considering the whole population. The analysis showed only one of five predictors, the perceived adaptation, significantly predicted the dependent variable (N= 130, beta= 0.3, p less than 0.05). The other predictors were not significantly successful in determining the dependent variable. The results showed there was no significant difference between boys' and girls' attitudes toward the use of hearing aids. Based on the ANOVA table, the combination of the five independent variables significantly predicted the dependent variable.

AB  - Special education services provided students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Saudi Arabia have been growing rapidly over the last two decades and teachers must be well-versed to address their students' needs. However, studies examining aspects of these services are scarce. The current study aimed to assess knowledge about ASD, self-efficacy, the use of teaching and intervention practices, and the focus of teaching among teachers working with students with ASD in schools affiliated with the Ministry of Education. Data were collected using an online-survey with a small sample size (N =135). Results indicated that teachers demonstrated a moderate level of knowledge about ASD, and many teachers possessed faulty information related to the etiology, symptoms, or therapeutic approaches. Levels of self-efficacy varied among teachers and increased with professional development and being in an inclusive classroom. Teachers reported the use of a mixture of practices and the majority reported the use of at least one of the supported practices. While years of experience and being in an inclusive classroom increased the odds of reporting the use of at least one of the supported practices, self-efficacy lowered the odds of using such practices. Teachers reported focusing on multiple areas and the majority focused on language and communication, social skills, and academics on a daily basis. The degree of focus on different areas of teaching (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or never) was associated with some students' characteristics (i.e., communication level, and having at least one student who exhibited self-injurious, aggressive, or stereotypic and repetitive behaviors). Although limited by the method and the small sample, findings from the current study are timely and worthwhile as they help to direct the next questions in research.

AB  - This paper examines collaboration between general and special education teachers in mainstream schools in Jordan from their own points of view. It explores the extent to which teachers work collaboratively throughout the different stages of the special educational programs of students with special needs (i.e. referral, assessment, planning, and implementing the educational program stages). It also looks at constrains that may hinder this collaboration. The study adopts a mixed method design, where teachers' views on collaboration and constrains on collaboration were first surveyed and then further examined through a series of semi-structured interviews. Both survey and interview results showed that teachers collaborate at a low level throughout the different stages of the student's special educational program. Results also showed that collaboration is constrained by different factors including: teachers' large workload; high numbers of students in the classroom; lack of awareness of the importance of collaboration; lack of pre- and in-service training in the area of inclusive education; general education teachers' negative attitudes toward working with students with special needs; and lack of support from schools administration and students' families. The results are discussed in relation to the study context: inclusive education was only recently introduced to the education system in Jordan and has therefore not yet been fully adopted or understood by the different educational parties. Also, general and special teachers education programs at both pre-service and in-service level have not updated their programs so to prepare teachers to work in inclusive educational settings and be able to collaborate with each other.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between occupational burnout among special education teachers who provide services to students with intellectual disabilities in Saudi Arabia and the experience of teachers, teaching degree levels they have achieved, grade levels they are teaching, gender, mentoring, collaboration between specialists, and class size. There were 255 participants in this study. The data were analyzed using a multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that gender was the only statistically significant independent variable relative to the burnout dimensions. The study found that female teachers had a higher level of emotional exhaustion compared to their male counterparts, and male teachers had a higher level of depersonalization than their female counterparts. Further studies to examine other independent variables such as social status, social supports, use of technology, and teachers' income to learn if any are predictors of teacher burnout are recommended to determine strategies that may reduce the burnout of special education teachers.

AB  - This qualitative study identified the common reading problems that negatively impact reading comprehension of third graders with learning disabilities. It also investigated the effective reading strategies that special education teachers have utilized to improve reading comprehension levels of the students in resource room settings. For the purpose of this study, 'effective reading comprehension strategies' are defined as any strategies that have been found by the special education teachers as beneficial for improving reading comprehension levels of third graders with learning disabilities in the resource room setting. Importantly, a particular reading comprehension strategy could be beneficial based on these teachers' experiences while working with students who have learning disabilities, but it might not have been found to be an effective reading strategy in the literature. Thus, the focus of this research was on determining the effectiveness of using a particular strategy based on teachers' teaching experiences, rather than strategies only found in the literature. This study was conducted in five public elementary schools, in mid-size, mid-western cities. The schools met the following criteria: (a) located in the Southwest region of Michigan, (b) within 30 miles of the sponsoring university, (c) 5% or more of the student body certified as having learning disabilities, and (d) have a resource room. The participants were five special education teachers who have (a) a minimum of three-years' experience in teaching and working with elementary students with learning disabilities, (b) a learning disabilities endorsement, and (c) a minimum of 3-year experience of delivering reading instruction to third graders in the resource room setting. The data collection procedure involved semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The special education teachers in this research pointed out that the reading problems that negatively influence reading comprehension of their third graders with learning disabilities include: (a) issues with background knowledge, (b) trouble with fluency, (c) difficulty with informational text, (d) difficulty with making inferences, (e) issues with vocabulary, and (f) low reading level. According to the special education teachers, there are numerous reading comprehension strategies found to be effective to improve comprehension of third graders with learning disabilities. These include graphic organizers, questioning, story mapping, peer-assisted strategy, think aloud, discussing the text with students, and different grouping. The special education teachers informally assess their students' reading comprehension through retelling, questioning, Cloze procedure, having students fill in graphic organizers, and writing activity. Recommendations for further research include: (a) conducting a study that specifically explores the most beneficial methods to enhance the relationship between special education and general education teachers in order to create a kind of consistency in their strategies while working with students with learning disabilities in both settings, the resource room and the general class room, (b) conducting a quantitative study that investigates the effective reading strategies that special education teachers utilize to improve the students' reading comprehension. Based on the responses of special education teachers' in this current study, a unique survey could be developed as an instrument for collecting the data from participants. The participants could be special education teachers from multiple states or multiple regions within the same state, and (c) replicating the present study and including a larger sample size that will be collected from more than one region. The results of that replication could support the finding of this study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Inclusion in public schools involves providing the least restrictive environment for students with disabilities. A lack of understanding often exists among general and special education teachers in relation to the implementation of inclusion in general education classrooms. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the daily lived experiences of 4 general and 4 special education elementary school teachers who taught in an inclusion setting in a large urban district in the southeastern United States. The conceptual framework for this study was based on Glasser's concept of an individual's quality world. Data were collected from initial and follow up interviews as well as reflective journals. A modified van Kaam method recommended by Moustakas was used to analyze the data, involving listing and preliminary grouping, reduction and elimination, clustering and thematizing, and final identification of the invariant constituents and themes. Key findings are that a participant believed successful implementation of inclusion is dependent on professional development opportunities, administrator support, and mutual respect between general and special education teachers. Recommendations are to consider professional development related to effective inclusion practices, development of support groups, and careful pairing of teachers who work together in the inclusion setting. Implications for positive social change are that general education teachers may be more receptive to integrating student with disabilities in the general education setting, and special education teachers may take a more active role in the implementation of inclusion.

AB  - Examining efforts to provide both remedial and special education programs through Chapter 1 of the Educational Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1980 (ECIA), a study considered two broad areas which influence the quality of remedial instruction offered in schools: (1) aspects of district-level organizational policies and how they influence opportunities for literacy instruction; and (2) the nature of the literacy instruction that Chapter 1 and mainstreamed mildly handicapped students experience across the school day. The whole school day experiences of 52 second and fourth grade children (26 at each grade level) from four school districts were analyzed. The school districts varied in size and community type, and students were drawn from an array of regular education classes and were provided instructional support services by 20 different specialist teachers (10 Chapter 1 and 10 special education teachers). In order to clarify district and school policies and instructional experiences, interviews were conducted with district and school building administrators, as well as specialist and classroom teachers. Student observational records focused on field notes, curricula materials in use and photocopies of completed student work, and instructional experiences were studied using the Student Observation Instrument (SOI). Findings were analyzed according to district and grade level, and showed that in general, the observed instructional experiences did not fulfill the expectation that remedial and mildly handicapped students had access to larger amounts of superior instruction. Many students experienced undifferentiated instruction in both classroom and resource room and a fragmentation of curricular experiences. (Forty-five references are appended.) (MM)

AB  - Active supervision is a proactive, low-intensity strategy to minimize challenging behaviors and increase desired behaviors. To examine the evidence base of this strategy, we applied the Council for Exceptional Children's (CEC) Standards for Evidence-Based Practices in Special Education to the body of research exploring the impact of active supervision with Pre-K–12 students in traditional school settings. In this systematic literature review, we identified seven peer-reviewed, single-case design, treatment-outcome studies meeting inclusion criteria. All studies met a ≥80% weighted criterion of CEC's quality indicators. These seven studies included 15 cases aggregated at the school, classroom, or grade level, collectively involving 1,686 participants. Three studies included three or more cases and demonstrated positive effects across primary dependent variables (with one study showing neutral effects on a secondary dependent variable). Based on available evidence and using CEC criteria, we determined active supervision to be a potentially evidence-based practice. We discuss implications, limitations, and future directions.

AB  - Teachers from government and independent schools anonymously completed a measure of attitudes towards applied behavior analysis (ABA) before and after participation in a short seminar on ABA. A total of 187 primary teachers provided data on professional qualifications, years of teaching, school type, number of students in the classroom, and prior knowledge of ABA. Data were also collected on the number of students with a disability the teacher had instructed. Survey results suggested that, before and after the seminar, teachers held negative attitudes towards ABA. These attitudes, however, significantly and positively shifted after attending the seminar. Neither the number of students taught with a disability over the last 5 years nor teacher type (e.g., specialist or classroom) nor school type (e.g., independent or government) was significantly related to the attitude measure. The findings have implications for ongoing teacher education and professional development, as well as for school psychologists tailoring interventions and framing recommendations for teachers in mainstream primary settings.

AB  - Self-determination, the combination of skills, knowledge, and beliefs that enable a person to engage in goal-directed, self-regulated, autonomous behavior, has become an important part of special education and related services for people with disabilities. The authors conducted a review of literature and used quantitative methods of meta-analysis to investigate what self-determination interventions have been studied, what groups of individuals with disabilities have been taught self-determination, and what levels of outcomes have been achieved using self-determination interventions. 51 studies were identified that intervened to promote 1 or more components of self-determination; 22 were included in meta-analyses. The median effect size across 100 group intervention comparisons was 1.38. In contrast, 13 single subject studies included 18 interventions and produced a median percentage of nonoverlapping data (PND) of 95% with a range of 64% to 100%. Seven of the interventions had a PND of 100%, suggesting strong effects. Although all components of self-determination were reflected in this research, most focused on teaching choice making to individuals with moderate and severe mental retardation or self-advocacy to individuals with learning disabilities or mild mental retardation.

AB  - Evaluated the caseloads for teachers of students classified as seriously emotionally disturbed/behaviorally disordered to compare current service delivery across states and to evaluate hypothetical predictions of student achievement based on different teacher-student ratios. Caseloads in special education classes for students with behavioral disorders were illustrated and compared to student-teacher ratios reported in the World Almanac (1989). Broad program comparisons as well as state-by state variations within programs were completed and hypothetical estimates of achievement were derived using modifications of sextant regression equations. The average special education caseload was lower than the student-teacher ratio reported for regular education; the average number of seriously emotionally disturbed/behaviorally disordered students per teacher ranged from 3.1 to 35.0. Based on these figures, hypothetical relations between caseload and predicted student achievement were evaluated. As caseload increased, predicted achievement decreased (in z-score units) and practical differences were evident between states with large differences in caseloads. Implications of the present and suggested future studies are offered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The findings from this qualified phenomenological research study involved 20 secondary general education teachers who taught inclusion classes. The research study investigated the lived experiences and perceptions of teachers through in-depth interviews and using a modified van Kaam method of data analysis, Atlas.ti 6 software, and Microsoft Excel to corroborate involvement between teacher efficacy and dissonance. Ten themes emerged from the research study: (a) class size, (b) students' learning modalities, (c) dissonance from high-stakes testing, (d) inadequate professional development, (e) inclusion classes required an inordinate amount of preparation, (f) teachers should receive higher compensation for instructing inclusion classes, (g) empathy for special-needs students, (h) dissonance had an adverse effect on efficacy, (i) pressure from high-stakes testing increased teacher dissonance, and (j) co-teachers should have subject matter content certification. All the emerged themes influenced the quality of teacher efficacy. Recommendations include provision for enhanced meaningful professional development for teaching in the inclusion setting that will produce optimal results for students.

AB  - Middle school teachers are responsible for managing their students' externalizing behaviors on a daily basis, but educator training rarely addresses classroom management (Stough, 2006). With an increase in mainstreaming, students with diverse mental health needs are frequently attending general education classes (Malti & Noam, 2008). Unfortunately, many teachers lack the necessary resources and feel unprepared to work with these students. The purpose of this study was to describe general education middle school teachers' personal viewpoints on and responses to externalizing behaviors in public school classrooms. Using a transcendental phenomenological framework, the researcher investigated 10 teachers' experiences with externalizing behaviors. From the qualitative semi-structured interviews, nine categories and 38 themes emerged. The categories were: (a) types of externalizing behaviors, (b) methods of response, (c) purposes of behavior management, (d) teachers' character traits, (e) availability of support staff, (f) causes of student behavior, (g) development of a response style, (h) thoughts and feelings about teaching, and (i) systemic areas of concern. The participants' viewpoints on, and responses to, externalizing behaviors were generally consistent with the literature. Acting out, bullying, off task behaviors, and talking out of turn were the most commonly identified externalizing behaviors. Most of the participants described either systematic methods of behavior management or broad categories of ideal character traits that encompassed desired behaviors. They generally preferred to address behaviors one on one and without the help of administration. Exuding a calm, supportive, respectful, and caring nature helped them to build connections with their students. The teachers implemented methods they learned at in-service trainings, advice from colleagues, and parenting techniques to develop their response styles over time. They learned through experience that student misconduct is not personal. A lack of administrative support, funding, and personnel, in addition to large class sizes and sparse counseling services were identified as areas of concern. They believed that special needs and community, family, and emotional problems could cause student misconduct. Parental involvement and a healthy community environment were identified as protective factors. Further research is needed to identify factors that decrease externalizing behaviors in schools.

AB  - Teachers' attitudes toward the integration of students with special needs into their classrooms were studied using interview data from 40 teachers in a variety of educational disciplines in the city of Melilla. Professors in Special Education, Hearing & Language, Therapeutic Pedagogy, & Music Education had the most positive attitudes, while those in Early Childhood Education & Foreign Languages had the most negative. Professors agreed in theory on the need to mainstream special education students, but reported many difficulties with it in everyday practice. They have fears that they lack the training to handle the students, that other students will ridicule them, or that the classroom sizes will be too large to give the special education students sufficient attention. 3 Tables, 31 References.

AB  - Presented are guidelines and evaluative data on five instructional models implemented between 1972 and 1975 to educate emotionally disturbed students in Alachua County Schools (Florida). General information includes the philosphy of the program; a definition and list of characteristics of emotionally disturbed students; and an outline of screening, referral, identification, placement, and dismissal procedures. Described next are the rationales, educational techniques, advantages and disadvantages of the five instructional program models used: self-contained classroom, resource room, crisis intervention room, itinerant program, and diagnostic-prescriptologist. Five program objectives are explained and an evaluation of progress made in meeting them during 1972-74 is provided. Comparative data in the relative effectiveness of the five organizational models for instruction includes characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of each model and a brief discussion of behavioral and achievement test data. Also reported are program objectives and evaluative data on the two models, resource and self-contained, considered most effective and continued during the 1974-75 school year. Parent education services are summarized. Appendixes include forms used for screening, referral, identification, placement, and dismissal; and technical analyses of data. (LS)

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative multiple case study was to examine the experiences of mobile Active Duty Military Spouses (ADMS) of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) to document the types of school support they are getting and what further school services the children may need to succeed socially and academically. Using a multiple case study with triangulation, data were collected from a pre-interview survey that listed the exclusion criteria, a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, and reflective timeline/essay. Data were analyzed using NVivoRTM 12. Cases were created in NVivoRTM 12 to develop units of observation, grouping, and comparison. The exploration led to discovering the three dominant themes including (a) academic success, (b) social success and (c) EFMP success. Through the nature of the in-depth case study investigation, various alleged and expected themes were revealed by the participants. The results of this study implied that ASD military dependents are one of the most underserved population and do not receive the appropriate services for their academic and social needs from schools or military programs. In the cases where the services and support are available, there are usually delays waiting for approval and accessing needed care or the quality of the intervention may be questionable. This study further showed there are not enough providers to meet the needs of military dependents diagnosed with ASD or provide continuity of care. Therefore, there is a growing need for the policymakers and the military services to give special consideration to this underserved military population. Recommendations for future research include enlarging the sample size, using civilian families who are highly mobile and following ADMFs for more extended periods of time. With this information, researchers could possibly create a blueprint of successful strategies for ASD families. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - In this paper, the opinions of elementary school teachers who have students with reading/understanding difficulties in their class on reading/understanding difficulties and providing education with special education teachers in the same classroom are examined. Teacher opinions are examined under three headings: “the problems/difficulties experienced by students with reading/understanding difficulties”, “the type and frequency of support needed by teachers in solving reading/understanding difficulties” and “opinions on serving in the same classroom with special education teacher”. In the literature, case study pattern which is a qualitative research pattern was employed. The study was based on purposive sampling and “convenience sampling” was used. All class teachers who participated in the study were employed at elementary schools in Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia, Güzelyurt and İskele regions of Northern Cyprus. The measuring tool used in the study was “semi-structured interview form” prepared by researchers based on expert opinions. Obtained data were analysed using “content analysis” technique. According to the results of the study, classroom teachers state that students with reading/comprehension difficulties are having problems in understanding and interpreting the questions and directives as regards the text, making reading errors (adding, omitting, changing letters, pauses) and their language skills in Turkish and grammar problems affect all other courses negatively. It is also claimed that students are not interested in courses. It is found out that a majority of classroom teachers do not use any special strategy while working with students having these difficulties, but frequently felt the need to benefit from the experiences of special education teachers. In addition, different opinions were declared on “co-teaching” performed by special education teacher and classroom teachers in the same classroom. Based on the research findings, it is believed that although there are some positive opinions, classroom teachers are not ready to provide education in cooperation with special education teachers in the same classroom environment.

AB  - Discussed are recommendations of California's 1987 School Readiness Task Force for the education of children 4 through 6 years of age. Recommendations call for: (1) provision of an appropriate, integrated, experiential curriculum; (2) reduction of class size; (3) provision of programs that meet the special needs of culturally and linguistically diverse students and of exceptional children; (4) implementation of classroom organization and teaching methods that reflect the heterogeneous skills and abilities of early primary children; (5) provision of appropriate education, training, and remuneration to staff; (6) inclusion of an option for full-day programs; (7) provision of before- and after-school child care or links with child development programs; (8) drastic alteration of child assessment methods; (9) provision of funding and support; (10) the building or remodeling of facilities for the purpose of meeting the needs of early primary programs; (11) encouragement of parental involvement; and (12) implementation of a public awareness campaign that describes appropriate educational practices for children. Estimates of the fiscal impact of the recommendations are included at the end of the report. (RH)

AB  - This study investigated the cross‐national adaptation and implementation of Papilio, a German social–emotional learning programme, in Finnish early childhood education and care (ECEC) centres. Papilio is a developmentally focused, scientifically based intervention programme focused on preventing behavioural problems and fostering social–emotional competence in children aged 3–7. The aim of this study was to investigate and evaluate the cross‐national adaptation and cross‐cultural adaptation and implementation of Papilio in the Finnish ECEC context. Results from qualitative interviews with one Finnish Papilio trainer, 11 early childhood education (ECE) teachers, two ECE special education teachers and two nursery nurses are supplemented with teachers' and nursery nurses' (N = 75) questionnaire data. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed that cultural adaptations were necessary on four levels: accommodation of materials, adaptation of the contents of the materials, structure and delivery. The materials and training contents were culturally adapted, whereas the delivery of the intervention was adapted according to Finnish ECEC practices. The structural adaptation included discarding timeout, due to opposition by some educators. The educators were committed to implementing the programme as instructed and resolving the practical difficulties they encountered. Their motivation to implement Papilio increased as they observed improvements in the children's social–emotional competence during intervention.

AB  - Anxiety in autism is commonly reported by parents, but teacher reports of anxiety in their students with autism have received little attention. This paper presents the results from the first systematic review on anxiety in children with autism at school. Six intervention studies (five of which were based upon cognitive–behavioural therapy) and 26 descriptive/non-experimental studies met inclusion criteria. Sample populations from included studies were frequently drawn from psychiatric clinics, with females and children attending special schools underrepresented, making generalisability of results difficult. Few studies used anxiety-specific measures, with most reporting anxiety-related subscale means from broader emotional/behavioural questionnaires. While 19 studies included multiple informants, which is recommended practice, only seven studies combined parent, teacher and child reports of anxiety. Comparison between informants proved difficult, with varying sample sizes and few studies using the same measure across participant groups. To further our understanding of the presentation of anxiety in children with autism attending school, studies need to include multiple informants and, where possible, extend beyond reporting average scores from broad anxiety subscales to provide descriptions of presentation and symptomatology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to collect and analyze information about teachers who refer male students, especially African American male students, to special education. The referral rates of Title I and Non-Title I teachers, who vary with respect to Personal Teaching Efficacy (PTE) and a Sense of Teaching Efficacy (STE), were compared. The findings of this study were analyzed from John Anderson's (1990) Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational Theory. This study explored African American male students' behavioral and verbal communication styles, which may make them more susceptible to referral. Also, the role of High/Low PTE and STE are examined to determine their role, if any, in the referral of African American males to special education. It was hypothesized that teachers from Title I schools would have a higher referral rate than teachers from Non-Title I schools and teachers with Low PTE/STE would have a higher referral rate than teachers with High PTE/STE. A total of 77 referring teachers (Title I = 42 and Non-Title I = 35) were administered a Data Information Sheet and Teacher Efficacy Scale (Gibson & Dembo, 1984; Woolfolk & Hoy, 1990). Based on scores, selected teachers were given the Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale (Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001), classroom observations, and interviewed. Analysis of Variance revealed a non-significant difference between the referral rate of teachers at Title I and Non-Title I schools and a significant difference between Ethnicity of Student Referral for Type of School, Type of PTE, and Type of STE. Tukey analyses revealed that African American males were referred significantly more than other males to special education. Significant interactions for Average Referrals by both Type of PTE and Ethnicity and Type of STE and Ethnicity revealed that High PTE/STE teachers referred more males/African American males to special education than Low PTE/STE teachers. Additional analyses revealed significant main effects for Total/Average Referrals by both Age of Teacher and Ethnicity of Student Referral. The findings of this study provide evidence that African American males continue to be referred to special education, at a greater rate, than other males. The influence of High/Low PTE and STE on male student referrals is paramount in developing a plan to decrease the number of African American males disproportionately referred and placed in special education. The role of Age of Teacher influencing male student referral is a new variable that should be considered for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The term "class size" refers to the number of students who regularly appear in a teacher's classroom and for whom that teacher is primarily responsible and accountable. "Pupil-teacher ratio" (PTR), in contrast, is an estimate commonly computed by dividing the number of students at a site by the number of professionals who serve or work there. These professionals might include special teachers, counselors, media personnel, or other categories of school workers. Research has established that small class size influences educational outcomes favorably, and that PTR has little influence on outcomes. Further research is needed to explain why this should be so. However, when questions about PTR are removed from the analysis, it is evident that teachers in small classes are responsible and accountable for the learning outcomes of students in their classes.

AB  - As poverty, dysfunctional families, and special needs continue to affect students, educators seek improved ways to start children in formal education. One such approach is to lower the teacher-to-pupil ratios, and recent research shows that this method positively influences pupil achievement. How the process works is not well understood. To fill this gap in knowledge, an examination of how teachers teach in these classrooms is provided in this report. The study describes life in a primary-grade classroom (with a low teacher-pupil ratio) in a fully Chapter 1-eligible school. Procedures for the research included interviews, structured classroom observations, informal classroom visitations, and the comparison of project school processes with research, other small-class settings, and"regular" or non-small settings. The focus was on first grade results, with comparisons offered for kindergarten and second grade. Findings show that comparisons of the pre- and post-observations of teachers indicated few observed changes in their behaviors following inservice activities. However, teachers in small classes demonstrated high levels of individualized instruction and minimal discipline problems. Factors such as space and materials facilitated instruction, and pretests and posttests indicated that students' performance in the small classes (n=14) were significantly better than those in the larger (n=23) classes.

AB  - This review of research connected to Project Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) is a summary of the project's ongoing work in the form of a letter from researchers to a hypothetical colleague. Project STAR has investigated the effect on student achievement and development of small classes in the primary grades (K through 3). A research consortium of four universities and the State Education Agency was formed to conduct and monitor the study with the aid of an advisory panel and outside consultants. Forty-two districts and 79 schools (later 76) participated. Three major subsidiary studies have built on STAR: (1) the Lasting Benefits study that tracks students; (2) Project Challenge, a policy application of small classes in 16 low-performing school systems; and (3) the Grade 4 (and eventually Grade 8) participation study. The database established for STAR, which now includes about 9,000 students randomly assigned to small-class, regular-class, and regular-class with aide conditions, is serving as the basis for other research, including examinations of achievement, racial differences, the interaction of school size and class size, and other state initiatives. Three appendixes present tables of research design, analysis of variance for cognitive outcomes, and rankings of Challenge districts. (Contains 8 tables and 33 references.) (SLD)

AB  - This brief third volume of a three-volume study addresses in more detail several analytical issues raised in the first two volumes. The overall study involved research on the former New Castle County (Delaware) School District--reorganized into four districts in 1981--to discover whether the 1979-82 overrepresentation of minority students (mostly blacks) in suspensions, special education, and lower academic groupings resulted from discriminatory practices. Using data from the first two volumes, this part of the study compares the effects on suspensions of variables besides race, including student socioeconomic status, sex, and class rank as well as school enrollment size and percentage of minority students. Analysis using ratios and percentages indicates that not only minority students, but also males, high school students receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and senior high school students in lower class ranks, are all overrepresented in suspensions. Further analysis using Pearson's correlation coefficient reveals no statistically significant relationships between minority suspensions and either school size or percentage of minority students. The author recommends that the schools and the community work on the entire area of discipline rather than on discipline in relation to any one factor. (RW)

AB  - In the former New Castle County (Delaware) School District (reorganized into four districts in 1981), minority students were numerically overrepresented from 1979 to 1982 in suspensions from school and in placement in special education and lower academic groupings. To determine if the overrepresentation was based on discriminatory practices or not, researchers reviewed district policies and procedures and collected data through interviews, reviews of records, onsite observations, and a survey of students, teachers, administrators, parents, and selected citizens, using the Discipline Context Inventory (DCI). Variables analyzed besides race included student socioeconomic status, sex, and class rank as well as school size and percentage of minority students. Data were analyzed using ratios, percents, correlations, nonparametric statistics, and content analysis. The results of the analysis of suspensions and discipline practices, reported here in volume 1 of the study, indicate that other factors besides race could be causing minority overrepresentation in suspensions, and that no overt institutional bias in discipline is evident. The researchers, however, note problem areas in school-community relations, curriculum and instruction, and discipline. Six appendices to this volume of the report provide methodological information, further data, and a copy of the DCI. (Author/RW)

AB  - Background: Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is characterized by difficulties with fluency, automaticity, and co-morbidity with learning. The study sought to assess the knowledge of basic school teachers on identification and support services for children with dyslexia. Method:A descriptive study design using a quantitative approach was employed for this study. The study population comprised of public basic school teachers who were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Data was collected by means of self-administered questionnaires and analysed with the aid of SPSS. Results:An average of 62% of the teachers had knowledge on dyslexia, 60.5% of teachers had knowledge on dyslexia identification and an average of 65% had knowledge on support services for children with dyslexia. There was a significant relationship between knowledge score and special education training as teachers with Bachelor's Degree in Special Education were 1.75 times more likely to have higher knowledge score on dyslexia [(AOR) = 1.75 (95% CI; 0.74 to 4.14)]. The main barriers to teaching children with dyslexia included inadequate resources, lack of training on dyslexia, large class sizes making it difficult to recognize a dyslexic as well as time to develop dyslexia friendly instructions. Conclusion: Knowledge of dyslexia among public basic school teachers within the Asokwa Sub-Metropolis was found to be average. Therefore, more in-service training on dyslexia should be organized by the Ghana Education Service for all basic school teachers.

AB  - The author examined the effectiveness of a developmental 1st-grade transition program by following the progress from kindergarten through 3rd grade of 34 children placed in a transition room program and 37 transition-room eligible (but not placed) children. The children were followed through the end of 3rd grade. The instructional context of the transition room was documented, and outcome measures included academic achievement (assessed through standardized achievement tests and teacher ratings), special education, and grade retention placements, social skills, behavior problems, and parent involvement. By the end of the study, children in the transition room program showed some academic and socioemotional advantages over their recommended-but-not-enrolled peers. However, effect sizes declined in magnitude as the study progressed. Thus, it is not clear that the findings support the transition room policy, particularly in light of serious cautions in the literature about the assumptions that lead to extra-year school policies for young children.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine classroom placement, inclusive versus non-inclusive, relative to the academic performance of students with specific learning disabilities in secondary content area classrooms. Fifty-seven high school students with learning disabilities were assessed using the Grade Level Short Form of the Multilevel Academic Survey Test (MAST). Their reading and math scores were examined relative to each student's grade level, number of general and special education classes attended, and types of placement (i.e., inclusive or non-inclusive setting). The results revealed no statistically significant evidence to indicate that students' academic achievement varied based on inclusive versus non-inclusive placement. The only statistically significant differences observed regarded participants enrolled in a general education literature class compared to those participants placed in a special education setting for literature. Implications for practice, limitations of the study, and considerations for future research are discussed.

AB  - Implementation of federally mandated classroom inclusion of students with disabilities (SWDs) in the United States is inconsistent. Research has been limited on how teachers implement inclusion in classrooms, which has prevented systemwide improvements of inclusion practices. The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to describe the circumstances and experiences of regular and special education teachers in 3rd to 6th grade inclusion classes. The theory of organizational learning served as the conceptual framework for the study. Data were collected in interviews with 7 regular education teachers (RETs) and 5 special education teachers (SETs) from 3 public school districts in a south-central U.S. state. Data were analyzed using open coding to identify themes and patterns. Results indicated that SETs served SWDs from multiple classes and sometimes from multiple grades rather than following 1 student throughout the day. Further, RETs had students with and without disabilities from up to 7 different grade levels in their inclusion classrooms. Findings also revealed that none of the participants engaged in collaborative content planning. Almost all participants expressed the need for additional teachers to reduce the teacher-to-student ratio and for more training for RETs to support inclusion of SWDs in their classes. Findings may provide information to leaders at the building, district, regional, state, and legislative levels regarding how inclusion can be improved in classrooms, including how systemic change in public school systems may be implemented.

AB  - This article covers current trends in disability rights and raises questions about how society’s views of disability influence the music education of students in need of special education services. Brief overviews of the disability-rights movement in the United States and of federal laws pertaining to disabilities and education are included. Next, there is a discussion of the “social model of disability,” which defines disability as a social position rather than a medical condition. Finally, “people-first language” and how it applies to music teaching are examined. The article also offers some suggestions to help educators incorporate these ideas into their teaching.

AB  - The increase in the number of slow learners and children with learning disabilities in schools in Africa has become a major issue and concern. The situation is reflected in various school-leaving examinations, where an average of 30 percent of the results are below average or failures each year. Although there are no statistical records available in most African countries on the number of children and youth with learning disabilities, it is believed that about 8 percent of the students in school are experiencing learning difficulties in the classroom. Diverse factors contribute to the large number of school difficulties, including overcrowded classrooms, poverty, health issues, shortages of experienced teachers, traditional beliefs, lack of teaching materials, school expectations, and motivational issues. I examine the state of education for students with learning difficulties in Africa, focusing especially on Botswana but also including information from other countries, and consider the concept, prevalence, causes, provision of services, and difficulties in providing effective services for children with learning disabilities.

AB  - Understanding the attitudes of administrators is important to the educational system because administrators are the leaders who shape and change school environment and promote the inclusion of students with disabilities into the regular education classroom. This study examined the attitudes of administrators in the state of South Carolina. The problem this study addressed was that administrators' attitudes may have an effect on integrating students with disabilities into the regular education classroom. This quantitative study analyzed elementary school administrators' attitudes and experiences concerning the inclusion of students with special needs and students with disabilities in the regular education classroom setting. The targeted population was public elementary school administrators. An a priori power analysis (GPower 3.1.92) was used to determine a minimum sample needed for an effect size (two tailed) of .30, alpha of .05, and power of .80. This resulted in an n of 84. The actual sample size obtained was 86 which met the expected size of 84. Data was collected via social media using a modified version of the Principal and Inclusion Survey tool. Descriptive statistics, product moment correlation, and independent sample t-tests were used to analyze the data. After analyzing the data for research question one, it was determined that the administrators, as a group, had a positive attitude toward students with disabilities for inclusion in the regular education classroom setting (M = 3.99, SD = .63). Data also revealed that administrators experience with students with disabilities, on average, was positive (M =22.58, SD = 5.55). Analysis of research question two revealed that administrators who had not taught special education classes had a more positive attitude toward students with disabilities (M = 4.17 vs. M = 3.63) and higher inclusion placement (M = 37.23 vs. M = 28.45) than administrators who had taught special education classes. The differences was statistically significant (p < .001). Analysis of research question three indicated that administrators preferred some form of accommodations for students with disabilities for state assessments. Recommendation for future research is to use the same instrument but change the study design to a mixed method study to allow for open-ended questions.

AB  - Background: The study focused on children with hearing disabilities, which was significant as almost 9 million children in sub-Saharan Africa, including Namibia, had hearing disabilities. The problem was the lack of prior research on the effects of assistive technology (AT) in primary education for the Deaf in Namibia, for guiding Namibian special primary schools and educators. Aim: The aim was to investigate the effects of Constructivism-led AT on the teaching and learning of learners who were deaf, in a mathematics class at a rural special primary school. Setting: The study involved Grade three children who were deaf. Grade 3 is where children learn to build and understand foundational and basic mathematical concepts, such as counting, which they require for subsequent mathematics learning and practice. Methods: The study was a mixed-methods study comprising a quantitative experiment and qualitative interviews. Results: The findings suggested that the Constructivism-led AT may have had a positive effect on the children’s multiplication and division achievement, but not on their addition and subtraction achievement. The teachers were positive about the Constructivism-led AT and indicated that it supported collaborating, cooperating, exploring, self-assessing, learning from errors, seeking knowledge independently, self-regulating, self-reflecting, metacognitive thinking and being self-aware. Conclusion: For school management and teachers of children who are deaf, the study offered an intervention for potentially improving teaching and their learners’ mathematics achievement. In addition, the study provided valuable evidence for policymakers about integrating technology for effective learning environments.

AB  - This position paper focuses on issues related to equal education in small, rural schools in Sweden. Specifically, the report analyzes national statistics, reports from the National Agency for Education, and other research regarding the status of education in Sweden. Data indicate that for the 1994-95 school year, two-thirds of the schools in Sweden had less than 200 students, with a large proportion of schools having less than 100 students. In addition, small rural schools often have less than 60 students. The Swedish education system serves approximately 900,000 students. In 1993, class size averaged 22 students, but classes in rural areas had a mean of 18.9 students. Because of small class sizes, education in Sweden's small rural schools has traditionally been organized in mixed-age groups. The closing of 76 small rural schools between 1985 and 1993 was partly due to the assumption that mixed-age grouping did not offer an equal education nor meet the objectives of the national curriculum. However, research indicates that the academic performance of students from rural areas was equal to that of students in more populated, urban areas. Small rural districts tended to have the highest proportion of teachers untrained to teach specialty subjects. However, small schools have solved this problem by collaborating with neighboring schools in offering special subjects. Sparsely populated rural districts tend to have not only fewer pupils but also a relatively high density of teachers and low average class size. As salaries constitute the greatest costs, the continued existence of small, rural schools is questioned from an economic standpoint. However, the integration of preschool with primary schools in 1994 as part of the new national curriculum has helped to save small rural schools. This report stresses the need for establishing a database for examining the effectiveness of small rural schools in Sweden. Contains 20 references. (LP)

AB  - As a result of the passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, school systems are required to provide a free and appropriate education for all children with disabilities. This legislation was further supported by The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA), which guarantees all students with disabilities access to the general education classroom and general education curriculum (US Department of Education, n.d.). Thus, the delivery of educational services for students with disabilities has shifted from segregated settings to the practice of inclusion of students with disabilities in the general education classroom. Although there are many barriers which hinder the successful implementation of inclusion, teacher attitude has been cited as the most important factor for successful inclusion. The purpose of this study was to examine general education teachers' and special education teachers' attitudes towards students with learning disabilities (LD) in the inclusive classroom. The role that teacher background and institutional variables, teacher preparedness, and performance drivers play in determining teachers' attitudes was the focus of this study. Descriptive statistics, multiple regression, ANOVA, t-tests, correlations, and focus groups were used to explore five general research questions and two focused exploratory questions. General and special education teachers were invited to participate in the study. Sixty-three teachers, mostly general education teachers, attending graduate level courses in a College of Education comprised the study pool. Most of the teachers were enrolled in the Alternative Master's program. The participants completed two online surveys: (1) Teaching students with LD in the general classroom and, (2) the modified Opinions Relative to Integration of Students with Disabilities (ORI) teacher attitude survey adapted from Antonak and Larrivee (1995). The six teacher background variables for this study were educational level, program enrollment, years of experience, teaching certification category, years of experience with students with LD in the classroom, and number of students with LD taught. The six institutional variables were grade level taught, school size, school location, level of support for inclusion, level of administrative support for inclusion, availability of instructional materials, resources, and support services. There were four performance drivers: skills and knowledge, motivation, environment, and incentives. Teacher preparedness was the final variable investigated. Teacher background variables and institutional variables were not predictive of teachers' attitudes towards students with LD in the classroom. The performance driver's motivation, environment, and incentives were positively correlated with each other, and predicted some element of teachers' attitudes toward teaching students with LD in the general education classroom. Findings from the focus group studies strengthened this research study by providing rich and substantive data which supports dated and current literature regarding facilitators and obstacles to successful implementation of inclusion.

AB  - One of the most intractable problems facing urban schools is the low performance of middle school-aged children. This is particularly true for the 13,360 students who attend the Baltimore City Public School System's (BCPSS) traditional middle schools, which serve only 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students. Not one of these 21 middle schools met adequate yearly progress in 2006; seven were targeted for State takeover in May. The System has responded largely by expanding the number of K-8 schools and closing some middle schools. Yet, due to the configuration of City school facilities, not all middle school students can be accommodated in K-8 schools. BCPSS must fully address the question: What does it take to make middle schools places where children in 6th-8th grades can succeed? Two anomalies in the disappointing landscape of City middle schools, KIPP Ujima Village and The Crossroads School, are obvious case studies. Opened as Baltimore City "New Schools Initiative" schools in fall 2002, both schools had highly-motivated founding principals and operating organizations. KIPP is under the auspices of the non-profit KIPP (Knowledge is Power Program) national network of schools and Crossroads is affiliated with The Living Classrooms Foundation. The schools used a phase-in model, expanding by one grade level each year. In fall 2005, both schools converted to Charter School status, partly due to the promise of increased per pupil funding. To date, performance of KIPP students exceeds that of all City middle and K-8 schools; KIPP's students are among the top performers in the State. Similarly Crossroads' students have higher levels of performance than students in the City's middle schools and most K-8 schools. One could argue that two other new and charter middle schools, The Stadium School and Connexions, also deserve further investigation. The success of KIPP and Crossroads raises two questions. First, can the models used by KIPP and Crossroads be used to educate all or a significant number of the Baltimore's remaining middle school population? If not, are there practices used by these two schools that could successfully be replicated in other City middle schools and K-8 schools? A number of practices and characteristics of KIPP and Crossroads appear to contribute to the extraordinary success of children in the middle grades: (1) Children (and their families) choose these schools; (2) They are operated by a third party; (3) They spend more money on a per pupil basis and raise additional private funding; (4) The overall size of the school and of each grade level is significantly smaller; (5) There is a longer school day, week and/or year; (6) The school principal is a highly competent leader who has the autonomy and support necessary to direct the school; (7) There are fewer special education children, with less severe disabilities. (8) There are slightly fewer male students; (9) Students are less likely to enter or leave; (10) No children suspended from other schools are transferred in; (11) Teachers have higher attendance rates; and (12) All children are transported to and from school by school bus. Many of these factors are not replicable in every middle school: some families would reject the longer school day or year, or the responsibility of choosing a school and committing to its expectations. At least two-thirds of students eligible for KIPP and Crossroads chose not to apply. Some of the practices of Crossroads and KIPP involve additional expenses; others are cost-free. There is no evidence on the effectiveness of any individual practice; all that is known is the positive effect of their implementation as a package in two very different schools. These practices, all of which seem desirable on their face, are enumerated.

AB  - The rationale for the existence of developmental kindergarten classes is based on individual differences, the general importance of early childhood education, and the advantages of early detection of emotional disturbance and learning disabilities. The Waukegan program focuses on early identification and specification of problems, development of perceptual skills, creation and evaluation of techniques to increase school readiness, promotion of co-operative work between school personnel, specialists and parents, and the development of children's visual, motor and language skills.

AB  - The present study was designed to measure differences in elementary school teachers' attitudes toward willingness to teach students with ADHD in their classrooms in Riyadh City in Saudi Arabia through a descriptive non-experimental quantitative research instrument. The study examined relationships among many variables through teachers' level of education, years of teaching experience in the education area, grade level of teaching, class size, previous teaching experience with any kind of disabilities, teachers' positions in schools, special education courses taken in college, teachers' in-service training, and teachers' gender. The last variable examined teachers' overall attitudes toward their willingness to teach students with ADHD in their classrooms. The participants in the study, a total of 300 elementary school teachers including 150 males and 150 females, completed the survey. Overall the results found that elementary school teachers have neutral attitudes toward willingness to teach students with ADHD in their classrooms. Moreover, the findings of the study revealed the significance of the relationship between teachers' willingness to teach students with ADHD in their classrooms and their level of education, grade level of teaching, class size, previous teaching experience with any kind of disabilities, positions in schools, special education courses taken in college, and in-service training. Finally, the study found there was no relationship among years of teaching experience in the education area or gender and teachers' attitudes toward willingness to teach students with ADHD in their classrooms.

AB  - This article describes a home-school partnership project that was introduced in two school communities, an urban and a rural. These communities are in Cyprus, a country where teacher-parent communication is still not very effective. In addition to their geographic location, the two participating schools were different in size, faculty makeup and profile of community served. The researcher used a participatory approach in order to help all the interested parties to develop ownership in the process and become fully involved in the planned activities. Action groups consisting of teachers, parents and students were set up in each school. These groups carried out needs assessment surveys and organized specific events to satisfy the identified needs. The most important elements of this endeavor were the participants' sensitization about the usefulness of true cooperation and the momentum that was created in both communities about partnerships in education. The project evaluation revealed important issues related to the implementation of similar educational interventions in the future. The most notable of these issues refer to the special role that the school principal has in the whole process, and the comparison between teachers, parents and students in urban and rural areas of Cyprus.

AB  - Researchers reviewed 20 articles on peer tutoring research in secondary settings and addressed demographics of tutors and tutees, content areas in which peer tutors were employed, tutor training required for implementing effective tutoring programs, and the effects of peer tutoring on tutee performance. Generally, peer tutoring in secondary settings results in improved academic performance of students with mild disabilities and could be classified as an evidence-based practice. It appears that training tutors on how to implement instruction produces a large effect on tutee outcomes. Additional research is needed, however, to explore several factors regarding peer tutoring in general education classes and with secondary students with culturally diverse backgrounds.

AB  - A review of the literature on the home backgrounds of moderately educationally subnormal children (ESN-m) indicates that the relatively few studies reported were limited in either range or sample size, or both. Certain characteristics, however, did emerge consistently: the majority of ESN-m children come from lower working class families; there are fewer firstborn ESN-m children than there are firstborn non-ESN-m children; the mean percentage of children from single parent or disrupted families is greater than for non-ESN-m children. The information that is available tends to support the notion of a syndrome of familial moderate educational subnormality. Evidence from one investigation points to certain ethnic differences which may be important in any program of intervention. (28 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This article reports results from a study investigating the efficacy of a proportional problem-solving intervention, schema-based instruction (SBI), in seventh grade. Participants included 806 students with mathematical difficulties in problem solving (MD-PS) from an initial pool of 1,999 seventh grade students in a larger study. Teachers and their students in the larger study were randomly assigned to an SBI or control condition and teachers in both conditions then provided instruction on the topics of ratio, proportion, and percent. We found that students with MD-PS in SBI classrooms scored on average higher than their counterparts in control classrooms on a posttest and delayed posttest administered 9 weeks later. Given students' difficulties with proportional problem-solving and the consequences of these difficulties, an important contribution of this research is the finding that when provided with appropriate instruction, students with MD-PS are capable of enhanced proportional problem-solving performance.

AB  - Reports the results of 2 studies employing a program designed to remediate word-decoding deficiencies. The Process-Based Reading Enhancement Program (PREP) is based on the Luria-Das model of information integration (J. P. Das et al, 1979), involving instruction twice weekly over 14–16 wks. In Study 1, 50 Ss were randomly selected from a 4th-grade Chapter 1 population. From this group, 25 Ss were randomly assigned to experimental and comparison groups. The PREP was administered using a 2:1 student–teacher ratio. The Word Attack and Word Identification subtests of the Woodcock Reading Mastery Tests-Revised (WRMT-R) were used as pre- and posttests. For both measures, significant group-by-time interactions were seen. In Study 2, a different sample of 37 and 41 Chapter 1 4th-graders was randomly assigned to the remediation and the comparison groups, respectively. As in Study 1, all Ss were pretested and posttested on alternate forms of the Word Attack and Word Identification subtests of the WRMT-R. The time x treatment interactions were significant for both measures. The results of these studies support the efficacy of the PREP to improve word-reading and decoding abilities.

AB  - This article reports on a comprehensive literature review and meta-analysis of 68 experiments on teaching mathematics to individuals with significant cognitive disabilities. Most of the studies in the review addressed numbers and computation or measurement. Within the computation studies identified, most focused on counting, calculation, or number matching. For the measurement studies, nearly all focused on money skills. Of the 54 single subject design studies, 19 were classified as having all quality indicators for research design (13 representing the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Measurement standard and 6 representing the Numbers and Operations standard). These studies offer strong evidence for using systematic instruction to teach mathematics skills and for using in vivo settings.

AB  - This article synthesizes the literature comparing at-risk children designated as responders and low responders to interventions in reading. The central question addressed in this review is whether individual differences in reading-related skills at pretest predict responders at posttest across a variety of interventions and sets of criteria for determining responding and low responding. A total of 13 studies met criteria for the meta-analysis, yielding 107 weighted effect sizes (ESs) at posttest (M = .76, SE = .03, 95% confidence interval [CI] =.71, .81) and 108 weighted ESs at pretest (M = 1.02, SE = .03, CI = 1.02, 1.13). The results showed that the magnitude of ES between responders and low responders increased from pretest to posttest on measures of reading (e.g., real word identification = 1.06 vs. 1.53, word attack = 1.10 vs. 1.28, and passage comprehension, 0.45 vs. 1.43). Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that overall posttest ESs were significantly moderated by pretest scores as well as the type of measure administered, whereas no significant moderating effects were found for number of weeks of intervention, length of sessions, number of sessions, type of intervention (one-to-one vs. small group instruction), and criteria for defining responders (cutoff, scores, discrepancy, benchmark). Overall, the synthesis suggested that regardless of type of treatment and identification criteria, response-to-intervention (RTI) conditions were not effective in mitigating learner characteristics related to pretest conditions.

AB  - Group contingencies are recognized as a potent intervention for addressing challenging student behavior in the classroom, with research reviews supporting the use of this intervention platform going back more than four decades. Over this time period, the field of education has increasingly emphasized the role of research evidence for informing practice, as reflected in the increased use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. In the current article, we continue this trend by applying recently developed between-case effect size measures and transparent visual analysis procedures to synthesize an up-to-date set of group contingency studies that used single-case designs. Results corroborated recent systematic reviews by indicating that group contingencies are generally effective—particularly for addressing challenging behavior in general education classrooms. However, our review highlights the need for more research on students with disabilities and the need to collect and report information about participants’ functional level.

AB  - Read aloud is a testing accommodation that has been studied by many researchers, and its use on K‐12 assessments continues to be debated because of its potential to change the measured construct or unfairly increase test scores. This study is a summary of quantitative research on the read aloud accommodation. Previous studies contributed information to compute average effect sizes for students with disabilities, students without disabilities, and the difference between groups for reading and mathematics using a random effects meta‐analytic approach. Results suggest that (1) effect sizes are larger for reading than for math for both student groups, (2) the read aloud accommodation increases reading test scores for both groups, but more so for students with disabilities, and (3) mathematics scores gains due to the read aloud accommodation are small for both students with and without disabilities, on average. There was some evidence to suggest larger effects in elementary school relative to middle and high school and possible mode effects, but more studies are needed within levels of the moderator variables to conduct statistical tests.

AB  - Students with special needs are increasingly being served in the general education classroom. Co-teaching is one service delivery option designed to meet those needs. The purpose of this article is to synthesize data-based articles pertaining to co-teaching between general and special education personnel. Of 89 articles reviewed, only 6 provided sufficient quantitative information for an effect size to be calculated. Effect sizes for the individual studies ranged from low to high, with an average total effect size of 0.40. Dependent measures were varied and included grades, achievement scores, and social and attitudinal outcomes. Results indicate that further research is needed to substantiate that co-teaching is an effective service delivery option for students with disabilities.

AB  - ; This article focuses on specialization of the educators in field of elementary and secondary education. At least three major forces have taken this position: the national curriculum projects, the teacher certification agencies of the various states, and a large group of scholars in the disciplines. Interestingly, though, all three of these forces are outside the professional groups of common school educators; yet their opinions and deliberations are having a potent effect on developments within schools. Specialization for an elementary school teacher has typically been defined as a strong subject of matter background in one discipline. Class size has long been a focus of teacher complaint. Yet until recently much of the teacher's teaching could be done as well with large groups as with small. The real urgency of reducing class size is related to the increasing attempts to individualize and personalize instruction. Every classroom teacher, in any kind of school organization, must be a specialist in the art of providing a flexible environment for learning.

AB  - Summarizes the postgraduation outcomes of 298 students verified as either specific learning disabled (SLD) or mentally handicapped (MH) who graduated between 1979 and 1988 from a rural special education program. The transitional experience was more successful for employment than for living outcomes for these Ss. Whereas 9.8% of the SLD Ss were unemployed when contacted in 1989, 55% were still living with parents. Although 83% of the SLD Ss were working, their work profile was characterized by low pay and limited benefits. Although SLD Ss did better than the MH Ss on most variables, no differences were found between the 2 groups in percent employed, work-related benefits, and current living environment. The primary predictors of current employment status, job type, job-pattern stability, and living arrangement were (1) tested IQ, (2) verified handicap, (3) gender, (4) family involvement, and (5) size of school.

AB  - The efficacy of a research-based fraction sense intervention for sixth graders with or at risk for mathematics difficulties (N = 52) was examined. The intervention aimed to build understanding of fraction magnitudes on the number line. Key concepts were taught with a narrow range of denominators to develop deep understanding. The intervention was centered on a visual number line in the meaningful context of a color run race. Students were randomly assigned to the fraction sense intervention (n = 25) or a business-as-usual control group (n = 27). Students in the intervention condition received 21 lessons in small groups (45 min each) during their regular mathematics intervention period. Students in the intervention group performed significantly better than those in the control group on a measure of fraction number line estimation and a more general measure of fraction concepts, both at immediate posttest and delayed posttest, with large effect sizes; lesser effects were shown for fraction arithmetic.

AB  - Current models for evaluating inclusive education programs tend to examine surface-level stricture of day-to-day practices in the organization and operation of schools and also lack significant input from disabled people. In response, the authors have developed a DRE Model to understand and evaluate effective Inclusive Education that is derived from reports of international consumer organizations such as Disabled People’s International, Inclusion International, and the World Institute on Disability. The DRE Model draws from the interdisciplinary field of disability studies and is based on the philosophy that disability must be approached in its full social dimension as one of the central elements in every culture’s response to the full range of human difference. Conceptually, the DRE Model allows people to look at developments in Inclusive Education across widely disparate local and international contexts. An inclusive education project in Lesotho is described and analysed to explain the DRE Model’s dynamic processes more concretely, and to demonstrate its potential utility for evaluation and future planning.

AB  - This article focuses on the role the Dutch school for children with “learning and behavioural problems” (LOM) has played in knowledge production about learning disabilities and in the development of academic study of special education between 1949 and 1985. LOM-schooling grew rapidly during these years and attracted relatively many experts. In the selection and admission of LOM-children they had to be distinguished from normal, mentally deficient, and “very difficult” children. Around 1970 experts shifted their focus from the distinction between LOM-children and the latter to the difference between LOM- and mildly mentally retarded children, which turned out to be too small in the end to justify a separate school. The LOM-school’s culture of knowledge production has stimulated both testing and the study of learning problems and their treatment. It functioned as a laboratory for the development of therapeutic treatment for learning disabilities. In particular, the systematic reflection on the practice of remedial teaching was relevant in the development of child science.

AB  - Two studies examined developmental outcomes associated with services in inclusive and self-contained preschool classrooms. In Study 1, the effects of classroom inclusion on the developmental and social growth of preschool children with disabilities were investigated on 15 pairs of children (N = 30) matched for chronological age, gender, initial level of functioning, related services received, and attendance schedules. Progress was measured with the Brigance Diagnostic Inventory of Early Development-Revised using a pre-post design. Results indicated that children functioning at a lower level of social and emotional functioning performed equally well in inclusive and specialized settings, while children functioning at a relatively higher level performed better in inclusive settings than in specialized settings. In Study 2, the relationships between developmental progress and the length of the school day and the amount of related services received per week were investigated on 66 participants. Children in full-day classrooms had greater developmental delays but achieved higher rates of progress than their half-day peers in the areas of social and emotional development and overall development.

AB  - Addresses 2 possible solutions to the question of educating special needs children in Denmark and the United States (US), comparing legislation, curriculum planning, and the role of the school psychologist. Providing quality education for children with special needs has been a long-term commitment for the governments of Denmark and the US. Educators, psychologists, and parent groups all have argued for 1 strategy or another (e.g., home teaching, segregated classes for children with the same handicap, special schools, regular classroom placements with resource rooms at the school site). There is a striking similarity between the underlying philosophical beliefs in PL 94-142 in the US and its Danish equivalent, Law 302. The US law stresses the concept of 'least restrictive environment' for special needs children, while the Danish Law 302 prescribes the 'principle of integration.' Both systems rely upon specially trained teachers as a resource and emphasize preparation of a program for individual needs. In both countries, the school psychologist remains a vital part of the educational team, providing input to aid in decision-making and evaluation of the best possible placement for a child. Although in Denmark there is a more favorable ratio of psychologists to students than in the US, neither system seems adequately staffed to provide the kind of psychological services required in the 1980's by the family, school personnel, and the child.

AB  - School reform movements sweeping across U.S. schools have made claims of accountability for all students' learning. The Bush administration has proposed reform strategies so that “no child is left behind” (Department of Education, p. 1). Fueled by the poor test performance of inner-city students, those proposals have given rise to an overreliance on high-stakes testing as a vehicle for accountability. Given the persistent overrepresentation of African Americans in special education classes, conversations about school reform must include African American learners' needs. School reform proposals predicated on high-stakes testing will ensure that the very child who gets left behind will be African American. This article focuses on the impact of standards-based school reform practices on African American learners, especially those in special and remedial classes. First, a rationale is presented for standards-based school reform that is culturally responsive and not premised on high-stakes, high-pressure assessments. Subsequent to that discussion, current school reform practices will be explored relative to the psychosocial development of African American learners. The focus is on high-stakes testing and African American learners' development of racial identity, self-concept, and achievement orientation. Finally, recommendations are identified for school reform that focus on accountability while promoting cultural responsiveness to African American learners.

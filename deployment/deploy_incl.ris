AB  - Large cohort studies suggest that most military personnel experience minimal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following warzone deployment, an outcome often labeled resilience. Very low symptom levels, however, may be a marker for low exposure, not resilience, which requires relatively high-magnitude or high-frequency stress exposure as a precondition. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to examine the longitudinal course of lifetime PTSD symptoms following combat exposure by disaggregating deployed U.S. Marines into upper, middle, and lower tertiles of combat exposure. All factor models fit the data well; Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) values ranged from .91 to .97. Three distinct trajectories best explained the data within each tertile. The upper tertile comprised True Resilience (73.2{%}), New-Onset Symptoms (18.3{%}), and Pre-existing Symptoms (8.5{%}) trajectories. The middle tertile also comprised True Resilience (74.5{%}), New-Onset Symptoms (16.1{%}), and Pre-existing Symptoms (9.4{%}) trajectories. The lower tertile comprised Artifactual Resilience (86.3{%}), Pre-existing Symptoms (7.6{%}), and New-Onset Symptoms (6.1{%}) trajectories. True Resilience involved a clinically significant symptom increase followed by a return to baseline, whereas Artifactual Resilience involved consistently low symptoms. Conflating artifactual and true resilience may inaccurately create the expectation of persistently low symptoms regardless of warzone exposure.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the lifetime prevalence of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among a representative, active military sample, and to identify demographic and military variables that modulate rates of trauma exposure as well as PTSD rates and duration. Method: A cross-sectional weighted sample of 5155 regular members and 3957 reservists (n = 8441) of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) was face-to-face interviewed using a lay-administered structured interview that generates Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, psychiatric diagnoses. Results: Within this sample, 85.6{%} reported 1 or more trauma exposure, with a median number of 3 or more exposures. Compared with males, females were less likely (P {<} 0.05) to be exposed to warlike trauma (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.40), disasters (AOR 0.43), assaultive violence (AOR 0.52), and witnessing trauma (AOR 0.75). However, they were more likely to report sexual assault (AOR 7.36). The lifetime prevalence of PTSD was 6.6{%} and the conditional rate was 7.7{%}. Both lifetime and conditional PTSD rates were higher among female soldiers, but lower among the reserve forces, both male and female. Finally, the median duration of PTSD was negatively influenced by younger age of onset, but not influenced by whether the event occurred during deployment. Conclusions: Active members of the CAF report a high degree of trauma exposure but a moderate rate of lifetime PTSD. Copyright {©} 2015 Pfizer Canada Inc. Kirkland, Quebec.

AB  - Our objective was to examine symptom-level changes in the course in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across the deployment cycle among combat-exposed Marines, and to determine the degree to which combat exposure and post-deployment stressor exposure predicted PTSD symptom profile transitions. We examined PTSD symptoms in a cohort of U.S. Marines (N = 892) recruited for the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS). Marines deployed as one battalion infantry unit to Afghanistan in 2010 and were assessed pre-deployment and one, five, and eight months post-deployment. We employed latent transition analysis (LTA) to examine Marines' movement across PTSD symptom profiles, determined by latent class analysis (LCA). LCAs revealed a 3-class solution one month pre-deployment, a 4-class solution at five months post-deployment, and a 3-class solution at eight months post-deployment. LTA revealed notable movement between classes over time, which depended chiefly on pre-deployment symptom presentation. Marines who reported few pre-deployment symptoms either maintained these low levels or returned to low levels by eight months. Marines who reported a moderate number of symptoms at pre-deployment had variable outcomes; 50{%} had reductions by eight months, and those who reported numbing symptoms at five months post-deployment tended to report more symptoms at eight months. Marines who reported more PTSD symptoms prior to deployment retained more symptoms eight months post-deployment. Combat exposure and post-deployment stressor exposure predicted profile transitions. Examining transitions between latent class membership over time revealed prognostic information about Marines' eight-month PTSD outcomes. The extent of pre-deployment PTSD symptoms was particularly informative of likely PTSD outcomes. Copyright {©} 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Exposure to potentially traumatic stressors during military deployment places service members at risk for poor post-deployment physical health. The relationship between stressor exposure and physical health is complex, with numerous factors potentially impacting the likelihood of subsequent health problems and decrements to health-related functioning. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with poor health in both civilians and veterans, and represents one potential pathway of risk. The present study examined associations between combat exposure and post-deployment physical health and health functioning, with a focus on PTSD symptom severity as a potential mediator. Methods: Participants included 2929 (92{%} male; mean age: 30) Army personnel who had been deployed to the Gulf War; they completed three waves of a large-scale longitudinal study. Time 1 (T1) surveys were completed within 5 days of return from Gulf War deployment, Time 2 (T2) surveys were completed 18-24 months later, and Time 3 (T3) surveys were completed 4-5 years after T2. War zone stressor exposure was assessed at T1. PTSD symptom severity was evaluated at T1 and T2 using the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD. Post-deployment onset physical health (symptoms and conditions) were evaluated using self-reported checklists at T3, and health-related functioning/quality of life was measured using the SF-36. Data were analyzed using latent change score models within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Results: Significant bivariate associations were found among war zone stressor exposure, PTSD symptom severity, and physical health. SEM results suggest both important direct links from war zone stressors and PTSD symptom shifts to health outcomes and the proposed mediational role of change in PTSD symptom severity over time. Conclusions: Findings suggest that worsening PTSD symptom severity undermines physical and functional health among Veterans deployed during the Gulf War. Also, change in PTSD symptom severity was a significant mediating mechanism linking war zone stressor exposure to indicators of physical and functional health. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring PTSD symptoms and health status over time in this and other populations of deployed veterans. (Figure presented).

AB  - An association between combat exposure and postdeployment behavioral health problems has been demonstrated among U.S. military service members returning from Afghanistan or Iraq in predominantly male samples, yet few studies have focused on the experiences of women. Using data from the longitudinal, observational Substance Use and Psychological Injury Combat (SUPIC) Study, we explored the self-report of 4 combat exposure items and postdeployment behavioral health screening results for 42,397 Army enlisted women who had returned from Afghanistan or Iraq from fiscal years 2008 through 2011. We ran multivariate logistic regression models to examine how a constructed composite combat exposure score (0, 1, 2, 3+) was associated with screening positive postdeployment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and at-risk drinking among active duty (AD) and National Guard/Reserve (NG/R) women. AD and NG/R women commonly reported being wounded, injured, assaulted, or hurt (17.3% an)

AB  - Over 2.5 million Americans served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In this short article, we consider the impact of these experiences on their future welfare. Specifically, we ask if those who served in Afghanistan and Iraq are more or less likely to exploit their GI Bill benefits in order to pursue higher education than service members who did not directly participate in these conflicts. We exploit a comprehensive administrative dataset that the US Armed Forces' Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) provided to us. We find across models that deployment to Afghanistan or Iraq significantly increases the likelihood that veterans will take advantage of their educational benefits, but that exposure to violent combat significantly decreases it.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been consistently reported as being highly comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) and as being associated with health related functional impairment (HRF). We used archival data from 283 previously war-zone deployed Canadian veterans. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to uncover patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity as measured via the PTSD Checklist-Military version (PCL-M) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Individual membership of latent classes was used in a series of one-way ANOVAs to ascertain group differences related to HRF as measured via the Short-Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). LPA resulted in three discrete patterns of PTSD and MDD comorbidity which were characterized by high symptoms of PTSD and MDD, moderate symptoms, and low symptoms. All ANOVAs comparing class membership on the SF-36 subscales were statistically significant demonstrating group differences across levels of HRF. The group with the highest sym)

Six literature databases and 2 databases containing unclassified military reports were searched for relevant papers produced between January 1996 and May 2016. The search criteria were broad to allow for the identification of all relevant studies on the topic. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria; all of which were conducted in the U.S. with the U.S. Air Force personnel. The main sources of occupational stress reported by participants across the studies were operational. The rates of mental health diagnoses, including PTSD, were low, but levels of psychological distress were higher in drone and intelligence operators than in comparison groups.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health injury characterised by re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing and hyperarousal. Whilst the aetiology of the disorder is relatively well understood, there is debate about the prevalence of cognitive sequelae that manifest in PTSD. In particular, there are conflicting reports about deficits in executive function and mental flexibility. Even less is known about the neural changes that underlie such deficits. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to study differences in functional connectivity during a mental flexibility task in combat-related PTSD (all males, mean age = 37.4, n = 18) versus a military control (all males, mean age = 33.05, n = 19) group. We observed large-scale increases in theta connectivity in the PTSD group compared to controls. The PTSD group performance was compromised in the more attentionally-demanding task and this was characterised by 'late-stage' theta hyperconnectivity, concentrated in network connections involving right parietal cortex. Furthermore, we observed significant correlations with the connectivity strength in this region with a number of cognitive-behavioural outcomes, including measures of attention, depression and anxiety. These findings suggest atypical coordination of neural synchronisation in large scale networks contributes to deficits in mental flexibility for PTSD populations in timed, attentionally-demanding tasks, and this propensity toward network hyperconnectivity may play a more general role in the cognitive sequelae evident in this disorder.

AB  - Objective: To better understand the consistent elevated symptom reporting by Gulf War veterans; we compared Australian Gulf War veterans and military-comparison group on symptom attributional styles and the relationship with total number and grouping of somatic and psychological symptoms. Method: Postal questionnaires were completed by Australian Gulf War veterans (n = 697) and military-comparison group (n = 659) in 2000-2002 and 2011-2012. Data were collected on deployments, military-psychological stressors, symptom reporting, symptom factors and attributional style (normalising, psychologising, somatising, mixed-attribution). Results: Gulf War veterans did not differ in attributional style from comparison group (p {>} 0.05); normalising was the predominant style. Groups were combined for analyses. Psychologisers reported the highest overall symptoms (mean(M) = 10.95, standard deviation(SD) = 9.15), the most psychophysiological (M = 1.71, SD = 2.82), cognitive (M = 5.79, SD = 5.09) and arthro-neuromuscular symptoms (M = 1.53, SD = 1.73). Psychologisers and somatisers reported significantly more symptoms across overall symptoms, all three symptom factors and psychological distress than normalisers. Normalisers consistently reported fewest overall symptoms (M = 2.85, SD = 4.49), psychophysiological (M = 0.40, SD = 0.98), cognitive (M = 1.14, SD = 2.22), and arthro-neuromuscular symptoms (M = 0.72, SD = 1.31). Persistent symptoms, rather than remitted, between baseline and follow-up were associated with increased rates of psychologising and mixed-attribution compared with normalising. For incident symptoms a similar pattern was observed, some symptoms also showed increased rates of somatising. Conclusions: In veterans, psychologising was associated with higher symptom reporting, whilst somatisers and mixed-attribution also demonstrated higher reporting than normalisers. Symptom persistence and incidence were associated with symptom attribution. The findings indicate that attributional style is associated with patterns of symptom reporting and highlights both past and present symptoms may influence attributional style.

AB  - Background: Traumatic stressors are important risk factors for psychiatric disorders, but people differ strikingly in their susceptibility to develop signs and symptoms of mental illness after traumatic stress. Recent studies suggest that DNA methylation could represent a prime molecular candidate mechanism regulating inter-individual differences in susceptibility to traumatic stress exposure. Methods: Our primary analyses were carried out on 96 male soldiers from an existing longitudinal Dutch military cohort assessed before and 6 months after deployment to Afghanistan. Combat trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms were measured using validated questionnaires. Methylome-wide analyses of DNA methylation profiles were performed using Illumina's 450K methylation arrays. Results: Genome-wide significant associations between longitudinal changes in methylation profiles and longitudinal alterations in PTSD symptom scores were observed for 17 loci from a total of 10 genes in trauma-exposed subjects. Mediation analyses indicated that the strength of the associations between trauma and PTSD symptom development co-depended on methylation at these loci. Blood-brain correlation analyses (using available data from another sample) on the genome-wide significant loci showed strong and statistically significant correlations between the methylation profiles in blood and those in brain. Evidence for replication for several of these 17 loci was observed in an independent longitudinal military cohort (i.e. the Marine Resiliency Study). Further, mRNA expression analyses of the identified genes in blood samples of male animals of the rodent predator scent stress model provided evidence for cross-species validation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that DNA methylation mediates the effects of combat trauma exposure on PTSD development.

AB  - Background: Trauma exposure and its mental health correlates can have negative implications for health outcomes, particularly in high-risk populations, such as military and veteran groups. Services members' exposure to potentially traumatic stressors places them at risk for reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and functioning post-deployment. However, there are a number of factors that can increase or decrease health risk in the wake of stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and alcohol misuse are associated with poor health, and thus represent potentially modifiable risk mechanisms. The present longitudinal study examined associations between key military stressors (warfare exposure, perceived threat, and sexual harassment) and post-deployment HRQOL, with a focus on the potential mediating roles of mental health symptomatology. Methods: Participants included 522 veterans (54{%} female) assessed within two years of return from deployment to Afghanistan or Iraq, and then again three years later. The DRRI-2 was administered to assess deployment factors, PTSD symptoms were assessed using the PCL-M, depression symptoms were assessed via an adapted version of the BDI-PC, alcohol misuse was assessed by the AUDIT-C, and physical and mental HRQOL/functioning were assessed using the SF-12. A regression-based path analysis framework was applied for estimating direct and indirect effects of military stressors on HRQOL. Pathways were tested in multiple mediator models, and indirect effects were examined via bootstrapping. All analyses adjusted for other deployment stressors and gender. Results: PTSD was found to be a significant mediator of warfare exposure, perceived threat, and sexual harassment as predictors of both physical and mental HRQOL. Indirect paths for depression were found for predicting mental HRQOL from perceived threat and sexual harassment. Alcohol misuse mediated the association between sexual harassment and physical HRQOL. Conclusions: Study results suggest that salient deployment stressors are associated with reduced HRQOL in the years following deployment, and that mental health symptoms play an important role in these associations. PTSD appears to be a particularly strong risk mechanism, underscoring the need for PTSD-related services, as they may reduce the likelihood for physical health problems over time. (Table Presented).

AB  - Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly comorbid and exhibit strong correlations with each other at both the symptom level and latent factor level. Various theories have attempted to explain this relationship. Results have been inconsistent regarding whether PTSD's negative alterations in cognition and mood factor (NACM) is significantly more related to depression, in contrast to other factors of PTSD. Methods Confirmatory factor analysis was used to attempt to address the relationships between PTSD and MDD in a large sample of trauma-exposed combat veterans from the Ohio National Guard as part of a larger longitudinal study. Results Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test a bifactor model of PTSD symptoms, testing relations between PTSD's factors and a latent depressive factor. After partitioning out the common variance into the bifactor, we found that in contrast to other PTSD factors, PTSD's NACM factor was not significantly more related to depression. Instead, only the general bifactor predicted depressive symptoms. Limitations The limitations of the present study include the following: the specific measures of PTSD and MDD used were based on self-report, and the sample consisted of non-clinical, non-treatment seeking veterans. Conclusions The present study suggests that the high rate of comorbidity between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder is more related to underlying general distress or negative affectivity than the symptom categories of the PTSD diagnostic criteria.

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental illness that affects current and former military service members at a disproportionately higher rate than the civilian population. Prior studies have shown that PTSD symptoms follow multiple trajectories in civilians and military personnel. The current study examines whether the trajectories of PTSD symptoms of veterans separated from the military are similar to continuously serving military personnel. The Millennium Cohort Study is a population-based study of military service members that commenced in 2001 with follow-up assessments occurring approximately every 3 years thereafter. PTSD symptoms were assessed at each time point using the PTSD Checklist. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to compare PTSD symptom trajectories between personnel who separated (veterans; n = 5292) and personnel who remained in military service (active duty; n = 16,788). Four distinct classes (resilient, delayed-onset, improving, and elevated-recovering) described PTSD symptoms trajectories in both veterans and active duty personnel. Trajectory shapes were qualitatively similar between active duty and veterans. However, within the resilient, improving, and elevated recovering classes, the shapes were statistically different. Although the low-symptom class was the most common in both groups (veterans: 82{%}; active duty: 87{%}), veterans were more likely to be classified in the other three classes (in all cases, p {<} 0.01). The shape of each trajectory was highly similar between the two groups despite differences in military and civilian life. Copyright {©} 2017

AB  - Military deployment can create significant relationship strain. Although most couples navigate the challenges of deployment successfully, this period may render some couples more vulnerable to adverse relationship outcomes such as infidelity due to a convergence of factors including geographic separation and reduced emotional and physical intimacy. Despite anecdotal reports of increased rates of infidelity during deployment, empirical findings are lacking. This study used a prospective design to examine the prevalence and risk factors of infidelity across the deployment cycle including a year-long deployment to Iraq. A total of 63 married male Airmen were assessed both pre- and 6–9 months postdeployment. The rate of sexual infidelity prior to deployment (21%) was commensurate with the lifetime rate of sexual involvement outside the marriage in representative community samples of men. Across the deployment period, the prevalence of sexual infidelity was strikingly high (22.6%) compared with annual community estimates (1.5–4%; Allen et al., 2005). Findings demonstrated that service members with a prior history of separation, steps toward divorce, and relationship distress prior to deployment had elevated risk for infidelity over the deployment cycle. Moreover, roughly 75% of Airmen who experienced infidelity over the deployment cycle divorced by 6–9 months postdeployment whereas only 5% of service members without infidelity divorced during this same time period. Considering well-documented adverse impacts of infidelity and divorce, the current findings may assist in identifying military couples at risk for infidelity and informing targeted prevention or early intervention strategies for these couples prior to or immediately following deployment.

AB  - Objective Fear et al identified a small but significant increase in probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in UK military personnel from around 3% in first year post deployment to around 6% by year 5. As yet it is not clear what factors are linked to the increase in probable PTSD, and therefore, serial measurement of poor mental health would be helpful. Method Rates of mental ill health among UK service personnel were compared upon deployment completion and at follow-up and identified factors associated with maladjustment. Results Poor mental health symptomatology increased from baseline to follow-up, PTSD symptoms and related functional impairment increased significantly. Poor baseline mental health was predictive of transition and family relationship difficulties. Conclusions The results are discussed in relation to encouraging recognition and reporting of symptoms among personnel and their social networks.

AB  - Military social workers have a responsibility to provide early interventions after potentially traumatic events (PTE). Psychological debriefings are an enduring yet controversial early intervention because of the mixed evidence regarding efficacy. Participants in various high-risk occupations favorably rate debriefings as an early intervention after PTE, and many consider debriefings as standard of care after such exposure. Some high-risk occupations continue to voice preference for debriefings, even knowing debriefing is unlikely to prevent negative mental health outcomes. The current research does not provide a rational for why participants favorably rate these interventions or what their attitudes are toward debriefings. Given the demand for early interventions to mitigate negative mental health outcomes after PTE in the military and the preference for debriefings it is important to address this gap. This study examines soldiers' global attitudes toward debriefings and in-theater debriefing experiences assessed immediately post-deployment. This study also examines combat exposure and non-traumatic deployment stressors (NTDS) as critical factors influencing mental health symptoms immediately following a combat deployment. Existing data from a longitudinal study by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and a cross-sectional exploratory design were used to examine how global attitudes toward debriefings, debriefing experiences, combat exposure, and NTDS influence posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and depressive symptoms in 2,297 soldiers who had returned from a 12-month combat deployment. The final MRA models for PTSS and depressive symptoms had three common independent predictors: NTDS, negative impact of the event debriefed, and helpfulness of a specific debriefing. Combat exposure and rank also predicted PTSS. Female gender also predicted depressive symptoms. NTDS was the strongest independent predictor of symptom severity. This is critical given the ability of military leaders to mitigate NTDS. Additionally, the negative impact of the event debriefed had greater predictive strength than total combat exposure. Helpfulness of a specific debriefing was an inverse predictor of PTSS and depressive symptoms. While global attitudes towards debriefings were not associated with mental health symptoms, soldiers who experienced a debriefing had better attitudes toward debriefings than those who did not.

AB  - Objective: We used data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study to examine long-term mental health outcomes in a large cohort of veterans, with a focus on the impact of length of service. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, 30-year cohort study of 56,205 veterans born from 1945 through 1985, including 14,702 who left military service prematurely, and 172,741 people with no record of military service, using Cox proportional hazard models, to examine the association between veteran status and length of service and cumulative risk of mental health disorder. We stratified the veterans by common lengths of service, defining Early Service Leavers as those who had served for less than 2.5 years. Results: There were 2,794 (4.97%) first episodes of any mental health disorder in veterans, compared with 7,779 (4.50%) in nonveterans. The difference was statistically significant for all veterans (adjusted hazard ratio {[}HR] = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.27; P < .001). Subgroup analysis showed the highest risk to be in Early Service Leavers (adjusted HR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30-1.50; P < .001), including those who failed to complete initial training. The risk reduced with longer service; beyond 9 years of service, risk of mental health disorder was comparable to or lower than that in nonveterans. Conclusions: The veterans at highest risk of mental health disorder were those who did not complete training or minimum engagement, while those with longest service were at reduced risk, suggesting that military service was not causative. The high risk among the earliest leavers may reflect pre-service vulnerabilities not detected at recruitment, which become apparent during early training and lead to early discharge.

AB  - Objective: This paper aims to identify the key challenges experienced by the families of defence force personnel following deployment. Method: We undertook a selective review of four post-deployment challenges to the families of defence force personnel: (1) changes to relationships; (2) changes to family member roles and responsibilities; (3) adjustment of children and parenting challenges; and (4) anger, family conflict and violence. Emerging issues in the area of post-deployment adjustment are also discussed. Results: Empirical studies of post-deployment family adjustment are lacking. Each of the reviewed challenges can contribute to psychological difficulties and precipitate contact with mental health services. Conclusions: The challenges faced by defence force personnel when returning from deployment arise within a family context. Clinicians should thoroughly assess these factors in families following deployment, but also recognise family strengths and resilience to these challenges.

AB  - Large cohort studies suggest that most military personnel experience minimal posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms following warzone deployment, an outcome often labeled resilience. Very low symptom levels, however, may be a marker for low exposure, not resilience, which requires relatively high-magnitude or high-frequency stress exposure as a precondition. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to examine the longitudinal course of lifetime PTSD symptoms following combat exposure by disaggregating deployed U.S. Marines into upper, middle, and lower tertiles of combat exposure. All factor models fit the data well; Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) values ranged from .91 to .97. Three distinct trajectories best explained the data within each tertile. The upper tertile comprised True Resilience (73.2%), New-Onset Symptoms (18.3%), and Pre-existing Symptoms (8.5%) trajectories. The middle tertile also comprised True Resilience (74.5%), New-Onset Symptoms (16)

AB  - Several studies have reported an association between traumatic stress and telomere length suggesting that traumatic stress has an impact on ageing at the cellular level. A newly derived tool provides an additional means to investigate cellular ageing by estimating epigenetic age based on DNA methylation profiles. We therefore hypothesise that in a longitudinal study of traumatic stress both indicators of cellular ageing will show increased ageing. We expect that particularly in individuals that developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases in these ageing parameters would stand out.From an existing longitudinal cohort study, ninety-six male soldiers were selected based on trauma exposure and the presence of symptoms of PTSD. All military personnel were deployed in a combat zone in Afghanistan and assessed before and 6 months after deployment. The Self-Rating Inventory for PTSD was used to measure the presence of PTSD symptoms, while exposure to combat trauma during deployment was measured with a 19-item deployment experiences checklist. These groups did not differ for age, gender, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, military rank, length, weight, or medication use. In DNA from whole blood telomere length was measured and DNA methylation levels were assessed using the Illumina 450K DNA methylation arrays. Epigenetic ageing was estimated using the DNAm age estimator procedure.The association of trauma with telomere length was in the expected direction but not significant (. B=. -10.2, p=. 0.52). However, contrary to our expectations, development of PTSD symptoms was associated with the reverse process, telomere lengthening (. B=. 1.91, p=. 0.018). In concordance, trauma significantly accelerated epigenetic ageing (. B=. 1.97, p=. 0.032) and similar to the findings in telomeres, development of PTSD symptoms was inversely associated with epigenetic ageing (. B=. -0.10, p=. 0.044). Blood cell count, medication and premorbid early life trauma exposure did not confound the results.Overall, in this longitudinal study of military personnel deployed to Afghanistan we show an acceleration of ageing by trauma. However, development of PTSD symptoms was associated with telomere lengthening and reversed epigenetic ageing. These findings warrant further study of a perhaps dysfunctional compensatory cellular ageing reversal in PTSD. Copyright {©} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This study explored the extent to which personal growth initiative (PGI) may predict posttraumatic stress and growth in student service members/veterans (SSM/V). Participants: Participants were 136 SSM/V (79% men) representing multiple branches of the armed forces. Forty-four percent of participants reported having combat experience. Methods: Data collection occurred from October 2013 to February 2014. Data were collected via a Web-based survey that included demographics and measures of personal growth initiative, posttraumatic stress, posttraumatic growth, and perceived social support. Results: Results indicated that PGI is not a unique predictor of posttraumatic stress but is a unique predictor of higher levels of posttraumatic growth. PGI appears to be at least as important as perceived social support in facilitating growth in SSM/V. Conclusions: This study provides further evidence for PGI's potential to facilitate growth after a traumatic event.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the contribution of the mission in Afghanistan to the burden of mental health problems in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). Methods: Data were obtained from the 2013 Canadian Forces Mental Health Survey, which assessed mental disorders using the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview. The sample consisted of 6696 Regular Force (RegF) personnel, 3384 of whom had deployed in support of the mission. We estimated the association of past-year mental health problems with Afghanistan deployment status, adjusting for covariates using logistic regression; population attributable fractions (PAFs) were also calculated. Results: Indication of a past-year mental disorder was identified in 18.4% (95% confidence interval {[}CI], 17.0% to 19.7%) of Afghanistan deployers compared with 14.6% (95% CI, 13.3% to 15.8%) in others. Afghanistan-related deployments contributed to the burden of a past-year disorder (PAF = 8.7%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 14.2%), with the highest PAFs being seen for panic disorder (34.7%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (32.1%). The PAFs for individual alcohol use disorders and suicide ideation were not different from zero. Child abuse, however, had a much greater PAF for any past-year disorder (28.7%; 95% CI, 23.4% to 33.7%) than did the Afghanistan mission. Conclusions: The mission in Afghanistan contributed significantly to the burden of mental disorders in the CAF RegF in 2013. However, the much stronger contribution of child abuse highlights the need for strong military mental health systems, even in peacetime, and the need to target the full range of determinants of mental health in prevention and control efforts. Objectif: Cette etude visait a estimer la contribution de la mission en Afghanistan au fardeau des problemes de sante mentale dans les Forces armees canadiennes (FAC). Methodes: Les donnees ont ete obtenues de l'Enquete de 2013 sur la sante mentale dans les Forces canadiennes (ESMFC), qui a evalue les troubles mentaux a l'aide de l'entrevue diagnostique composite internationale de l'Organisation mondiale de la sante. L'echantillon se composait de 6696 membres de la Force reguliere (Freg), dont 3384 avaient ete deployes pour soutenir la mission. Nous avons estime l'association des problemes de sante mentale de l'annee precedente avec le statut de deploiement en Afghanistan, en ajustant pour les covariables par la regression logistique; les fractions attribuables a la population (FAP) ont aussi ete calculees. Resultats: L'indication d'un trouble mental de l'annee precedente a ete identifiee chez 18,4 % (intervalle de confiance (IC) a 95 % 17,0 a 19,7 %) des deployes en Afghanistan compare a 14,6 % (IC a 95 % 13,3 a 15,8 %) chez les autres. Les deploiements lies a l'Afghanistan contribuaient au fardeau des troubles de l'annee precedente (FAP = 8,7 %; IC a 95 % 3,0 a 14,2 %), la FAP la plus elevee etant observee dans le trouble panique (34,7 %) et le trouble de stress post-traumatique (32,1 %). Les FAP des troubles individuels d'utilisation d'alcool et d'ideation suicidaire ne differaient pas de zero. Toutefois, l'enfance maltraitee avait une FAP beaucoup plus elevee que la mission en Afghanistan pour tout trouble de l'annee precedente (28,7 %; IC a 95 % 23,4 a 33,7 %). Conclusions: La mission en Afghanistan a contribue significativement au fardeau des troubles mentaux dans la Freg des FAC en 2013. Cependant, la contribution beaucoup plus elevee de l'enfance maltraitee met en evidence le besoin de systemes militaires de sante mentale solides, meme en temps de paix, et le besoin de cibler toute la gamme des determinants de la sante mentale dans le cadre des initiatives de prevention et de controle.

Data were drawn from a 6-site randomized trial of collaborative primary care for PTSD and dpression in the military. Subjects were 474 soldiers with PTSD (scores ≥ 50 on the PTSD Checklist -Civilian Version). Four assessments were completed at U.S. Army installations: baseline, and follow-ups at 3 months (92.8% response rate [RR]), 6 months (90.1% RR), and 12 months (87.1% RR). Combat exposure and 7 validated indicators of baseline clinical status (alcohol misuse, depression, pain, somatic symptoms, low mental health functioning, low physical health functioning, mild traumatic brain injury) were used to predict PTSD symptom severity on the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (Cronbach's α = .87, .92, .95, .95, at assessments 1-4, respectively).

AB  - The present research examined how particular types of combat exposure may be associated not only with increased mental health symptoms but also with perceived benefits that are associated with decreased mental health symptoms. Using a longitudinal sample of military personnel who had returned from combat in Iraq or Afghanistan, active combat experiences (such as shooting or directing fire at the enemy) were related to higher levels of perceived benefits following the deployment, whereas passive experiences (such as being the recipient of an attack or witnessing destruction) were not. Perceived benefits 3 months postdeployment were associated with lower posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms 3 months later. A mediational analysis revealed that although active combat experiences were associated with greater PTSD symptoms, a portion of this relationship was reduced as a result of the association between active combat experiences and benefit finding. Discussion focuses on additional research needed on the role of benefit finding in postcombat adjustment, and how employees may derive benefits from their work that predict future mental health symptoms.

AB  - Background: Since 2010, the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) have used post-deployment psychological screens with personnel returning from operational deployments to predict and support psychological ill-health in returning peacekeepers. Aim: The objective of this article is to discuss the critical implications of low return rates in follow-up psychological health data in returning peacekeepers. Due to low response rates at the 4-6 month follow up screen, longitudinal analysis of mental health could not be conducted. Methods: Two sets of responses were analysed using logistic regression from NZDF Post-Deployment screens with personnel who had served in Timor Leste and Afghanistan over the period 2010-2011. The total sample consisted of 695 cases. Results: This study demonstrates that peacekeeping personnel with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scores above the cut-off at the initial screen returned the follow-up (FUP) screen to a significantly lower degree than their peers.

AB  - Background Depression among U.S. military personnel has received relatively little empirical attention compared to posttraumatic stress disorder, despite evidence that depression is associated with poor psychosocial outcomes and increased suicide risk. Even less is known about factors that protect against depression in military populations. Methods A sample of 168 active duty Air Force convoy operators completed self-report measures of depression, posttraumatic stress, and sense of 'belonging' before deploying to Iraq, and again at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following their return. Linear growth modeling was used to test the associations of the variables over time. Results Mean depression scores remained low and stable across the deployment and 12-month follow-up period. Increased depression severity was significantly associated with low belonging ( P < .001) and with posttraumatic stress symptoms ( P < .001) at every time point.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore: (1) how the psychological health of the members of the first European Union Naval Force ( ME01) was affected by international deployment off the coast of Somalia; and (2) if and how organizational and personal factors (e.g., type of personnel category, previous experiences, and resilience) affected their psychological health and well-being post-deployment. The study had an exploratory longitudinal design, where the participants were assessed both before and after deployment (i.e., T1 and T2). The participants ( n = 129, 120 men, 9 women) were equally distributed between officers ( n = 68; 64 men, 4 women) and sailors ( n = 61; 56 men, 5 women). The members' average age was 31 years, ranging from 20 to 61. For the majority (78%) ME01 was their first international deployment and officers were, in general, more experienced than sailors. The overall results showed that the members' reported a positive experience with improved resilience and well-being)

AB  - IMPORTANCE The long-term course of readjustment problems in military personnel has not been evaluated in a nationally representative sample. The National Vietnam Veterans Longitudinal Study (NVVLS) is a congressionally mandated assessment of Vietnam veterans who underwent previous assessment in the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS). OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence, course, and comorbidities of war-zone posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) across a 25-year interval. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The NVVLS survey consisted of a self-report health questionnaire (n = 1409), a computer-assisted telephone survey health interview (n = 1279), and a telephone clinical interview (n = 400) in a representative national sample of veterans who served in the Vietnam theater of operations (theater veterans) from July 3, 2012, through May 17, 2013. Of 2348 NVVRS participants, 1920 were alive at the outset of the NVVLS, and 81 died during recruitment; 1450 of the remaining 1839 (78.8{%}) participated in at least 1 NVVLS study phase. Data analysis was performed from May 18, 2013, through January 9, 2015, with further analyses continued through April 13, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Study instruments included the Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD, PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV supplemented with PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 items (PCL-5+), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Nonpatient Version. RESULTS Among male theater veterans, we estimated a prevalence (95{%}CI) of 4.5{%} (1.7{%}-7.3{%}) based on CAPS-5 criteria for a current PTSD diagnosis; 10.8{%}(6.5{%}-15.1{%}) based on CAPS-5 full plus subthreshold PTSD; and 11.2{%}(8.3{%}-14.2{%}) based on PCL-5+ criteria for current war-zone PTSD. Among female veterans, estimates were 6.1{%} (1.8{%}-10.3{%}), 8.7{%} (3.8{%}-13.6{%}), and 6.6{%}(3.5{%}-9.6{%}), respectively. The PCL-5+ prevalence (95{%}CI) of current non-war-zone PTSD was 4.6{%}(2.6{%}-6.6{%}) in male and 5.1{%} (2.3{%}-8.0{%}) in female theater veterans. Comorbid major depression occurred in 36.7{%}(95{%}CI, 6.2{%}-67.2{%}) of veterans with current war-zone PTSD. With regard to the course of PTSD, 16.0{%} of theater veterans reported an increase and 7.6{%}reported a decrease of greater than 20 points in Mississippi Scale for Combat-Related PTSD symptoms. The prevalence (95{%}CI) of current PCL-5+-derived PTSD in study respondents was 1.2{%}(0.0{%}-3.0{%}) for male and 3.9{%} (0.0{%}-8.1{%}) for female Vietnam veterans. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately 271 000 Vietnam theater veterans have current full PTSD plus subthreshold war-zone PTSD, one-third of whom have current major depressive disorder, 40 or more years after the war. These findings underscore the need for mental health services for many decades for veterans with PTSD symptoms. Copyright 2015 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: Identifying trajectories of health and substance abuse is fundamental to understanding risk for negative health outcomes throughout a military serviceperson's deployment cycle. This study aims to identify sub-groups of National Guard service members who are likely to be more negatively affected by deployment in the context of "citizen soldier's" dual roles. Methods: Retrospective reports of National Guard service member surveyed approximately 2-4 months post-deployment (over 51{%} to Afghanistan) (N= 467) were collected for one year prior to the most recent deployment, during deployment and at post deployment. We used a latent growth mixture model using physical and mental health and substance use measures for three time periods to identify underlying trajectory groups. A multinomial mixed model was used to determine whether combat exposure, stress and other factors related to deployment predicted trajectory group membership. Results: The best fit four-class model identified a low risk group (n = 260) (group 1), a high risk for smoking group (n = 122) (group 2), a medium risk for mental health problems group (n = 33) (group 3) and a high risk for physical and mental health problems group (n = 52) (group 4). Significant changes in physical and mental health indicators occurred among groups 3 and 4 during and after deployment. Lower levels of education and higher post deployment alcohol use are associated with membership in group 2, while higher levels combat exposure; stress and pre-deployment family disruption are associated with membership in groups 3 and 4. Membership in group 4 was associated with higher age and lower levels of social support. Conclusions: Results suggest that physical and mental health, as well as substance use problems, worsen during and after deployment in some groups. Combat exposure appears to affect those with comorbid conditions more severely than the substance abuse group, which suggests a distinctive role of substance abuse.

AB  - The consequences of deployment extend beyond the service member to impact the entire family. The current investigation evaluated the unique challenges of family reintegration for partnered service members using a prospective design. In total, 76 partnered service members who deployed on a year-long, high-risk mission to Iraq were assessed across the entirety of the deployment cycle, i.e., pre-, during, and postdeployment. At follow-up, nearly 1 in 5 partnered service members reported moderate to severe difficulties in multiple aspects of family reintegration. Prospective interpersonal indicators such as preparations for deployment as a couple, shared commitment to the military, and predeployment relationship distress predicted postdeployment family reintegration difficulties. Significant interpersonal risk factors were medium to large in their effect sizes. Airmen’s willingness to disclose deployment- and combat-related experiences, and postdeployment relationship distress served as concurrent interpersonal correlates of difficulties with family reintegration. Intrapersonal factors, including posttraumatic stress symptoms and alcohol misuse were concurrently related to challenges with family reintegration; predeployment alcohol misuse also predicted subsequent family reintegration difficulties. Additional analyses indicated that pre- and postdeployment relationship distress, combat disclosure, and postdeployment alcohol misuse each contributed to family reintegration when controlling for other intra- and interpersonal risk factors. Implications for prevention and early intervention strategies as well as future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The association of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters with combat and other operational experiences among United Kingdom Armed Forces (UK AF) personnel who deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 were examined. Previous studies suggest that the risk of developing PTSD rises as combat exposure levels increase. To date, no UK research has investigated how specific classes of combat and operational experiences relate to PTSD symptom clusters. The current study was a secondary analysis of data derived from a two-arm cluster, randomized-controlled trial of a postdeployment operational stress-reduction intervention in deployed UK AF personnel. 2510 UK AF personnel provided combat exposure data and completed the PTSD checklist (civilian version) immediately post-deployment while 1635 of the original cohort completed further followed-up measures four to six months later. A 14-item combat experience scale was explored using principle component analysis, which yielded three main categories of experience: (1) violent combat, (2) proximity to wounding or death and (3) encountering explosive devices. The association of combat experience classes to PTSD 5-factor "dysphoric arousal" model (re-experiencing, avoidance, numbing, dysphoric-arousal and anxious-arousal symptoms) was assessed. Greater exposure to violent combat was predictive of re-experiencing and numbing symptoms, while proximity to wounding or death experiences were predictive of re-experiencing and anxious-arousal symptoms. Explosive device exposure was predictive of anxious-arousal symptoms. The present study suggests that categories of combat experience differentially impact on PTSD symptom clusters and may have relevance for clinicians treating military personnel following deployment.

AB  - There is much literature on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and male combat veterans, but little on PTSD by gender and ethnicity among women combat veterans. We examine ethnic differences in PTSD and comorbid disorders among 37 Hispanic, 27 White, and 15 Native female Operaton Enduring Freedom/ Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) combat veterans. Participants completed the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Axis I (SCID-Axis I and II), Life Events Checklist (LEC), Military Stress Exposure Questionnaire (MSEQ), and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). Hispanics differed from Whites in having less education, more trauma exposure, higher levels of PTSD, mood disorder comorbidity, and poorer physical and emotional functioning. Natives differed from Whites with more trauma exposure, higher levels of PTSD, poorer emotional functioning, and higher rates of Cluster B PDs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR], Copyright of Journal of Loss )

AB  - The mental health effects of deployment vary widely, and personnel in both combat and combat support roles, including medical personnel, may be adversely affected. To compare the mental health of deployed UK military medical staff in both forward and rear locations and to compare these two groups with other deployed military personnel. Participants were medics who had deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan and provided information about their deployed role, experiences during and on return from deployment and demographic and military factors. Health outcomes included common mental health problems (using 12-item General Health Questionnaire), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, using 17-item Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version), multiple physical symptoms and alcohol use (using 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). The sample comprised 321 medical personnel. The response rate was 56%. The mental health outcomes for forward located medics (FMs) were no different than those for rear located medics (RLMs). When comparing FMs and RLMs against all other military roles, a small but significant increase in PTSD symptoms in FMs was found. FMs were more likely to rate their work while deployed as being above their skills and experience, report exposure to more combat experiences and report a more challenging homecoming experience than RLMs. These results suggest that while the overall rates of self-reported mental health disorders were similar in FMs and RLMs, FMs reported more PTSD symptoms than all other roles, which may have been related to working in more hostile environments in more challenging roles while deployed and their experiences on returning home.

AB  - U.S. Air Force (USAF) combat search and rescue (CSAR) aircrew and special duty rescue personnel are specially trained airmen with high levels of direct exposure to combat-related medical trauma. The purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence rate of CSAR military personnel meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fifth edition; DSM-5) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom criteria. USAF CSAR aircrew (n = 128) and rescue personnel (n = 300) across multiple units participated in the study by completing a demographics survey and the PTSD checklist based on DSM-5. Fourteen participants endorsed a pattern of symptoms of moderate to extreme level of severity meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria. Recommendations are provided for line and medical leadership to optimize health and performance among CSAR personnel.

AB  - Background: Recent combat operations have involved large numbers of personnel. Long-term health effects of military deployment remain largely unknown. Objectives: To examine patterns and trends in long-term disability among combat veterans and to relate disability to aspects of wartime experience. Participants: A total of 60,228 Australian military personnel deployed between 1962 and 1975 during the Vietnam War, and 82,877 military personnel who were not deployed overseas. Outcome Measures: Accepted physician-assessed disability claims were evaluated over follow-up periods up to 50 years after deployment, and compared with age-matched controls. Multivariable analysis was used to examine differences by service branch, rank, age, and deployment duration. Results: The steepest rise in disability incidence was observed among Vietnam veterans starting in the 1990s, around 20–30 years after deployment for most veterans. After 1994, when Statements of Principles were introduced to guide evaluation of disability claims, the hazard ratio for disability incidence was 1.53 (95% confidence interval, 1.32–1.77) compared with the prior period. By January 2011, after an average follow-up of 42.5 years, 69.7% (95% confidence interval, 69.4%–70.1%) of veterans had at least 1 war-related disability. Many veterans had multiple disabilities, with leading causes being eye and ear disorders (48.0%), mental health conditions (47.9%), and musculoskeletal disorders (18.4%). For specific categories of disability, relative risks for accepted claims among veterans compared with controls were highest for mental health disorders, at 22.9 (21.9–24.0) and lowest for injuries, at 1.5 (1.4–1.6) with a relative risk for any disability of 3.7 (3.7–3.8). Veterans with service of >1 year were 2.5 (2.2–2.7) times more likely to have a mental health disability than those who served <100 days, and 2.3 (2.1–2.5) times more likely to have other disabilities. Conclusions: Long-term effects of deployment into military conflicts are substantial, and likelihood of war-related disability is associated with service history. If similar patterns follow from more recent conflicts, significant additional resources will be needed to prevent and treat long-term health conditions among veterans.

AB  - War veterans who present with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder are an ongoing epidemic. There is no way of telling what will happen during combat or how individuals will respond to potentially traumatic events. Treating war veterans has been shown to be possible to varying degrees using a multitude of applied techniques. Some researchers have found possible similarities between veterans who develop symptoms of PTSD. This researched attempted to add training to that list of possible commonalities. This research examined the variable military occupational specialty, which had not been specifically studied in the past. Army and Marine Corps participants (n = 352) were categorized as combat arms or non-combat arms and assessed for symptoms of PTSD using the military version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (Blanchard, Jones-Alexander, Buckley, & Forneris, 1996); a 17-item self-reporting Likert scale survey and compared using an ANOVA. Research question 1 asked if there were significant differences between the groups overall scores on the survey. Research question 2 asked if there were significant group differences on the subscales of the survey. Questions three and four asked if there were significant differences in scores between the groups overall when the variables rank and branch of service were accounted for, respectively. The results for all research questions suggested that there were no statistically significant differences between groups. It is suggested that future research utilize a larger sample size and geographical area. In addition, future research may want to consider also using participants not enrolled in college.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to report the mental and physical health of a population-based cohort of Gulf War and Gulf Era veterans 20 years after the war. Methods: A multimode (mail, Web, or computer-Assisted telephone interviewing) heath survey of 14,252 Gulf War and Gulf Era veterans. The survey consisted of questions about general, physical, mental, reproductive, and functional health. Results: Gulf War veterans report a higher prevalence of almost all queried physical and mental health conditions. The population as a whole, however, has a significant burden of disease including high body mass index and multiple comorbid conditions. Conclusions: Gulf War veterans continue to report poorer heath than Gulf Era veterans, 20 years after the war. Chronic disease management and interventions to improve health and wellness among both Gulf War and Gulf Era veterans are necessary.

Participants were Portuguese veterans (N = 60) divided into 2 groups: 30 suffered from chronic PTSD (nonrecovered) and 30 had remission from PTSD (recovered). Combat exposure, attachment patterns, and PTSD symptoms were assessed through self-report measures. Mediation test was performed by conducting several hierarchical regression analyses. Results showed higher attachment anxiety among nonrecovered participants. We did not find statistically significant differences between groups for both attachment avoidance and combat exposure level scores. In mediation analysis, at first step, attachment avoidance was not a significant predictor of PTSD symptoms, and attachment avoidance did not enter in subsequent analysis. Attachment anxiety was a partial mediator of the effect of combat exposure on PTSD symptoms. Implication)

AB  - The present study sought to identify predictors of alcohol misuse in an active-duty sample of United States Air Force (USAF) Security Forces Airmen using a longitudinal design targeting concurrent and prospective factors as well as predictors of increase in alcohol misuse. Given the well-documented relation between alcohol misuse and negative consequences at the individual, work, and community levels, predictors of alcohol misuse were explored to determine risk factors for developing alcohol-related problems across the deployment cycle. Based upon prior evidence for the association of sociodemographic variables, mental health symptoms, interpersonal factors, and exposure to traumatic events with alcohol misuse in other military samples, the current investigation assessed the utility of these predictors within a sample of USAF Airmen following a year-long, high-risk deployment to Iraq. Results indicated that sociodemographic variables and combat exposure were largely unrelated to alcohol misuse at either pre- or post-deployment in this sample; by comparison, intrapersonal factors such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms significantly predicted concurrent alcohol misuse at both time points. However, the most striking finding was the large effect size for the predictive utility of intimate relationship distress, especially at post-deployment. Indeed, Airmen who endorsed relationship distress at post-deployment were over seven times more likely to engage in concurrent alcohol misuse and eight times as likely to shift from drinking within recommended limits to engaging in alcohol misuse. Implications of these findings for assessment and intervention as well as future directions for research regarding alcohol misuse across the deployment cycle were examined.

AB  - Objective: Combat stress exposed soldiers may respond to post-deployment stressful life events (SLE) with increases in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), consistent with a model of stress sensitization. Several lines of research point to sensitization as a model to describe the relations between exposure to traumatic events, subsequent SLE, and symptoms of PTSD. Based on previous findings we hypothesized that immune activation, measured as a high in vitro capacity of leukocytes to produce cytokines upon stimulation, underlies stress sensitization. Methods: We assessed mitogen-induced cytokine production at 1 month, SLE at 1 year, and PTSD symptoms from 1 month up to 2 years post-deployment in soldiers returned from deployment to Afghanistan (. N=. 693). Exploratory structural equation modeling as well as latent growth models were applied. Results: The data demonstrated significant three-way interaction effects of combat stress exposure, cytokine production, and post-deployment SLE on linear change in PTSD symptoms over the first 2 years following return from deployment. In soldiers reporting high combat stress exposure, both high mitogen-stimulated T-cell cytokine production and high innate cytokine production were associated with increases in PTSD symptoms in response to post-deployment SLE. In low combat stress exposed soldiers as well as those with low cytokine production, post-deployment SLE were not associated with increases in PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: High stimulated T-cell and innate cytokine production may contribute to stress sensitization in recently deployed, high combat stress exposed soldiers. These findings suggest that detecting and eventually normalizing immune activation may potentially complement future strategies to prevent progression of PTSD symptoms following return from deployment.

AB  - The objective of this work was to examine US Soldiers self-report level of trauma while involved in a military deployment on heavy drinking and alcohol problems. We examined both within (e.g., his trauma on his alcohol) and cross spouse effects (e.g., his trauma on his partner's alcohol use) of trauma on heavy drinking and alcohol problems. We hypothesized that positive marital functioning would act as a protective factor reducing the relationship between traumatic combat exposure and alcohol problems. Data are from the baseline assessment of Operation: SAFETY (Soldiers and Families Excelling through the Years), an ongoing longitudinal study of US Army Reserve/National Guard Soldiers and their partners (N = 379 couples). Alcohol problems were assessed with the AUDIT and heavy drinking was a composite of frequency of getting drunk and frequency of binge drinking. Level of trauma while in combat was assessed with the Traumatic Events Questionnaire. Marital functioning was assessed with the Locke-Wallace Marital Adjustment Test. Among male soldiers, greater levels of trauma was significantly associated with greater AUDIT scores (p {<} 0.05) but more trauma was not associated with greater frequency of heavy drinking. Among women soldiers, there was no relationship between trauma and AUDIT scores or frequency of heavy drinking. In terms of cross spouse effects, the only association was between female soldiers' trauma and husbands'more frequent heavy drinking (p = 0.053). In the within spouse models, we examined if positive marital functioning reduced the association between his trauma exposure and AUDIT scores. The interaction was significant indicating that the impact of high levels of trauma on AUDIT scores was significantly reduced among men who reported stronger marital functioning (p {<} 0.05) compared to men with weaker marital functioning. Overall, this work demonstrated that level of trauma experienced during military deployments was significantly associated with higher levels of alcohol problems among male soldiers; however, stronger marital functioning offset the impact of trauma on alcohol problems. There was also some evidence of cross spouse effects such that female soldiers' trauma was related to partners heavy drinking. The findings suggest that pre and post-deployment training should consider methods to enhance the marital relationship.

AB  - Objective: Research suggests that the nature of combat may affect later development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in combat veterans. Studies comparing rates of PTSD across different conflicts indicate that the use of asymmetric or guerilla-style tactics by enemy fighters may result in higher rates of PTSD among U.S. military personnel than the use of symmetric tactics, which mirror tactics used by U.S. forces. Investigations of the association between enemy combat tactics and PTSD across conflicts were limited because of cohort effects and a focus on male veterans. The current study examined rates of PTSD diagnosis in a sample of male and female veterans deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), a conflict with 3 distinct phases marked by varying enemy tactics. Method: Participants were 738 veterans enrolled in Project VALOR (Veterans’ After-Discharge Longitudinal Registry) who deployed once to OIF. Participants completed a clinician interview as well as self-report measures. Results: Male veterans deployed during the OIF phase marked by asymmetric tactics were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with PTSD as those deployed during the other 2 phases, even after controlling for extent of combat exposure, demographic characteristics, and other deployment-related risk factors for PTSD. Differing rates of PTSD across the 3 OIF phases were not observed among female participants. Conclusion: The nature of combat (specifically, asymmetric enemy tactics) may be a risk factor for the development of PTSD among males. Factors other than enemy tactics may be more important to the development of PTSD among females. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Sleeping problems, their consequences and implications constitute a serious but rarely studied issue in the context of soldier deployment. Method: A representative sample of 1478 soldiers of the German armed forces was assessed 12 months after return from deployment. Sleeping problems (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; PSQI), the presence of mental disorders (DSM-IV-TR); as well as traumatic combat experiences were assessed and compared to N=880 nondeployed soldiers. Result: 41 % of soldiers with and 38 % of soldiers without deployment met diagnostic criteria for sleeping problems based on the PSQI. Traumatic combat experiences were associated with higher rates of sleeping problems (beta: 0.7, 95 % KI: 0.4-1.0,p <.001). Depending on the number of traumatic combat experiences, a higher PSQI total score was reported for soldiers with incident mental disorders (beta: 1.2, 95 % KI: 0.3-2.1, p =.011) as well as for soldiers without mental disorders (beta: 0.7, 95 % KI: 0.3-1.1,p =.001). Conclusion: Independently of the presence of mental disorders, traumatic combat experiences during deployments are likely to contribute to the extent of sleeping problems in soldiers.

AB  - Background:Deployment of soldiers is associated with considerable rates of mental disorders after redeployment.Aims: The aim of this study was to identity prevalence of probable mental disorders and associated factors among male Norwegian soldiers at a mean of 4 years following deployment to Afghanistan in 2001–2011. Methods:The retrospective questionnaire-based study invited all Norwegian veterans deployed to Afghanistan from 2001–2011 to participate. The response rate was 59%, but only the 3403 men (47.5%) who completed all items of the four different screening instruments were used to define cases with mental health problems were included. Independent variables covered deployment and post-deployment issues. Results:The prevalence of subjects with mental health problems was 5.1% (95% CI = 4.4–5.9%) of the sample. Among deployment-related factors, physical and mental problems during deployment were most strongly associated with mental health problems after deployment. Among post-depl)

AB  - Background: Inconsistent findings between studies of gender differences in mental health outcomes in military samples have left open questions of differential prevalence in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among all United States Army soldiers and in differential psychosocial and comorbid risk and protective factor profiles and their association with receipt of treatment. Methods: This study assesses the prevalence and risk factors of screening positive for PTSD for men and women based on two large, population-based Army samples obtained as part of the 2005 and 2008 U.S. Department of Defense Surveys of Health Related Behaviors among Active Duty Military Personnel. Results: The study showed that overall rates of PTSD, as measured by several cutoffs of the PTSD Checklist, are similar between active duty men and women, with rates increasing in both men and women between the two study time points. Depression and problem alcohol use were strongly associated with a positive PTSD screen)

AB  - Divergent findings from previous research examining gender differences in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among US military members deployed to the operations in Iraq or Afghanistan (recent operations) prompted this study utilizing a matching approach to examine whether risk for new-onset PTSD and PTSD severity scores differed by gender. US military members from the Millennium Cohort Study deployed in support of the recent operations were followed for approximately 7 years from baseline through 2 follow-up periods between 2001 and 2008. Propensity score matching was used to match 1 male to each female using demographic, military, and behavioral factors including baseline sexual assault. Analyses were stratified by combat experience defined as reporting at least one of five exposures during follow-up. Outcome measures included a positive screen for PTSD and severity scores measured by the PTSD Patient Checklist-Civilian Version. Discrete-time survival analysis quantified the association between gender and incident PTSD. Among 4684 matched subjects (2342 women and men), 6.7{%} of women and 6.1{%} of men developed PTSD during follow-up. Results showed no significant gender differences for the likelihood of developing PTSD or for PTSD severity scores among women and men who reported combat experience and among those who did not. This study is the first of its kind to match a large population of male and female service members on important baseline characteristics including sexual assault. Findings suggest that while combat deployed personnel develop PTSD, women do not have a significantly different risk for developing PTSD than men after experiencing combat. Copyright {©} 2015.

AB  - Objectives Many recent studies of service members returning from deployment have focused on the health impacts of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), including persistent postconcussive symptoms (PCS). However, cross-sectional study designs have made it difficult to understand the role of mental health in the etiology of persistent PCS. Methods Participants were 3319 military personnel (primarily men [90{%}] of 25-34 years [54{%}]) who had completed health surveys at basic training and after deployment, on average, 4.6 years later. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the association of PCS with demographic covariates, premilitary mental health and somatic symptoms, combat experiences and mTBI during deployment, in addition to postdeployment mental health and non-PCS somatic symptoms. Results Premilitary mental health and somatic symptoms predicted PCS even when adjusting for other variables, yielding an elevated incidence rate ratio (IRR) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; IRR = 1.23, 95{%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.41) and somatic symptoms (mild versus minimal somatic symptoms: IRR = 1.43, 95{%} CI = 1.31-1.55; moderate/severe versus minimal somatic symptoms: IRR = 1.69, 95{%} CI = 1.43-2.06), but not for depressive symptoms. When postdeployment mental health and somatic symptom measures were added to the model, the effect of premilitary somatic symptoms remained significant. Conclusions Findings point to potential etiological contributions of premilitary characteristics, particularly a tendency to experience somatic symptoms and PTSD, as well as mTBI and combat experiences, to the development of PCS. PCS were also strongly related to concurrent postdeployment mental health. Copyright {©} 2015 by the American Psychosomatic Society.

AB  - Background: Many dynamics in the relationship among military service-related disabilities, health care benefits, mental health disorders, and post-deployment homelessness among US Veterans are not well understood. Objectives: Determine whether Veterans with a disability-related discharge from military service are at higher risk for homelessness, whether Veterans Health Administration (VHA) service-connected disability benefits mitigates that risk, and whether risks associated with discharge type, service-connected disability, or the interaction between them vary as a function of mental health disorders. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of 364,997 Veterans with a disability-related or routine discharge and initial VHA encounter between 2005 and 2013. Logistic regression and survival analyses were used to estimate homelessness risk as a function of discharge status, mental health disorders, and receipt of VHA disability benefits. Results: Disability-discharged Veterans had higher rates of homelessness compared to routine discharges (15.1 verses 9.1 per 1000 person-years at risk). At the time of the first VHA encounter, mental health disorders were associated with differentially greater risk for homelessness among Veterans with a disability discharge relative to those with a routine discharge. During the first year of VHA service usage, higher levels of disability benefits were protective against homelessness among routinely-discharged Veterans, but not among disability-discharged Veterans. By 5-years, disability discharge was a risk factor for homelessness (AOR = 1.30). Conclusions: In the long-term, disability discharge is an independent risk factor for homelessness. While VHA disability benefits help mitigate homelessness risk among routinely-discharged Veterans during the early reintegration period, they may not offer sufficient protection for disability-discharged Veterans.

AB  - Objectives: Evaluate the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) or other drug use disorder (ODUD) in U.S. service members (SMs) after incident traumatic brain injury (TBI) in both the deployed and the nondeployed setting. Participants and methods: Retrospective cohort study of U.S. SMs who served on active duty from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010. The exposed cohort consisted of SMs who received an incident diagnosis of TBI during the exposure period. The unexposed cohort was populated with a 10% random sample of SMs with any other medical diagnosis over the exposure period. Results: After adjusting for various demographic factors, TBI severity, historic diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), comorbid PTSD, and comorbid mental health outcomes, the TBI cohort (n = 53,817) demonstrated elevated incident rate ratio of developing AUD (adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 1.6, p < 0.0001) as compared to an unexposed cohort (n = 151,776). The TBI cohort did not demonstrate elevated risk of ODUD as compared to the unexposed cohort (adjusted IRR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0, 1.2, p = 0.178). Conclusions: U.S. SMs diagnosed with incident TBI demonstrated increased risk of developing an AUD within 1 year of incident TBI as compared to SMs without diagnosed TBI.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Many Vietnam-era women veterans served in or near war zones and may have experienced stressful or traumatic events during their service. Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well studied among men who served in Vietnam, no major epidemiologic investigation of PTSD among women has been performed. OBJECTIVES To assess (1) the onset and prevalence of lifetime and current PTSD for women who served during the Vietnam era, stratified by wartime location (Vietnam, near Vietnam, or the United States), and (2) the extent to which wartime location was associated with PTSD, with adjustment for demographics, service characteristics, and wartime exposures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Survey of 8742women whowere active-duty military personnel in the US Armed Forces at any time from July 4, 1965, through March 28, 1973, and alive as of survey receipt as part of Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 579, HealthVIEWS. Data were obtained from mailed and telephone surveys from May 16, 2011, through August 5, 2012, and analyzed from June 26, 2013, through July 30, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime and current PTSD as measured by the PTSD module of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0; onset of PTSD; and wartime experiences as measured by theWomen'sWartime Exposure Scale-Revised. RESULTS Among the 4219 women (48.3{%}) who completed the survey and a telephone interview, the weighted prevalence (95{%}CI) of lifetime PTSD was 20.1{%} (18.3{%}-21.8{%}), 11.5{%}(9.1{%}-13.9{%}), and 14.1{%}(12.4{%}-15.8{%}) for the Vietnam, near-Vietnam, and US cohorts, respectively. The weighted prevalence (95{%}CI) of current PTSD was 15.9{%} (14.3{%}-17.5{%}), 8.1{%} (6.0{%}-10.2{%}), and 9.1{%} (7.7{%}-10.5{%}) for the 3 cohorts, respectively. Few cases of PTSD among the Vietnam or near-Vietnam cohorts were attributable to premilitary onset (weighted prevalence, 2.9{%}[95{%}CI, 2.2{%}-3.7{%}] and 2.9{%} [95{%}CI, 1.7{%}-4.2{%}], respectively). Unadjusted models for lifetime and current PTSD indicated that women who served in Vietnam were more likely to meet PTSD criteria than women who mainly served in the United States (odds ratio [OR] for lifetime PTSD, 1.53 [95{%}CI, 1.28-1.83]; OR for current PTSD, 1.89 [95{%}CI, 1.53-2.33]). When we adjusted for wartime exposures, serving in Vietnam or near Vietnam did not increase the odds of having current PTSD (adjusted ORs, 1.05 [95{%}CI, 0.75-1.46] and 0.77 [95{%}CI, 0.52-1.14], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of PTSD for the Vietnam cohort was higher than previously documented. Vietnam service significantly increased the odds of PTSD relative to US service; this effect appears to be associated with wartime exposures, especially sexual discrimination or harassment and job performance pressures. Results suggest long-lasting mental health effects of Vietnam-era service among women veterans. Copyright {©} 2015 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the 1990-1991 GulfWar (Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm), the U.S. Armed Forces deployed just under 700,000 service members to Southwest Asia and other locations. Veterans of this era have reported increased fatigue as well as musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal and neurologic symptoms when compared to the general population, but equivalent or lower disease-related mortality rates. As this veteran population ages, questions remain about the impact of possible exposures incurred in the Gulf on chronic disease development. Previously, studying the health conditions of this veteran cohort has been challenging due to the small sample sizes of past studies. To facilitate ongoing research and enable clinicians to better address the health concerns of Gulf War veterans, the VA's Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) is creating the longitudinal research cohort: GulfWar Era Cohort and Biorepository (GWECB, CSP 585). Data and specimens will be available for research on the health and health conditions of veterans of the 1990-1991 Gulf War. We describe the demographic characteristics and health concerns of the first 1180 participants in the GWECB. METHODS: Eligible veterans are those who were in the Uniformed Services during August 1990-July 1991, regardless of deployment status or current use of VA health care. Recruitment is based on a random sample of 90,000 veterans of the 1990-1991 GulfWar era, stratified by deployment in theater (50 {%}), active duty (50 {%}), Army (50 {%}), officer grade (10 {%}), race (20 {%} non-white), and sex (20 {%} non-male). The recruitment process includes a mailed invitation packet with project information, consenting documents, and a survey of health conditions and potential exposures. After returning all required documents, a blood sample is collected and stored in a central VA laboratory;DNAis extracted. RESULTS: There are currently 1180 participants. Of these, 533 (45.2 {%}) have used VA for health care in the previous 12 months, 892 (75.6 {%}) are male, and 857 (72.6 {%}) are white. The median age is 52.9 years, and 594 (50.3 {%}) are ever-smokers. Service branches are primarily Army (617, 52.3 {%}), Navy (215, 18.2 {%}), and Air Force (190, 16.1 {%}); 827 (70.1 {%}) were deployed in support of the Gulf War. A total of 528 (44.7 {%}) participants hold at least a Bachelor's degree, 836 (70.8{%}) are married/partnered, and 682 (57.8 {%}) are currently employed full-time. Participants generally report overall health as "good", with 395 (33.5 {%}) reporting fair or poor overall health. The most commonly reported everdiagnoses pertain to the circulatory (829, 70.3 {%}), musculoskeletal (652, 55.3 {%}), digestive (612, 51.9 {%}), and neurologic (550, 46.6 {%}) systems. In addition, 574 (48.6 {%}) reported vision/hearing problems and 488 (41.4 {%}) reported mental health disorders. Those who report using VA health care had higher prevalence of conditions in all systems: circulatory 78.4 vs 63.0 {%}; musculoskeletal 69.8 vs 42.8 {%}; digestive 59.3 vs 45.7 {%}; neurologic 61.4 vs 33.6 {%}; vision/hearing 58.3 vs 40.3 {%}; mental health 55.5 vs 29.4 {%}. CONCLUSIONS: In this diverse cohort of Gulf War era veterans, participants report a variety of conditions, with a higher prevalence of all conditions among those who currently use the VA healthcare system. Through collection of extensive individual-level clinical information, symptoms, deployment-related exposure history, and blood specimens, we are creating a new resource for research on the health issues of this veteran population. The inclusion of approximately 55 {%} non-users of VA care is a particular strength of this cohort. This work is positioned to support the discovery of new treatments and improved healthcare approaches for the prevalent and incident health issues found among veterans who served during the 1990-1991 Gulf War era.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Traumatic experiences are postulated mediators of the development of Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). The STRONG STAR Consortium study of PTSD provides a unique opportunity to study FMS in a large population of service members (SM) exposed to combat stress. We have previously reported a baseline 3{%} prevalence of fibromyalgia among active duty service members prior to deployment (Hildebrand et al, 2014). This cohort has now been re-assessed following deployment to a combat environment. Methods: Active duty US SM were recruited as part of a STRONG STAR Consortium study to evaluate genetic and environmental predictors of combat-related PTSD. Participants completed surveys immediately prior to overseas deployment to a combat environment and again upon return. The research classification of fibromyalgia was ascertained using the modified 2010 ACR survey criteria. Demographics, military service, and PTSD were assessed using standardized and psychometrically validated assessments. Results: Questionnaires were completed both prior to and following deployment by 1761 SM from the original cohort of 4119. The pre-deployment (pre-D) prevalence of FMS was 2{%} vs post-deployment (post-D) 8{%} (p{<}.00001, odds ratio 8.2, 95{%} CL=4.8-14.0). The prevalence of PTSD was 20{%} pre-D and 23{%} post-D (p{<}.0415, OR=1.2, 95{%} CL=1.0- 1.45). Stratification of groups by their fibromyalgia and PTSD classification revealed several trends: Among those without FMS pre-D, 13{%} of SM with pre-D PTSD developed FMS post-D (i.e., developed FMS during deployment) while only 6{%} without PTSD pre-D developed FMS post-D (p{<}.0001, OR=2.4, 95{%} CL=1.64-3.59). Among those without FMS pre- D, 23{%} with post-D PTSD developed FM, while only 3{%} of those without post-D PTSD met criteria for FMS (p{<}0001, OR=11.0, 95{%} CL=7.3-16.6). Conversely, 71{%} who met criteria for FMS pre-D also met criteria for pre-D PTSD while only 19{%} without FMS met criteria for PTSD (p{<}.00001, OR=10.2, 95{%} CL=5.0-20.9). Post-D, this ratio was similar in that 68{%} who met criteria for FMS also met criteria for PTSD while only 19{%} who did not meet criteria for FMS met criteria for PTSD (p{<}.00001, OR=9.4, 95{%} CL=6.5-13.6). For those SM gaining a new PTSD diagnosis post-D, the rate of new FMS was also significantly higher (22{%}) than for those who did not acquire new PTSD post-D (2.3{%}, p{<}.00001, OR=11.8, 95{%} CL=7.2-19.3). Conclusion: This is the first longitudinal study to assess the prevalence of FMS before and after a military deployment to a combat environment. Exposure to an environment in support of combat operations is strongly associated with an increased prevalence of FMS. Additionally, FMS and PTSD appear to be highly comorbid. Future research should consider the influence of other mental health diagnoses, repeated deployments, head injuries, genetic variations, and particular job exposures on the risk for FMS.

AB  - Background The benefit of military unit cohesion to morale and psychological resilience is well established. But it remains unclear whether unit cohesion modifies the association between deployment-related traumatic exposure and mental health problems. Aims To examine the association between unit cohesion, traumatic exposure and poor mental health [symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress and alcohol dependency] and assess whether the relationship between traumatic exposure and poor mental health differs by level of unit cohesion. Methods A self-reported cross-sectional survey of Australian military personnel deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan between 2001 and 2009. Results Among 11 411 participants, those with low levels of unit cohesion had higher odds of PTSD symptoms [aOR (95% CI): 2.54 (1.88, 3.42)], very high psychological distress [aOR (95% CI): 4.28 (3.04, 6.02)] and a high level of alcohol problems [aOR (95% CI): 1.71 (1.32, 2.22)] compared with )

AB  - This research focused on the experiences of veterans in two jail diversion programs, a traditional drug court and a new specialized variant of drug court, Veterans Treatment Court (VTC). VTC is similar to a traditional drug court with the addition of specialized components for veterans, including the addition of a Veterans Affairs (VA) justice outreach specialist, who serves as the conduit between the VA and the court. This new approach to intervention with justice-involved veterans has not previously been subject to empirical testing. In order to provide an empirical basis for the need of the VTC program and an understanding of the effects of this program, two sets of analyses were conducted. First, an analysis of seventy participants in a traditional drug court examined differences between matched pairs of veterans and civilians in regards to their drug and alcohol problems and psychiatric symptoms. Veterans were found to have significantly more severe lifetime drug histories than did their civilian counterparts, suggesting that veterans have different needs than civilians, which might be addressed in a specialized program. In the second study, 41 participants in a Veterans Treatment Court (VTC) were assessed on measures of psychopathology, substance abuse, and employment problems and interviewed regarding their trauma histories and experiences while in the program. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed the effects of differential traumas on the expression of treatment needs at intake, including psychological symptoms and substance abuse disorders. Combat trauma significantly, independently predicted post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and drug abuse symptoms at intake. While PTSD and depression were highest among those with the most severe combat exposure, drug abuse was highest among those exposed to moderate levels of combat. This suggests that even milder forms of combat exposure can have detrimental effects on functioning. Additionally, for PTSD, post-deployment trauma contributed in unique ways to symptoms above and beyond combat trauma, indicating that non-military stressors have deleterious effects on mental health among veterans. Overall, Veteran's Treatment Court participation was associated with reductions in mental health symptoms, drug abuse severity, and employment problems over time. The particular aspects of the program that contributed to this change did not differ by combat status and appeared to be additional access to services and a streamlined referral process to the VA, as well as increased participant motivation through judicial interactions and engagement with program staff. This study suggests the importance of providing trauma-informed care to ensure responsive treatment for justice-involved veterans, and underscores the notion that Veteran's Treatment Courts can be used to effectively treat the trauma-associated symptoms of combat and non-combat justice-involved veterans alike. The implications of the findings for future research and jail diversion programs development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Compliance among active duty Department of the Navy personnel varies; however, and the impact of incomplete assessments on generalizability of results is unclear. This study examines the differences between Navy and Marine Corps service members who completed both the Post-Deployment Health Assessment and Post-Deployment Health Reassessment (n = 9,452) as compared to service members who never attempted either form (n = 5,603) in fiscal year 2010. Deployment rosters, assessments, and clinical data were analyzed to determine certified assessment completion rates and incidence of certain health conditions in these populations.

AB  - Baggrund Denne unders�gelse omhandler det psykiske helbred blandt dansk personel udsendt med International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) hold 15 til Afghanistan fra februar til august 2013. Den har til form�l at afd�kke forekomsten af symptomer p� depression og posttraumatisk stresslidelse (PTSD) fra f�r udsendelsen til 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst samt identificere faktorer m�lt f�r udsendelse, der �ger s�rbarheden for at udvikle symptomer p� PTSD. Herudover vil rapporten indeholde en sammenligning af forekomsten af PTSD- og depressionssymptomer p� ISAF15 med forekomsten af symptomer p� ISAF7, der var udsendt til Afghanistan i 2009. Metode Personel, der stod for udsendelse med ISAF15 (N=659) i februar 2013, fik 5-6 uger f�r planlagt udsendelse udleveret en r�kke validerede sp�rgeskemaer, som 282 besvarede. Alle udsendte fik udleveret sp�rgeskemaer igen 2-3 m�neder efter hjemkomst (417 besvarelser) og fik tilsendt sp�rgeskemaer 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst (340 besvarelser). Ud fra disse besvarelser opg�r vi forekomsten af symptomer p� PTSD og depression, analyserer udviklingen af PTSD-symptomer over tid og identificerer s�rbarhedsfaktorer, der �ger risikoen for at tilh�re en PTSD-symptomatisk gruppe. Fordi de udsendte p� ISAF7 er unders�gt p� samme tidspunkter relativt til deres udsendelse, og med nogle af de samme m�l er det muligt at sammenligne de to hold. Resultater Forekomsten af sv�re PTSD-symptomer blandt de udsendte p� ISAF15 er < 1 % b�de f�r udsendelsen og 2-3 m�neder efter hjemkomst, men stiger til 2,8 % 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst. Den voksende andel med PTSD-symptomer 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst stemmer overens med den udvikling, man ogs� fandt for personel p� ISAF7, hvor forekomsten 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst var lidt h�jere (5,1 %), men ikke signifikant forh�jet i forhold til ISAF15. Samme billede g�r sig g�ldende for symptomer p� depression; f�r udsendelsen og 2-3 m�neder efter hjemkomst oplever ingen af de udsendte sv�re eller meget sv�re depressions-symptomer, mens det er g�ldende for 2,8 % 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst. Gennem analyse af udviklingen af PTSD-symptomer over tid ser vi, at deltagerne grupperer sig i tre forskellige symptomm�nstre: En resilient gruppe (87,6 %) oplever ved alle tre m�letidspunkter meget f� symptomer. En gruppe p� 9,7 % har meget f� PTSD-symptomer f�r udsendelse og oplever derefter en svag men st�t stigning i symptomniveau indtil 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst. Endelig finder vi en gruppe p� 2,7 % med forh�jet PTSD-symptomniveau f�r udsendelse og et svagt fald indtil 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst. I analysen af s�rbarhedsfaktorers betydning for, hvilken PTSD-symptomgruppe deltagerne tilh�rer, finder vi, at uds�ttelse for traumatiske begivenheder f�r udsendelsen samt kampeksponering under udsendelsen �ger en persons risiko for at v�re PTSD-symptomatisk efter udsendelsen. Depression f�r udsendelsen har i mods�tning til vores forventninger ikke en signifikant betydning for, hvilken PTSD-symptomgruppe man ender i. Effekten af depression var dog borderline signifikant og kan derfor med fordel unders�ges i st�rre populationer. Konklusion Unders�gelsen bekr�fter tidligere fund af, at st�rstedelen af udsendte med det danske Forsvar til Afghanistan vender hjem uden n�vnev�rdige symptomer p� PTSD eller depression. Samtidig ser vi dog en stigning i symptomer p� b�de PTSD og depression 7-8 m�neder efter hjemkomst, hvor knap 3 % oplever v�sentligt forh�jede symptomer p� PTSD og/eller depression. Som forventet er der en tendens til mindre andel med symptomer end p� ISAF7, hvor opgaverne, rammen og operationsm�nstret var anderledes. Forskellen er dog ikke signifikant. Vi finder, at tidligere uds�ttelse for traumatiske begivenheder og kampeksponering �ger risikoen for at udvikle PTSD-symptomer efter udsendelsen.

AB  - Exposure to war zone stressors is common, yet only a minority of soldiers experience clinically meaningful disturbance in psychological function. Identification of biomarkers that predict vulnerability to war zone stressors is critical for developing more effective treatment and prevention strategies not only in soldiers but also in civilians who are exposed to trauma. We investigated the role of the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) genotype in predicting the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive and anxiety symptoms as a function of war zone stressors. A prospective cohort of 133 U.S. Army soldiers with no prior history of deployment to a war zone, who were scheduled to deploy to Iraq, was recruited. Multilevel regression models were used to investigate associations between 5-HTTLPR genotype, level of war zone stressors, and reported symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety while deployed to Iraq. Level of war zone stressors was associated with symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety. Consistent with its effects on stress responsiveness, 5-HTTLPR genotype moderated the relationship between level of war zone stressors and symptoms of emotional disturbance. Specifically, soldiers carrying one or two low functioning alleles (S or LG) reported heightened symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety in response to increased levels of exposure to war zone stressors, relative to soldiers homozygous for the high functioning allele (LA). These data suggest that 5-HTTLPR genotype moderates individual sensitivity to war zone stressors and the expression of emotional disturbance including PTSD symptoms. Replication of this association along with identification of other genetic moderators of risk can inform the development of biomarkers that can predict relative resilience vs. vulnerability to stress.

AB  - Aims: Problems associated with alcohol and drug use remain a critical area for intervention development within the Department of Defense (DoD). While there is routine post deployment screening, drug problems area not documented. This study identifies predictors of testing positive for one or more drugs post deployment among 306,345 enlisted Army active duty (AD) members returning from Iraq or Afghanistan in FY2008-2011. Methods: Urinalysis tests for cocaine, heroin, THC, amphetamines, and/or designer amphetamines, routinely tested by the DoD, were examined to estimate the percent of the sample with any positive drug test 6-month to 3-year post deployment (follow up). Demographic and deployment characteristics were examined as potential predictors of a positive drug screen. Multivariate models controlled for study design variables (number of tests, last collection date relative to deployment end). Results: Of AD enlisted members, {>}80{%} with urinalysis data were analyzed. Most had at least one random test (median 4) during followup. An estimated 2.74{%}, 95{%} confidence interval CI: 2.68-2.89{%} tested positive. Controlling for design, demographics, and deployment characteristics, with increased odds of a positive drug screen were combat specialist occupation (relative to 4 other groups), in early cohort (deployment began before FY2011), short deployment (relative to 1 year, or {>}1 year), first deployment (prior deployment ended {>}365 days before index), and assigned to a Warrior Transition Unit (WTU, rather than regular military duties) upon return. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that combat specialist occupations and first deployers were most at risk. Two measures which may be proxies for returning wounded also had increased odds of a positive drug test. Knowledge of these characteristics may help target new strategies or interventions such as additional screening or brief counseling.

AB  - Background: Problem drinking that predates enlistment into military service may contribute to the overall burden of alcohol misuse in the Armed Forces; however, evidence bearing on this issue is limited. This study examines prevalence and correlates of alcohol misuse among new U.S. Army soldiers. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data were collected from soldiers reporting for basic combat training. The survey retrospectively assessed lifetime alcohol consumption and substance abuse/dependence, enabling estimation of the prevalence of lifetime binge drinking and heavy drinking in a sample of 30,583 soldiers and of probable alcohol use disorder (AUD) among 26,754 soldiers with no/minimal lifetime use of other drugs. Co-occurrence of mental disorders and other adverse outcomes with binge drinking, heavy drinking, and AUD was examined. Discrete-time survival analysis, with person-year the unit of analysis and a logistic link function, was used to estimate associations of AUD with subsequent onset of mental disorders and vice versa. Results: Weighted prevalence of lifetime binge drinking was 27.2{%} (SE = 0.4) among males and 18.9{%} (SE = 0.7) among females; respective estimates for heavy drinking were 13.9{%} (SE = 0.3) and 9.4{%} (SE = 0.4). Among soldiers with no/minimal drug use, 9.5{%} (SE = 0.2) of males and 7.2{%} (SE = 0.5) of females had lifetime AUD. Relative to no alcohol misuse, binge drinking, heavy drinking, and AUD were associated with increased odds of all mental disorders and other adverse outcomes under consideration (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 1.5 to 4.6; ps {<} 0.001). Prior mental disorders and suicidal ideation were associated with onset of AUD (AORs = 2.3 to 2.8; ps {<} 0.001), and prior AUD was associated with onset of mental disorders and suicidal ideation (AORs = 2.0 to 3.2, ps {<} 0.005). Conclusions: Strong bidirectional associations between alcohol misuse and mental disorders were observed in a cohort of soldiers beginning Army service. Conjoint recognition of alcohol misuse and mental disorders upon enlistment may provide opportunities for risk mitigation early in a soldier's career.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Many Vietnam-era women veterans served in or near war zones and may have experienced stressful or traumatic events during their service. Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is well studied among men who served in Vietnam, no major epidemiologic investigation of PTSD among women has been performed. OBJECTIVES To assess (1) the onset and prevalence of lifetime and current PTSD for women who served during the Vietnam era, stratified by wartime location (Vietnam, near Vietnam, or the United States), and (2) the extent to which wartime location was associated with PTSD, with adjustment for demographics, service characteristics, and wartime exposures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Survey of 8742 women who were active-duty military personnel in the US Armed Forces at any time from July 4, 1965, through March 28, 1973, and alive as of survey receipt as part of Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study 579, HealthVIEWS. Data were obtained from mailed and telephone surveys from May 16, 2011, through August 5, 2012, and analyzed from June 26, 2013, through July 30, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime and current PTSD as measured by the PTSD module of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0; onset of PTSD; and wartime experiences as measured by the Women’s Wartime Exposure Scale–Revised. RESULTS Among the 4219 women (48.3%) who completed the survey and a telephone interview, the weighted prevalence (95% CI) of lifetime PTSD was 20.1% (18.3%-21.8%), 11.5% (9.1%-13.9%), and 14.1%(12.4%-15.8%) for the Vietnam, near-Vietnam, and US cohorts, respectively. The weighted prevalence (95% CI) of current PTSD was 15.9% (14.3%-17.5%), 8.1% (6.0%-10.2%), and 9.1% (7.7%-10.5%) for the 3 cohorts, respectively. Few cases of PTSD among the Vietnam or near-Vietnam cohorts were attributable to premilitary onset (weighted prevalence, 2.9% [95% CI, 2.2%-3.7%] and 2.9% [95% CI, 1.7%-4.2%], respectively). Unadjusted models for lifetime and current PTSD indicated that women who served in Vietnam were more likely to meet PTSD criteria than women who mainly served in the United States (odds ratio [OR] for lifetime PTSD, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.28-1.83]; OR for current PTSD, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.53-2.33]). When we adjusted for wartime exposures, serving in Vietnam or near Vietnam did not increase the odds of having current PTSD (adjusted ORs, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.75-1.46] and 0.77 [95% CI, 0.52-1.14], respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The prevalence of PTSD for the Vietnam cohort was higher than previously documented. Vietnam service significantly increased the odds of PTSD relative to US service; this effect appears to be associated with wartime exposures, especially sexual discrimination or harassment and job performance pressures. Results suggest long-lasting mental health effects of Vietnam-era service among women veterans. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The prevalence of postdeployment mental health (PDMH) conditions in military health care personnel appears to be on par with that of other military personnel. However, there is no comprehensive analysis of incident PDMH conditions within the overall population of U.S. Air Force Medical Service personnel. This study explored the epidemiology of incident PDMH conditions among Air Force Medical Service personnel returning from deployment. A cohort survival analysis was conducted of 24,409 subjects without preexisting mental health conditions and at least one deployment during 2003-2013. Electronic health record data were used to ascertain the diagnosis of a PDMH condition. The primary outcome measure was an incident PDMH condition defined as a mental health diagnosis on at least two separate clinical encounters. The incidence of PDMH conditions was 59.74 per 1,000 person-years. Adjustment, anxiety, mood, sleep, and post-traumatic stress disorders accounted for 78% diagnoses. Protective f)

AB  - Compared to their White counterparts, Black and Hispanic Vietnam-era, male, combat veterans in the United States have experienced discrimination and increased trauma exposure during deployment and exhibited higher rates of postdeployment mental health disorders. The present study examined differences in deployment experiences and postdeployment mental health among male and female Black, Hispanic, and White veterans deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Data were drawn from a national survey of veterans (N = 924) who had returned from deployment within the last 2 years. Ethnoracial minority veterans were compared to White veterans of the same gender on deployment experiences and postdeployment mental health. The majority of comparisons did not show significant differences; however, several small group differences did emerge (.02 < η(2) < .04). Ethnoracial minority veterans reported greater perceived threat in the warzone a)

AB  - Previous studies have found deployment to combat areas to be associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and alcohol abuse, but many previous studies were limited by samples that were not representative of the deployed military as a whole. This study presents an overview of these three mental health problems associated with deployment among Air Force, Army, Marine Corp, and Navy service members returning from deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan between January 2007 and March 2008. With postdeployment health data on over 50,000 service men and women, including diagnostic information, we were able to estimate prevalence of those who screened positive for risk of each disorder in self-report data at two time points, as well as prevalence of diagnoses received during health care encounters within the military health care system. The prevalence ranges of the three disorders were consistent with previous studies using similar measures, but service )

AB  - Using a cross-sectional design, this study surveyed 144 students on campus who are service members and veterans to determine whether posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms are significantly correlated with demographic factors (e.g., age, race and marital status), risk factors (e.g., military branch and combat exposure), and resources (e.g., social support and religiosity). The results confirm previous findings on correlates of PTS symptoms, provide new information about service members on campus that are at a greater risk for PTS and highlight resources that are associated with reduced PTS symptoms. These findings not only give institutions of higher learning insight into identifying specific demographics that are at a greater risk for PTS symptoms on college campuses, but also point to ways of supporting student service members/veterans by accurately targeting existing resources to the most affected populations.

AB  - Australian male Vietnam veterans (N = 388) were assessed 22 and 36 years after their return to Australia using standardized diagnostic interviews, with added data from Army records and self-report questionnaires. Among veterans who ever had posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 50.3% had a current diagnosis at the second assessment; of those who had a current diagnosis at Wave 1, 46.9% were also current at Wave 2. Late onset occurred for 19.0% of veterans, of whom 60.8% were current at Wave 2. Multivariate analysis compared veterans with no history of PTSD (n = 231) with veterans who had ever had PTSD (n = 157) to assess risk factors for PTSD incidence; and veterans with a history, but not current PTSD (n = 78) with veterans who had current PTSD at the second assessment (n = 79) to assess risk factors for failure to remit. Incidence was associated with lower education, shorter Army training predeployment, higher combat, excess drinking, and help-seeking after return to Australia. Prev)

AB  - Given the length of combat in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere, and the role special operations forces will continue to play, we believe it is imperative to gain understanding of the psychological "wear and tear" associated with sustained combat operations on these highly specialized, highly utilized personnel. This study focused on a seldom-studied group, Air Force Special Tactics (ST) operators, to assess combat exposure, current psychological stress, and preferences for support when needed. This study assessed symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, anxiety, sleep, anger, and perceptions of help seeking in 5 ST units. Data revealed that the majority of study participants report distress levels below clinical thresholds; however, 26% struggle with generalized stress/agitation and, at smaller percentages, other distress symptoms that have negative impact on work performance. Combat experiences were comparable or higher than Army and Marine maneuver forces, and greater am)

AB  - Much of the research examining cardiovascular reactivity among those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has focused on trauma-related tasks. In numerous but not all studies, this research suggests that PTSD is associated with increased reactivity. In the current study, we examined heart rate and blood pressure reactivity to a trauma-related script-driven imagery task and a non-trauma speech task among OIF/OEF/OND veterans, a group distinguished by multiple combat deployments. One hundred and fifty-six Veterans were recruited from a VA post-deployment health clinic and completed validated self-report measures of PTSD, degree of combat exposure, and dissociation. Overall, cardiovascular reactivity was significantly associated with PTSD, dissociation and exposure scores after covarying age, sex and body mass index. For the trauma-imagery task, PTSD symptom severity was significantly related to blunted systolic blood pressure (B = -.25, p = .03) and total peripheral resistance reactivity (B = -.23, p = .04). Dissociation was associated with greater diastolic blood pressure (B = .24, p = .02), with similar trends for systolic blood pressure (B = .20, p = .06) and heart rate (B = .18, p = .09), reactivity. Greater combat exposure was associated with greater heart rate reactivity (B = .20, p = .04) to the trauma-related task. For the non-trauma speech task, PTSD symptoms were significantly associatd with blunted heart rate reactivity (Bs{>} -.23, ps {<} .04, for speech preparation and delivery), with similar trends for blunted cardiac output reactivity (Bs{>} -.21, p {<} .055). PTSD symptoms were related to greater total peripheral resistance reactivity (B = .26, p = .02) during preparation with a similar trend for speech delivery (B = .20, p = .07). Greater dissociation was related to greater systolic blood pressure reactivity during preparation (B = .22, p = .02). Combat exposure was not related to reactivity during the speech task. Results suggest that in a sample of recent military combat veterans, PTSD symptoms were not universally related to greater reactivity to trauma-related or non-trauma tasks. Instead, PTSD was related to blunted reactivity during the trauma task, and blunting of some measures of reactivity (but exaggerated vascular reactivity) during the non-trauma task. In contrast, dissociation and combat exposure were related to exaggerated reactivity. These findings suggest that the relationships between combat-related mental health outcomes and reactivity may be influenced by cohort and combat exposure.

AB  - Since the establishment of the individual augmentee role within the U.S. Navy, little research has examined this nontraditional role associated with combat units. The majority of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) research has been dedicated to Army and Marine Corps personnel with little research conducted on the Navy population. The purpose of this nonexperimental study was to identify the prevalence of combat-related PTSD symptomology for Navy personnel returning from an augmentee tour. The link between component and tour length and the presence of individual resilience factors on PTSD were examined. The theoretical foundation of this research included the cognitive link between the single and multiple exposures to traumatic events and the automatic conditioned responses related to the combat-related trauma using a retrospective view of archival datasets. Data analysis included a chi square test of independence and factoral analysis of variance to identify the combat-related PTSD symptoms and its associated variables. The sample size was a stratified random sampling of 570 cases. The results of this analysis support an association between location of tours and PTSD symptomology as well as a small effect between number of deployments and PTSD symptomology irrespective of status. These results will benefit the U.S. Navy enlisted personnel by increasing the awareness of a trend in combat-related PTSD, identify protective factors in resilience, and showcase the need for greater focus of these issues within Navy policy and leadership.

AB  - A life-threatening traumatic experience can cause physical and psychological distress, but it can also be remembered with pride from having demonstrated one's courage and abilities under severe circumstances. Characteristics of the event, early response, as well as later personal reflection, together determine the individual's response to a traumatic event. We investigated how traumatic combat experiences and retrospective appraisals of those experiences affected reports of symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression in 324 U.S. Army medics. Higher levels of combat experiences were associated with both appraisals of threat to life (r = .40) and appraisals of personal benefit of the deployment (r = .15). Threat appraisals were associated with increases (r = .33 and .29), whereas benefit appraisals were associated with decreases (r = -.28 and -.30, respectfully), in symptoms of posttraumatic stress and depression. These opposing mediation pathways led to weak or nonsignificant total)

AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental illness that affects current and former military service members at a disproportionately higher rate than the civilian population. Prior studies have shown that PTSD symptoms follow multiple trajectories in civilians and military personnel. The current study examines whether the trajectories of PTSD symptoms of veterans separated from the military are similar to continuously serving military personnel. The Millennium Cohort Study is a population-based study of military service members that commenced in 2001 with follow-up assessments occurring approximately every 3 years thereafter. PTSD symptoms were assessed at each time point using the PTSD Checklist. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to compare PTSD symptom trajectories between personnel who separated (veterans; n = 5292) and personnel who remained in military service (active duty; n = 16,788). Four distinct classes (resilient, delayed-onset, improving, and elevated-r)

AB  - Imagery analysts are critical to the intelligence capabilities of the United States Air Force (USAF) and are known as the 'eyes' of the USAF. The purpose of this study was to assess for posttraumatic disorder (PTSD) symptoms among this cohort. Of the 498 imagery analysts who participated, a total of 4.22% met provisional diagnostic criteria for PTSD as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) which was lower than established rates of PTSD (up to 18%) among military personnel returning from deployment. Implications of subclinical PTSD symptoms on occupational functioning and overall diagnostic picture are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study is one of the first to use validated screening measures to examine the rates of self-reported mental health and interpersonal problems following deployment of military mental health personnel (MMHP). Research has examined the impact of deployment on military personnel finding 10.2% to 29.0% screen positive for at least one mental health problem. However, little is known about impacts of deployment among MMHP. Utilizing health data collected three to twelve months post-deployment from a sample of 759 Air Force MMHP, this study examined rates of positive screens for psychological health or interpersonal problems, subsequent confirmation of positive screens by a medical provider upon examination, and the demographic characteristics associated with psychological health or interpersonal problems. The study found 13.9% screened positive for ``possible or probable PTSD,{''} 4.6% for depressive symptoms, 3.9% for alcohol problems, and 12.6% for interpersonal problems. In total, nearly 26% screened positive for one or more psychological or interpersonal problem. Of those who screened positive, 48.5% of depressive problems, 36.0% of PTSD, 20.0% of alcohol problems and 29.7% of interpersonal problems were confirmed upon subsequent examination by a medical provider. Those who screened positive were more likely to be (a) female, (b) separated, widowed, or divorced, (c) a mental health nurse or psychiatric nurse practitioner, and (d) deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. The significance, limitations, and implications of the results, along with recommendations for future research are discussed.

Methods: Structured interviews were performed with a nationally representative military reserve sample ( n = 2,003). Sociodemographic characteristics, military experiences, lifetime stressors, and psychiatric conditions were assessed. Depression was measured with the PHQ-9, and PTSD (deployment and non-deployment related) was assessed with the PCL-C. Results: Depression (21.63 % lifetime, 14.31 % current year, and 5.99 % current month) was more common than either deployment-related PTSD (5.49 % lifetime, 4.98 % current year, and 3.62 % current month) or non-deployment-related PTSD (5.40 % lifetime, 3.91 % current year, and 2.32 % current month), and branch-related differences were found.

AB  - Public concern about soldiers� mental health has increased over the last decade. Yet the large literature on the mental health problems of returning soldiers relies primarily on self-reported measures that may suffer from non-response bias, usually refers to older conflicts, and focuses mainly on specific diagnoses such as PTSD. Another challenge is that the differences between soldiers and non-soldiers are not necessarily causal, instead possibly reflecting an underlying propensity towards active military service. Using the objective measures of hospitalizations and the purchase of mental health medication, this paper is the first to investigate the effect of recent military deployments on a broader measure of mental health, for a full population of Danish soldiers and a comparison group of eligible men. We exploit a panel of Danish health administrative records and use propensity score matching process, using unique observables such as ability tests. Matching is helpful in both reducing the selection bias from observables and determining pre- and post-deployment period for the comparison group. Then, we estimate the effect of deployment in a difference-in-differences setting, controlling for time trends and other omitted variables affecting both groups. Overall, we find a significant and long-lasting adverse effect of military deployment on soldiers� mental health, regardless of the comparison groups and underlying assumptions.

The current study identified potential differences between middle-to-older aged men exposed to combat and those not exposed for physical health, interpersonal, and economic functioning over 10 years. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and social support were examined as moderators between combat exposure and outcomes. Methods:Data from the National Comorbidity Survey, baseline and 10-year follow-up, were utilized. Only men aged 50–65 at follow-up (N= 727) were included. Group differences between combat and non-combat men were examined. Regression analyses were performed to examine relationships between earlier combat and health, interpersonal, and economic outcomes over time, while controlling for important covariates. Results:Combat-exposed men were at increased risk for asthma, arthritis/rheumatism, lung diseases, headaches, and pain; they also had greater marital instability. However, combat-exposed)

AB  - Background: Problem drinking that predates enlistment into military service may contribute to the overall burden of alcohol misuse in the Armed Forces; however, evidence bearing on this issue is limited. This study examines prevalence and correlates of alcohol misuse among new U.S. Army soldiers. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data were collected from soldiers reporting for basic combat training. The survey retrospectively assessed lifetime alcohol consumption and substance abuse/dependence, enabling estimation of the prevalence of lifetime binge drinking and heavy drinking in a sample of 30,583 soldiers and of probable alcohol use disorder (AUD) among 26,754 soldiers with no/minimal lifetime use of other drugs. Co-occurrence of mental disorders and other adverse outcomes with binge drinking, heavy drinking, and AUD was examined. Discrete-time survival analysis, with person-year the unit of analysis and a logistic link function, was used to estimate associations of AUD with subsequent onset of mental disorders and vice versa. Results: Weighted prevalence of lifetime binge drinking was 27.2% (SE = 0.4) among males and 18.9% (SE = 0.7) among females; respective estimates for heavy drinking were 13.9% (SE = 0.3) and 9.4% (SE = 0.4). Among soldiers with no/minimal drug use, 9.5% (SE = 0.2) of males and 7.2% (SE = 0.5) of females had lifetime AUD. Relative to no alcohol misuse, binge drinking, heavy drinking, and AUD were associated with increased odds of all mental disorders and other adverse outcomes under consideration (adjusted odds ratios {[}AORs] = 1.5 to 4.6; ps < 0.001). Prior mental disorders and suicidal ideation were associated with onset of AUD (AORs = 2.3 to 2.8; ps < 0.001), and prior AUD was associated with onset of mental disorders and suicidal ideation (AORs = 2.0 to 3.2, ps < 0.005). Conclusions: Strong bidirectional associations between alcohol misuse and mental disorders were observed in a cohort of soldiers beginning Army service. Conjoint recognition of alcohol misuse and mental disorders upon enlistment may provide opportunities for risk mitigation early in a soldier's career.

AB  - This study investigated the extent to which current deployments, past deployments, and number of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan experienced by a military service member's significant other contributes to depression, anxiety, and stress. In addition, the study investigated the coping skills utilized during and after deployment. Depression, anxiety, and stress were measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). Coping skills and symptomology characteristically experienced by significant others during and after deployment were assessed using a demographic-type questionnaire created by the researcher based on a review of the literature, as well as the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (COPE) Brief Version (Brief COPE). Those significant others with a military member who had been injured had lower severity ratings of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to the group who did not have an injured military member, but these severity ratings were all in the normal range of depression across the two groups. The group of significant others whose military member was currently deployed at the time of data gathering had higher severity ratings of depression, anxiety, and stress compared to the significant others whose military members were not currently deployed. Significant others whose partner had been deployed more than two times at the time of data gathering did not use a larger number of effective coping strategies than those whose military member had only been on one deployment. It is imperative for the needs of significant others of deployed and returned from deployment military members to be recognized as vital to the overall military mission. The silent ranks are in just as much need of mental health services as their significant others, both as a prevention and maintenance tool for overall well-being.

AB  - Objective This prospective study aimed to investigate whether prior internalizing disorders (PIDs) moderate the relationship between stress exposure (SE) and the onset of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and nicotine dependence (ND) in deployed military personnel. Methods 358 male soldiers were examined directly before and 12 months after return from deployment using standardized interviews. Combat experiences, concerns about family disruptions, and difficult living and working environment were assessed as different aspects of SE. PID diagnoses (mood disorders (PMDs), anxiety disorders (PADs)) and substance use disorders were defined according to the DSM-IV-TR. Results PMDs were related to a stronger association between concerns about family disruptions and the risk of AUD onset (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 1.8–32.8, p = 0.006). The number of PID diagnoses (OR per diagnosis: 1.7, 95% CI 1.0–2.8, p = 0.036) and PADs (OR: 2.6, 95% CI 1.1–6.3, p = 0.038) were further related to a stronger association b)

AB  - Introduction Studies have shown that mental health risks related to military deployment depend on specific risk factors. Especially stressful experiences (SE) and lack of social support (SS) have been associated with deployment-related increases in mental disorders. Less is known about difficulties in emotion regulation (DER) in this context despite their well-known importance for the development and maintenance of mental disorders. To date, the number of prospective studies investigating the role of these potential risk factors for deployment-related psychopathology is limited. Objective To investigate risk factors for deployment-related increases in symptoms of common mental disorders. Aim To investigate associations between SE, SS and DER, and deployment-related increases in PTSD, major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms. Methods 358 male soldiers were assessed before and 12 months following deployment using standardized diagnostic interviews (CIDI) and embedde)

AB  - Aims: Provision and need for mental health services among military personnel are a major concern across nations. Two recent comparisons suggest higher rates of mental disorders in US and UK military personnel compared with civilians. However, these findings may not apply to other nations. Previous studies have focused on the overall effects of military service rather than the separate effects of military service and deployment. This study compared German military personnel with and without a history of deployment to sociodemographically matched civilians regarding prevalence and severity of 12-month DSM-IV mental disorders. Method: 1439 deployed soldiers (DS), 779 never deployed soldiers (NS) and 1023 civilians were assessed with an adapted version of the Munich Composite International Diagnostic interview across the same timeframe. Data were weighted using propensity score methodology to assure comparability of the three samples. Results: Compared with adjusted civilians, the prevalence of any 12-month disorder was lower in NS (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5–0.99) and did not differ in DS. Significant differences between military personnel and civilians regarding prevalence and severity of individual diagnoses were only apparent for alcohol (DS: OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1–0.6; NS: OR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1–0.6) and nicotine dependence (DS: OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3–0.6; NS: OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3–0.7) with lower values in both military samples. Elevated rates of panic/agoraphobia (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.4–5.3) and posttraumatic stress disorder (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3–8.0) were observed in DS with high combat exposure compared with civilians. Conclusions: Rates and severity of mental disorders in the German military are comparable with civilians for internalising and lower for substance use disorders. A higher risk of some disorders is reduced to DS with high combat exposure. This finding has implications for mental health service provision and the need for targeted interventions. Differences to previous US and UK studies that suggest an overall higher prevalence in military personnel might result from divergent study methods, deployment characteristics, military structures and occupational factors. Some of these factors might yield valuable targets to improve military mental health. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Combat veterans are at risk for several adverse outcomes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, hazardous alcohol use, and most critically, suicidal behaviors. The high rate of suicide in veterans has been understood as a correlate of PTSD and depression, but it is possible that certain specific types of combat experiences may lead to suicidal behaviors. Acts committed by veterans in the context of war such as killing may evoke a 'moral injury,' which leads to thoughts of ending one’s life. Method: The present exploratory research examined relationships between combat experiences and suicidal ideation (SI) and PTSD in a sample of 68 Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) veterans (91% male, mean age = 32.31 years) who had screened positive for alcohol misuse. We examined firing a weapon/killing in combat (Firing/Killing) and killing in combat (Killing) alone as predictors of SI and PTSD severity in both the full sample and men only. Results: Firing/Killing were associated with SI for the full sample and men only, and Killing showed a trend toward significance in predicting SI. Hierarchical regression analyses suggested that Firing/Killing did not predict PTSD for the full sample or men only, but Killing was predictive of PTSD for both samples. Conclusions: These results indicate that there may be differences in Firing/Killing and Killing alone in OEF/OIF veterans who screened positive for alcohol misuse. Thorough screening of combat experiences and addressing moral injury in returning combat veterans may help reduce high rates of suicide and PTSD.

AB  - Objectives: We documented the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and binge drinking in U. S. Reserve and National Guard (Reserve Component {[}RC]) personnel for each service and branch by rank, gender, and deployment status. Methods: Structured interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of RC personnel (n = 2,003). We used weighted descriptive statistics to examine the prevalence of PTSD, depression, and binge drinking. Results: The prevalence of PTSD was 6.7%, depression was 6.8%, and binge drinking was 11.5%. The prevalence of having one or more mental health problems investigated in this study was 19.8%. The prevalence of binge drinking was higher for enlisted men (14.8%) than enlisted women (2.6%). Having one or more mental health problems was nearly twice as high for enlisted men (23.4%) vs. enlisted women (12.9%). For deployed personnel, the prevalence of PTSD or having one or more mental health problems was approximately twice that of never-deployed personnel. Conclusions: Prevalence of mental health problems can inform prevention and treatment for RC personnel. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for PTSD, depression, and binge drinking. Interventions for RC personnel should consider service and branch, rank, gender, and deployment status.

AB  - Study Objectives: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are frequently co-occurring illnesses. The purpose of this study was to determine whether comorbid PTSD/OSA is associated with increased PTSD symptoms or decreased OSA severity compared to PTSD or OSA alone in recently deployed Active Duty Service Members (ADSM). Methods: Cross-sectional observational study of ADSM who returned from combat within 24 months. Participants underwent an attended diagnostic polysomnogram and were assessed for PTSD, depression, combat exposure severity, sleepiness, and sleep quality with validated clinical instruments. Results: Our study included 109 military personnel who returned from a combat deployment within 24 months with a mean age of 34.3 +/- 8.23 and BMI of 30.8 +/- 3.99. Twenty-four participants had PTSD/OSA, 68 had OSA, and 17 had PTSD. Mean PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M) scores were 62.0 +/- 8.95, 60.5 +/- 4.73, and 32.5 +/- 8.95 in PTSD/OSA, PTSD, and OSA, respectively. The mean AHI was 16.9 +/- 15.0, 18.9 +/- 17.0, and 1.73 +/- 1.3 for those with PTSD/OSA, OSA, and PTSD. PTSD symptoms and OSA severity in military personnel with comorbid PTSD/OSA were not significantly different from those with PTSD or OSA alone. On multivariate analysis, BMI was a significant predictor of OSA (OR, 1.21; 95{%} CI, 1.04-1.44) and age trended towards significance. Depression, but not OSA severity, was associated with PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: Following recent combat exposure, comorbid PTSD/OSA is not associated with increased PTSD symptoms or decreased severity of OSA. Early evaluation after traumatic exposure for comorbid OSA is indicated in PTSD patients with sleep complaints given the high co-occurrence and adverse clinical implications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the relationship between traumatic exposure on deployment and poor mental health varies by the reported level of childhood adversity experienced in Australian military veterans deployed to the Bougainville or East Timor military operations., METHODS: Cross-sectional self-reported survey data were collected in 2008 from 3,564 Australian military veterans who deployed to East Timor or Bougainville on their deployment experiences, health and recall of childhood events. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between childhood adversity, deployment exposures and mental health., RESULTS: The most common childhood adversity reported was 'not having a special teacher, youth worker or family friend who looked out for them while growing up'. On average, responders reported experiencing 3.5 adverse childhood experiences (SD 2.7) and averaged 5.3 (SD 4.9) traumatic exposures on deployment. Both childhood adversity and traumatic exposures on deployment were associated with higher odds of poorer mental health. However, there was no evidence that level of childhood adversity modified the association between traumatic exposure and mental health., CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: These findings suggest that military personnel who recalled a higher level of childhood adversity may need to be monitored for poor mental health and, if required, provided with appropriate support.

AB  - Aims: Understanding the time-course of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the underlying events, may help to identify those most at risk, and anticipate the number of individuals likely to be diagnosed after exposure to traumatic events. Method: Data from two health surveys were combined to create a cohort of 1119 Australian military personnel who deployed to the Middle East between 2000 and 2009. Changes in PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C) scores and the reporting of stressful events between the two self-reported surveys were assessed. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between the number of stressful events reported and PTSD symptoms, and assess whether those who reported new stressful events between the two surveys, were also more likely to report older events. We also assessed, using linear regression, whether higher scores on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale or the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test were associated with subsequent increases in the PCL-C in those who had experienced a stressful event, but who initially had few PTSD symptoms. Results: Overall, the mean PCL-C scores in the two surveys were similar, and 78% of responders stayed in the same PCL-C category. Only a small percentage moved from having few symptoms of PTSD (PCL-C < 30) in Survey 1 to meeting the criteria for PTSD (PCL-C ≥ 50) at Survey 2 (1% of all responders, 16% of those with PCL-C ≥ 50 at Survey 2). Personnel who reported more stressful lifetime events were more likely to score higher on the PCL-C. Only 51% reported the same stressful event on both surveys. People who reported events occurring between the two surveys were more likely to record events from before the first survey which they had not previously mentioned (OR 1.48, 95% CI (1.17, 1.88), p < 0.001), than those who did not. In people who initially had few PTSD symptoms, a higher level of psychological distress, was significantly associated with higher PCL-C scores a few years later. Conclusions: The reporting of stressful events varied over time indicating that while the impact of some stressors endure, others may increase or decline in importance. When screening for PTSD, it is important to consider both traumatic experiences on deployment and other stressful life events, as well as other mental health problems among military personnel, even if individuals do not exhibit symptoms of PTSD on an initial assessment.

AB  - Objectives To establish the level of psychological symptoms and the risk factors for possible decreased mental health among deployed UK maritime forces. Methods A survey was completed by deployed Royal Navy (RN) personnel which measured the prevalence of common mental disorder (CMD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and potential alcohol misuse. Military and operational characteristics were also measured including exposure to potentially traumatic events, problems occurring at home during the deployment, unit cohesion, leadership and morale. Associations between variables of interest were identified using binary logistic regression to generate ORs and 95% CIs adjusted for a range of potential confounding variables. Results In total, 41.2% (n= 572/1387) of respondents reported probable CMD, 7.8% (n= 109/1389) probable PTSD and 17.4% (n= 242/1387) potentially harmful alcohol use. Lower morale, cohesion, leadership and problems at home were associated with CMD; lower morale, leadership, problems at home and exposure to potentially traumatic events were associated with probable PTSD; working in ships with a smaller crew size was associated with potentially harmful alcohol use. Conclusions CMD and PTSD were more frequently reported in the maritime environment than during recent land-based deployments. Rates of potentially harmful alcohol use have reduced but remain higher than the wider military. Experiencing problems at home and exposure to potentially traumatic events were associated with experiencing poorer mental health; higher morale, cohesion and better leadership with fewer psychological symptoms.

The stress-buffering hypothesis, which predicts social relationships may moderate the association between combat exposure and subjective well-being, was also examined. Method:Data from the 2008 Health and Retirement Study (N= 2961) were used to estimate logistic regression models, focusing on three measures of subjective well-being: depression, life satisfaction, and self-reported health. Results:In the fully adjusted models, there were no statistically significant relationships between combat exposure and the three indicators of subjective well-being. However, compared to Veterans who had lower scores on the social relationship index, Veterans who had higher scores were less likely to be depressed and less likely to report poor or fair health. Veterans who had higher scores on the social relationships index reported)

AB  - We compared the effects of three treatment approaches on preschool-age children with autism spectrum disorders. Twenty-nine children received intensive behavior analytic intervention (IBT; 1:1 adult:child ratio, 25-40 h per week). A comparison group (n = 16) received intensive 'eclectic' intervention (a combination of methods, 1:1 or 1:2 ratio, 30 h per week) in public special education classrooms (designated the AP group). A second comparison group (GP) comprised 16 children in non-intensive public early intervention programs (a combination of methods, small groups, 15 h per week). Independent examiners administered standardized tests of cognitive, language, and adaptive skills to children in all three groups at intake and about 14 months after treatment began. The groups were similar on key variables at intake. At follow-up, the IBT group had higher mean standard scores in all skill domains than the AP and GP groups. The differences were statistically significant for all domains except motor skills. There were no statistically significant differences between the mean scores of the AP and GP groups. Learning rates at follow-up were also substantially higher for children in the IBT group than for either of the other two groups. These findings are consistent with other research showing that IBT is considerably more efficacious than 'eclectic' intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Caregiver–child interaction and social participation were compared in community-based daycare centers and group daycare homes. Use of group daycare homes made it possible to control for group size and adult–child ratio. 10 Ss were randomly selected from 4 facilities. Daycare homes were found to be more structured in terms of curriculum, and more flexible in terms of overall schedule and social–emotional climate. Adult–child interaction and social participation were of higher quality during structured periods in daycare homes. The adult–child interaction in both types of daycare was impersonal and neutral in affective tone. (30 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This executive summary of the final report of the National Day Care Study (NDCS) of March 1979 summarizes findings and policy recommendations, gives the background to the study and presents findings on quality and costs of center-based day care. Recommendations for federal regulations for preschool children, infants and toddlers, center characteristics, regulatory language and monitoring guidelines are indicated. The major cost/effects study of center-based day care for preschool children was conducted between 1974 and 1978 in 67 day care centers in Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle. Data from the major study and two supporting studies, a smaller research effort focusing on center day care for infants and toddlers and a national telephone survey of 3100 randomly selected centers, were analyzed. The NDCS found that higher quality care is associated with two low-cost ingredients (smaller groups of children and caregivers with child-specific education/training). The number of classroom staff per group (caregiver/child ratio) was not an important contributor to quality within the policy-relevant range of 1:5 to 1:10. Ratio was strongly related to differences in cost. Regulatory language and rules used to monitor compliance were found to influence center practices as much as the content of the regulations. The study concluded that revision of current federal day care regulations could allow the government to buy better care at slightly lower cost. More children could be better served within current budgets. (Author/RH)

AB  - Reported are background information and initial analyses of Tennessee's Project STAR, a legislatively authorized study of class size. The aim of the project was to identify causes and effects of differences in elementary school class size. Primary analyses were conducted on kindergarten data for 1985-1986. During that year, 42 school districts and 79 individual schools participated in the project. Core variables were three classroom conditions: (1) small class, defined as one teacher with about 15 students; (2) regular class, defined as one teacher with about 26 students; and (3) regular class with a teacher aide. These three classroom conditions were investigated: (1) in inner-city, suburban, urban or small city, and rural locations; (2) in relation to pupil variables (race, sex, socioeconomic status); and (3) in relation to either achievement measures (mathematics, sounds and letters, words and sentences, total reading scores) or noncognitive measures (motivation, self-concept). While the unit of data collection was the individual pupil, the primary unit of analysis was the class. The report presents tables and information concerning two comparisons among class types and three comparisons among the four locations. Findings seemed to favor the small class condition slightly. Supplementary analyses are briefly reported. (RH)

AB  - Tennessee's Project STAR (Student Teacher Achievement Ratio), a large longitudinal project involving students in kindergarten through third grade, has provided important information about class-size effects on pupil achievement and development. The project showed that small classes provided higher student outcomes and better student behaviors than either regular or regular-with-aide classes. Students of color benefit even more than white students. (MLH)

AB  - Surprisingly little is known about the social dimensions of laughter in preschool children. We studied children's responses to amusing video clips in the presence or absence of peers. The sample consisted of 9 boys and 11 girls aged 31-49 months (M 39.8, SD 4.2) who watched three cartoons under three different conditions: individually, in pairs, or in groups of 6 or 8. The social viewing conditions showed significantly higher numbers of laughs and smiles than the individual viewing condition. On average children laughed eight times as much in company as on their own and smiled almost three times as much. No differences were found between pairs and groups, and no association was found between subjective funniness ratings and group size. This suggests that the presence of even a single social partner can change behavior in response to humorous material. It supports the idea that laughter and smiles are primarily flexible social signals rather than reflexive responses to humor.

AB  - With ever-present budget cuts, teachers often use within-class achievement grouping to meet the needs of students of all ability levels but particularly high-ability students. Using a national database, this study examined the relationship between achievement grouping and the size of achievement groups on kindergarten reading growth. Additionally, it examined whether those relationships differed for kindergarteners in a gifted program. Findings suggest that achievement grouping is related to higher reading achievement, particularly when the average group size is small. Furthermore, although students provided gifted programming at the early grade of kindergarten generally experienced less kindergarten reading growth than their peers, this study suggests the use of achievement grouping provided them the opportunity and instruction to improve their reading achievement during the kindergarten year.

AB  - This report presents the results of the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES), a national longitudinal study of the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development of Head Start families; the observed quality of Head Start classrooms; and the characteristics and opinions of Head Start teachers and other program staff. The study was designed to answer four central questions: (a) Does Head Start enhance children's development and school readiness? (b) Does Head Start strengthen families as the primary nurturers of their children? (c) Does Head Start provide children with high quality educational, health, and nutritional services? and (d) How is classroom quality related to child outcomes? Subjects included a nationally stratified random sample of 3,200 children and families in 40 Head Start programs. The data were collected upon entry in the program (Fall 1997), and in the spring at the completion of one or two years of Head Start. Follow-up data were collected in the spring of the kindergarten and first grade years. Data was derived using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS), the Arnett Scale of Caregiver Behavior, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Third Edition, selected scales from the Woodcock Johnson Psycho-Educational Battery-Revised, the Social Skills Scale, and the Child Observation Rating. Analyses indicate that Head Start enhances children's growth and development. Head Start children showed significant expansion of their vocabulary, early writing skills, social skills, and cooperative behaviors over the program year. In addition, analyses indicate that the overall classroom quality was good and that Head Start classrooms have higher quality than most center-based early childhood programs. Child outcomes were linked to classroom quality; centers with higher average scores on the ECERS language scale and lower child/adult ratios had higher average center scores. Overall, the findings suggest that current Head Start programs meet or exceed both the Head Start Program Performance Standards and the NAEYC accreditation standard and that both children and families benefit from the program.

AB  - The conditions of day care quality under which infants direct secure attachment behaviors toward their day care providers were examined. Two groups of 12- to 18-month-old infants, who were experiencing either 1:4 or 1:7 caregiver-to-infant ratios, and their day care providers, were observed while they interacted in their day care centers. Caregivers' effectiveness in caring for the infants, and infants' attachment behaviors toward the day care providers, were assessed. Results showed that infants cared for in groups with more favorable ratios had more effective caregivers, and were thus more likely to direct secure attachment behaviors toward day care providers. Group size had a similar effect on infant and caregiver outcome measures, with smaller groups being associated with more effective caregiving and more secure attachment behaviors. For infants in groups with less favorable ratios, continuity of care in the same day care center was more important for the expression of secure attachment behaviors toward day care providers than was continuity of care with the same caregiver. Girls' day care providers were more effective than boys' providers, and girls, in turn, were more likely than boys to direct secure attachment behaviors toward their day care providers. (Author/SH)

AB  - A study was conducted to test the effectiveness of a preschool program which emphasized rapid attainment of basic academic concepts. The experimentals were 4- to 5-year-old lower class, predominantly Negro, children. For 2 years they received instruction 2 hours daily, 5 times a week, in a group where the pupil-teacher ratio was five to one. To induce learning at an above-average rate, positive and negative reinforcers were used. A comparison group was pretested and posttested. After the first year of instruction, results from the Stanford-Binet showed a gain of 17.14 points for the experimental group; the comparison group showed a gain of 8.07 points. After the second year of instruction, the experimental group gained an additional 8.61 points; the comparison group lost 2.96 points. Interviews with parents and observations of the participating children revealed no behavioral problems after the second week of instruction and no regressive behavior in general. (JS)

AB  - Part of a series of various Model Programs which informs educators about successful ongoing programs, the report describes the Fresno, California, preschool program that began as a pilot project serving 45 preschool, disadvantaged children during the 1964-65 academic year, and which during the 1969-70 academic year served 750 students at 19 elementary schools. The major components of the program are: 1) language, cognitive, motor, and social skill instruction; 2) adult to pupil ratio of 1:5; 3) health services; 4) intense community and parental involvement; and 5) continuing staff development. Personnel and methodology are described, with specific examples given of program activities which are designed to develop a functional English vocabulary and listening and speaking skills. Songs and poetry are especially effective in teaching the Spanish-speaking child. Results of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Tests indicate that the program has consistently raised the IQ of its participants by approximately 10 to 15 points, regardless of their ethnic origin, suggesting that the program is a continued success.

AB  - A large-scale experiment is described in which kindergarten students and teachers were randomly assigned to small and large classes within each participating school. Students remained in these classes for 2 years. At the end of each grade they were measured in reading and mathematics by standardized and curriculum-based tests. The results are definitive (a) a significant benefit accrues to students in reduced-size classes in both subject areas and (b) there is evidence that minority students in particular benefit from the smaller class environment, especially when curriculum-based tests are used as the learning criteria. A longitudinal analysis of a portion of the sample indicated that students in small classes outperform their peers in kindergarten classes of regular size and also gain more in reading outcomes during the second rear The question of why these effects are realized remains largely unanswered, but in light of these findings, is particularly important to pursue.

AB  - In order to add to the small body of literature on children's environments, a field experiment was designed to examine the relationships of child-teacher ratio and group size to a spectrum of observable children's and teacher's behaviors. The experimental conditions were created by varying child-teacher ratio and group size in the children's natural day-time setting. That is, in their own room with their own teachers. When two-year-old children in day care were observed with various child teacher ratio configurations, their general activity rate decreased as ratio increased. The teachers' behavior, on the other hand, increased from approximately equal levels at the two lower ratios to very high levels at the largest ratio. While the children's behaviors that varied with ratio are those that would be expected to do so, it is notable that children's behaviors toward peers as well as activity levels did not change as a function of ratio. This finding may be viewed as lending support to the notion that young children attempt to maintain a constant level of activity or social distance-a phenomenon observed in many organisms. The group size results can be interpreted along the same lines as the ratio data. None of the children's peer or activity behaviors were affected by changes in group size; teacher behaviors did not vary with group size, perhaps because an adult was equally accessible since child-teacher ratio was held constant.

AB  - The relationship between structural quality and process quality in early childhood education and care (ECEC) has been addressed in several studies. However, the findings are not conclusive. The present study was conducted in the Netherlands, which has a strongly regulated mid-quality ECEC system regarding structural aspects, with still considerable variation in process quality. The study employed a multi-method approach and extended the existing research in two ways. First, both observations of teacher–child interactions as well as teacher-reported developmental and educational activities were included as indicators of comprehensive emotional and educational process quality constructs. Second, to examine the relation between process quality and structural quality, commonly studied structural quality characteristics were complemented by less frequently studied measures of the professional development activities and education programs implemented at the centers. Results indicate that group size and child-to-teacher ratio are not related to emotional and educational process quality in the Dutch ECEC system. Teachers’ formal pre-service education has a positive, but small association with emotional process quality. The use of an education program and professional development activities at the center show the strongest associations with emotional and educational process quality. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

AB  - Parental perception of the effects of day care on 4-5 year old children regarding the security attachment effects of institutionalized day care on children was examined. It was hypothesized that after the initial three months of full-time institutionalized day care of their children (48 to 60 months old) parents would perceive that their infant's security attachment had changed. Parents (N = 25) who had children 4-5 years old were recruited from six Minneapolis/St. Paul day care facilities through applications for participation in the research study. The quality of the child's security attachment was assessed using the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) parent-rating scale survey. Parents were given the BASC survey prior to their child entering day care for the first time. After a three month period of enrollment in full-time day care, the same BASC survey was again filled out by the parent(s). The differences of the T-Score pre and post-test comparisons were not statistically significant. The cut-off for the level of significance was.05. In comparing the individual scales of security attachment, the results were not statistically significant. Series graphs from the BASC survey of aggression, anxiety, depression and withdrawal showed no statistically significant differences in the pre and post-test survey results. The researcher concluded that parents choosing institutionalized day care need to consider the following factors: teacher-child ratio, physical safety environment, consistency of staff versus high staff turnover, and the emotional and spiritual climate of the day care. This three month study suggests that additional longitudinal research of institutionalized day care children from a home care setting would be valuable.

AB  - Differences in children's self-regulation are assumed to be explained by genetic factors, socialization experiences, and sociodemographic risk. As for socialization, little research has addressed the influence of having siblings or attending early center based child care on emerging self-regulation. As regarding sociodemographic risk, few studies have been conducted in countries characterized by high equality and little poverty. In a longitudinal study following 1157 children, we investigated presence of siblings, center care exposure in the first 3 years of life (attendance, hours, and child group size), and family socioeconomic status (SES) as predictors of hot and cool effortful control (EC), at the child's age 48 months. The results showed that having a sibling was consistently related to better hot EC, whereas higher SES predicted better cool EC. A small effect implied that hours in center care at 36 months negatively predicted hot EC, whereas center care group size at 36 months modestly predicted better cool EC. Otherwise, center care variables were unrelated to self-regulation.

AB  - Steven Barnett and Clive Belfield examine the effects of preschool education on social mobility in the United States. They note that under current policy three- and four-year-old children from economically and educationally disadvantaged families have higher preschool attendance rates than other children. But current programs fail to enroll even half of poor three- and four-year-olds. Hispanics and children of mothers who drop out of school also participate at relatively low rates. The programs also do little to improve learning and development. The most effective programs, they explain, are intensive interventions such as the model Abecedarian and Perry Preschool programs, which feature highly qualified teachers and small group sizes. State preschool programs with the highest standards rank next, followed by Head Start and the average state program, which produce effects ranging from one-tenth to one-quarter of those of the best programs. Typical child care and family support programs rank last. Barnett and Belfield point out that preschool programs raise academic skills on average, but do not appear to have notably different effects for different groups of children, and so do not strongly enhance social mobility. In such areas as crime, welfare, and teen parenting, however, preschool seems more able to break links between parental behaviors and child outcomes. Increased investment in preschool, conclude Barnett and Belfield, could raise social mobility. Program expansions targeted to disadvantaged children would help them move up the ladder, as would a more universal set of policies from which disadvantaged children gained disproportionately. Increasing the educational effectiveness of early childhood programs would provide for greater gains in social mobility than increasing participation rates alone. The authors observe that if future expansions of preschool programs end up serving all children, not just the poorest, society as a whole would gain. Benefits would exceed costs and there would be more economic growth, but relative gains for disadvantaged children would be smaller than absolute gains because there would be some (smaller) benefits to other children.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the quality of toddler child care classrooms in the district of Porto, in the north of Portugal. One hundred and sixty classrooms for children between 1 and 3 years of age participated in this study. Results suggested the existence of poor average quality and absence of good-quality classrooms. Child-adult ratio was a statistically significant predictor of overall child care quality (with lower ratios associated with higher quality). The results of this study provide information on the applicability of ITERS-R to a new cultural and linguistic context, suggesting the need to enhance the quality of Portuguese programs serving toddlers.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of preschool quality for children's school performance at the end of primary school. We construct five structural quality indicators based on unique Danish administrative register data. 30,444 children finishing primary school's 9th grade in 2008 and who attended a formal preschool institution in 1998 are used in the analyses. OLS analyses show that three out of five quality indicators, a higher staff-per-child ratio, a higher share of male staff, and a higher share of staff with formal preschool teacher training are associated with significant improvements in children's test results in Danish. Boys benefit more from preschool quality than girls. Ethnic minority children benefit from higher staff stability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This report describes an Education Consolidation and Improvement Act-Chapter 1 program for at-risk kindergarten children in four Bellingham (Washington) elementary schools. Children in the program are included in regular kindergarten classes, which meet two full days each week and every other Friday. The children also attend the Kindergarten for Individual Developmental Success (KIDS) program on the remaining two days. Teacher-child ratio is kept low (a maximum of 2 to 12) so that children can receive individual and small group instruction. This program report includes information on (1) the goals of the KIDS program, (2) parent and community involvement, (3) professional training, (4) strong leadership, (5) methods and materials used, and (6) student progress, as well as a description of how program effectiveness was evaluated.

AB  - Studied 72 2-5 yr. Olds in preschool settings and classified interactions according to P. Jackson and B. Wolfson's 7 varieties of constraints and a taxonomy of 14 adaptations. The constraints conformed to P. Schoggen's (see R. Barker, pa, vol. 38:4049) definition of conflict environmental force units (conflict efu). 2 middle-class nursery schools and 2 head start programs were studied. These environments enabled the effects of several ecological variables structure of the daily program, spaciousness of the schoolroom, and teacher-children ratio and several personal variables age, sex, and social class on the incidence of conflict efu and adaptations to be determined. Differential linkages of the adaptations with varieties of conflict efu were also examined. The environmental variable which differentiated preschool settings was the program structure, and significant effects for age, sex, and social class were also found. (34 ref.)

AB  - This study seeks to determine whether center-based and family-based child care services differ with respect to process quality, as measured by the Educative Quality Observation Scales ( EQOS, Bourgon and Lavallée , , ), for groups of children 18 months old and younger. It also seeks to identify structural variables associated with process quality in these settings. The study included two types of regulated child care settings located in the greater Montreal area (center-based: N = 53 and family-based: N = 36). Results indicate that process quality was lower in family-based child care than in center-based child care for the majority of elements measured by the EQOS. Hierarchical regression analyses indicate that higher levels of process quality were associated with structural variables, including a lower adult-child ratio, the presence of more staff with specialized early childhood education training, and center-based care. The discussion focuses on strategies to improve these types of child care services.

AB  - The psychometric properties of the Infant-Toddler Environment Rating Scale-Revised Edition (ITERS-R) were examined using 153 classrooms from child-care centers where resources were tied to center performance. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that the scale measures one global aspect of quality. To decrease redundancy, subsets of items were selected randomly and by experts who rated items according to ease of administration and importance to quality. The shorter subsets demonstrated good discriminant validity, adequate to good psychometric properties, and high associations to the full ITERS-R score. They also demonstrated similar associations to staff education and staff-to-child ratio, as the full instrument. The best assessment of quality was demonstrated by the shortened subset that included items that assess both structural and process features of quality. Multilevel-analyses indicated that classrooms from the same providers score more similarly on ITERS-R than classrooms from other providers. The implications for using the ITERS-R in high-stakes contexts are discussed. (Contains 5 tables.)

AB  - Observed 15 girls and 15 boys in 3 daycare centers in an attempt to assess the quality of the daycare centers on the basis of their child–staff ratios. In each center a group of 4 infants (aged 18–42 mo) and a group of 6 older children (aged 43–50 mo) were observed in different contexts in which the child–staff ratios varied from 4–2 to 8–2 and from 6–2 to 12–2. Considerable differences were observed across daycare centers with respect to the modalities used to structure the environment. However, changes in child–staff ratios had no consistent effects on either the Ss' behavior or the tasks of the individual staff members. This indicates that the child–staff ratio, by itself, is not a valid criterion for judging the quality of daycare service. The need for each daycare center to explicitly define quality or service criteria is emphasized. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The extent and nature of preschool education in Europe is discussed, with reference to England and Wales, France, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Reports on preschool education in these countries give examples of both an early and a late start to compulsory education, very extensive and very limited preschool provision, and the effects of private and state support. Educational provision is made for very small numbers of children under three years of age, if at all. In most of the countries primary education is separate from preschool education and contacts between the two systems are usually limited. Countries are compared on such matters as preschool staffing, curriculum, class size, and parent involvement. Lack of resources and conflicting values are considered the main reasons for the slow growth of nursery, (or preschool) education in Europe. Suggestions are made about the policies that governments should adopt in this sphere, and about the important roles that parents and teachers should take as partners in the educational process. NH)

Helburn, 1995) are used to examine the effects of group size, staff–child ratio, and teacher qualifications on the quality of child care provided in day care centers (for infants and toddlers). The Cost, Quality, and Outcomes data are from a representative 4-state sample of day care centers with a design that makes it possible to control for unobserved differences across centers that could cause biased estimates of the effects of interest. The empirical results indicate that group size has small and statistically insignificant effects on child-care quality. A higher staff-child ratio appears to have beneficial effects on child-care quality when unobserved differences across centers are not accounted for. These effects become much smaller when unobserved differences are accounted for. The effects of teacher education and training are also generally not robust, but some measures of education and training have quantitatively and statistically significant effects even accounting for unobserved differences across centers. The implications of the results for future research on the determinants of child-care quality and for public policy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The effects of regulations governing staff-child ratio, group size, and staff qualifications in child care centers are estimated, using data on a sample of centers. The data contain measures of staff characteristics and wages, price of the service, and the developmental quality of the child care provided. Regulations vary across states, but may be endogenous to these outcomes. Estimates with state fixed effects are feasible because regulations vary within states by age group of children and job title of staff. Estimates with state fixed effects show that tougher regulations have some impact on input use, but have little or no impact on price and quality. The most striking finding is that tougher regulations reduce staff wages, suggesting that the incidence of child care regulations is on employees of day care centers.

AB  - A model for educating children in grades pre-kindergarten (PK) through third grade (3) was tested in the current study. The PK-3 Approach includes Structure (e.g., class size, teacher training) Process components (e.g., emotional & instructional classroom climate) in addition to Aligning and Coordinating children's experiences across grades PK-3. Alignment and Coordination is the lining up of standards, curricula, and assessment practices and ongoing efforts to maintain this alignment in the context of the student population. A comparative case study design was implemented in three urban public schools serving low-income student bodies, but with different fourth grade achievement outcomes in literacy and math. The main goals of the study were to: (1) examine empirical evidence regarding the relationship between a PK-3 Approach to education and fourth grade achievement outcomes; and (2) discover variations in PK-3 implementation which could then be used to modify the original model. Data from classroom observations using the CLASS, archival school records, and teacher and principal interviews were collected in order to characterize how each school operates on a daily basis, and then to compare the three school types in the context of the PK-3 Approach. Alignment and Coordination components best discriminated among the three schools, with the highest achieving school implementing within grade (horizontal) and across grade (vertical) Alignment and Coordination activities across subjects on a regular basis. The school with the next highest level of achievement implemented horizontal Alignment and Coordination for the literacy curriculum; and the lowest performing school (average for the population they served) did not implement any level of Alignment and Coordination except for monthly within grade meetings designed for teachers to agree on literacy topics to be taught. Process components discriminated between the two higher performing schools and the lowest performing school; and Structure components were either non-significant, or did not predict achievement in hypothesized directions. Alignment and Coordination moderated the relationship between teacher training (Structure) and Instructional Climate in the classroom (Process), whereby teachers with training above and beyond an M.A. in education was related to higher Instructional Climate scores in the lowest performing school, but no significant relationship was found in the two higher performing schools. Results are discussed in terms of educational policies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The early childhood sector in Singapore has witnessed vast changes in the past two decades. One of the key policy aims is to improve classroom quality. To ensure a rigorous evaluation of the quality of early childhood environments in Singapore, it is important to determine whether commonly used assessments of quality are valid indicators across different national and community contexts. This study investigated the validity of the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R) in Singapore focused on three major aspects: response process, structural, and criterion validity. Data were collected from 108 classrooms of the main providers of kindergarten programs in Singapore. Initial analyses showed that the quality indicators in most of the ECERS-R items were disordered, which indicated problems with the hypothesized response process underlying the standard ECERS-R scoring system in which high-level indicators are only rated if low-level indicators are met (stop-scoring). To deal with the problem of the "stop-scoring" method, we used the data from a full-scoring method (in which every indicator on every item was rated) in subsequent factor analyses to investigate the internal structure of the ECERS-R. Twenty-two of the 34 items were retained and found to load on two factors, one relating to activities/materials and the other related to language/interactions. Both of the identified subscales and the combined scale showed good internal consistency. The factor score on the combined scale mirrored the ECERS-R full score and could discriminate between classrooms in the top and bottom quartiles of quality scores. Findings on the relationship between the identified factors to the teacher-child ratio and to an alternative measure of classroom quality provided further evidence for criterion validity of the ECERS-R. Implications for the future development and use of the ECERS-R are discussed.

AB  - Examined the relations between center-based child care quality (CCQ) and infant cognitive and language development in 79 African-American 12-mo-old infants from low and middle income families. Structural and process measures of CCQ were collected through interviews with center director and observation of infant classroom. Results indicate CCQ positively correlated with scores on standardized assessments of cognitive development, language development, and communication skills. CCQ in child care centers and at home was positively related. Analyses that adjusted for the association between quality of care at home and in child care suggest the process measure of CCQ independently relate to infant's cognitive development, and the infant-adult ratio independently relate to infant's overall communication skills. Neither child nor family factors are found to moderate the association between CCQ and infant development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Child care homes are the most common type of child care in the U.S. for very young children who receive regular non-parental care. Compared to center-based care, much less is known about relations between structural and process quality within this type of care. Further, professional associations have developed guidelines based on number and ages of the children in the child care home, but these have been empirically examined. We asked two questions in secondary analyses of two large studies of over 300 child care homes. First, we identified the structural dimensions that best predicted global quality. Regression analyses replicated previously reported finding that caregiver training, but not ratio, was the structural characteristic that most consistently predicted observed global quality. Next, we compared observed quality of care in child care homes as a function of the professional association's guidelines regarding group size weighted by age of the children. No reliable association between quality of care and ratio guidelines obtained. These findings suggest that parents and policy makers should rely more heavily on characteristics such as caregiver training or education than on group size or child:adult ratios as they make decisions about child care homes, at least among settings in which group sizes are small to moderate.

AB  - This study of 553 infant, toddler, and preschool-center classrooms examined the association between classroom quality and both the highest level of the caregiver's formal education and whether the caregiver had attended training workshops at the center, in the community, or at professional meetings. Child care centers were randomly selected from 4 states, and 2 classrooms from each recruited center were selected for observation. Measures were taken of structural characteristics, caregiver training, process quality, and child outcomes. Results indicate that caregivers with formal education in early childhood or who attended workshops were rated as more sensitive in interactions with children and as providing higher quality care than other caregivers, even after adjusting for the caregivers' experience and differences related to state, adult-child ratios, and type of classroom. Furthermore, children in those caregivers' classes had more advanced language skills if caregivers reported either formal or informal training. The authors argue that these results are encouraging because informal training is a common mechanism used to promote better quality child care, although findings must be interpreted cautiously because they are based on caregivers' report of training.

AB  - To examine relationships between variations within daycare settings and adult caregiving behaviors, the social experiences of 40 toddlers (aged 18–22 mo) and their caregivers in family and center care were systematically observed. Caregivers were interviewed and conditions of caregiving recorded. Caregivers in both settings with fewer children in their care, who worked shorter hours, with less housework responsibilities engaged in more facilitative social stimulation, expressed more positive affect, were more responsive, and less restrictive and negative. Family daycare caregivers who worked in spaces specifically designed to be safe and appropriate for children were less restrictive of toddler activity. Adult–child ratio and caregiver training appeared to be the best indicators of quality care in center daycare, while a safe and appropriate caregiving environment and small groups appeared as quality indicators in family daycare.

AB  - Assessed the effect of small, medium, and large group size on kindergartners' listening comprehension. Approximately 120 Ss were divided by sex and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups which varied from one another only in size. To determine Ss' entry listening comprehension skill level, subtests of 4 reading tests were administered to all Ss. Those Ss participating in 1 adult to 1 child instruction, 1 adult to 7 or 8 children instruction, and 1 adult to 15 children instruction interacted daily for 10 sessions with an instructor who posed specific comprehension questions, read a carefully selected piece of children's literature, then restated the comprehension question to assess Ss' understanding of the story. All responses were recorded on a pictorial answer sheet. Ss in the control group received no instruction. Ss' exit level listening comprehension skills were reassessed by administering the same preinstruction subtests to all Ss immediately following the 10 sessions. Group size significantly affected Ss' performance, with one to one instruction resulting in the greatest gains. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As the 21st century dawns, child care is a fact of life for the majority of young children in the United States who spend at least some time in nonmaternal care before they embark on kindergarten or enter first grade. Concerns have been raised about the quality of these child care arrangements--about what kind of care children are receiving, how it varies in different types of care with different caregivers, and what structural (i.e., child-adult ratio, group size, physical characteristics of the child care setting) and caregiver characteristics (i.e., education, specialized training, experience, childrearing beliefs) are linked to the quality of care. It was our goal in this study to investigate each of these issues. First, we examined the relation between structural and caregiver characteristics and observed caregiver behavior to see which factors predicted more positive caregiving. Second, we analyzed differences in levels of positive caregiving associated with the type of child care centers, child care homes, in-home sitters, grandparents, and fathers--at three different child ages. Third, we used our observations of positive caregiving, stratified by type of care, child age, and maternal education, in conjunction with the 1995 National Household Education Survey (Hofferth, Shauman, Henke, & West, 1998), a nationally representative survey of child care usage, to extrapolate from our sample to the nation, by adjusting for bias in our estimate along these three dimensions relative to the population of 1- to 3-year-olds in the United States. To investigate these issues, we used the data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1996, 1997c, 1998b, 1999b).

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to investigate structural quality and process quality in child cares for low-income children in Pingtung County. In addition, research focus was to explore whether significant difference existed among different structural quality variables, and which structural quality variables were significantly related to the process quality. Structural quality included student/teacher ratio, group size, teachers' education level, teachers' professional training, and teachers' salary and fringe benefits. Process quality included two main parts: (1) caring and learning process quality of child cares' facilities evaluated by'-ECERS-R/FDCRS scale, including basic personal care, language quality, learning activity quality, social interaction quality, and characters needed for adulthood; (2) quality of teacher-children interaction evaluated by Arnett Scale, including positive interaction, punitiveness, tolerance, and permissiveness. Researchers used stratified random sampling technique to choose child care facilities in which low-income children enrolled from 33 towns in Pingtung County. A total of 115 child cares facilities participated in this study. Researchers used ECERS-R/FDCRS and Arnett Scale to measure child cares' process quality, and structural questionnaire to gather structural quality data. ANOVA was conducted to analyze data. The results show: (a) teachers' salary and benefits haves the strongest relationship with the process quality. The higher the teachers' level of salary and benefits, the better the process quality is; (b) teachers' welfare and educational level have an interactive effect, which has significant influences on the process quality. Discussions and suggestions related to above findings in childcare were included as well. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

A total of 43 participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or waitlist control groups. We used Parent and Teacher forms of Social Emotional Assets and Resilience Scales (SEARS). Factorial ANOVA results indicated a statistically significant interaction effect on SEARS–P Total score, Social Competence subscale, and Empathy subscale indicating positive impact of CCGPT. SEARS–T indicated no statistically significant differences between groups. Group size resulted in similar results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This is a report on government-funded kindergarten programs that were conducted in 1983-84 in more than 110 Chicago schools, most of them in poverty areas. Three funding sources and various instructional models are included in this assessment. The programs differed in format, including half day and all day programs, and in class size. Funds came from the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) Chapters 1 and 2 and from the Office of Equal Educational Opportunity (OEEO). A comparison group of similar schools with no additional funds for kindergarten also was included in this study. This evaluation discusses the effect of class size, compares half day and all day programs, and addresses the issues of inservice training, the learning environment, parent involvement, time use, teacher perceptions, student achievement, and first grade progress. Analysis of the data for this study has led to an intense look across programs at two specific variables: length of school day and pupil/teacher ratio. The final conclusions emphasize the quality and quantity of teacher time spent with children, the length and use of instructional time as critical in successful kindergarten performance, and preferred pupil/teacher ratios. The report also recommends that because the concept of all day kindergarten is still in the developmental stage, care must be taken to create guidelines for its implementation. Tables summarizing data obtained are included throughout the report. (DST)

AB  - Objectives. This study assessed outcomes for children when child care centers meet recommended care standards. Methods. Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care were used to examine the association between meeting standards for child-staff ratios, group sizes, caregiver training, and caregiver education and children's development at 24 and 36 months of age. Results. There were 5 major findings (1) most classes observed did not meet all 4 recommended standards (compliance ranged from 10% at 6 months of age to 34% at 36 months of age); (2) linear associations were found between number of standards met and child outcomes, and this was more the case at 36 months than at 24 months of age, (3) there was no evidence of threshold effects; (4) children in classes that met more standards had better school readiness and language comprehension scores as well as fewer behavior problems at 36 months of age; and (5) child outcomes were predicted by child-staff ratio at 24 months and cares giver training and education at 36 months of age. Conclusions. Outcomes were better when children met recommended child-staff ratios and recommended levels of caregiver training and educations.

AB  - With data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care, this study used structural equation modeling to test paths from structural indicators of child-care quality, specifically caregiver training and child-staff ratio, through a process indicator to child outcomes. Ss included children who were followed from birth through age 54 mo and mothers who were interviewed in person when their infants were age 1 mo. There were 3 main findings: (a) Quality of maternal caregiving was the strongest predictor of cognitive competence, as well as caregivers' ratings of social competence; (b) quality of nonmaternal caregiving was associated with cognitive competence and caregivers' ratings of social competence; and (c) there was a mediated path from both caregiver training and child-staff ratio through quality of nonmaternal caregiving to cognitive competence, as well as to caregivers' ratings of social competence, that was not accounted for entirely by family variables. These findings provide empirical support for policies that improve state regulations for caregiver training and child-staff ratios. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present study used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study – Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to explore the performance profiles of children with difficulties in mathematics. Two issues were particularly addressed in the present study– the longitudinal manifestation of math difficulties and the differential influence of early predictors on math growth rates and fifth-grade achievement for children with different subtypes of MD. The first issue was investigated by considering the stability and patterns of subgroup change for children with MD, MD-RD, RD, and TA, as well as by examining the math and reading achievement trajectories of children in different achievement subgroups. The second issue was explored by investigating how the identified kindergarten predictors influence progress in learning math and whether the effects of these kindergarten predictors vary among children in different achievement subgroups. Two main findings emerged: (a) children with MD-RD differed from children with MD and children in the comparison groups in the patterns of subtype change over time, math and reading IRT scale scores, and math and reading achievement trajectories; and (b) children's demographic characteristics, learning-related skills, math and reading performance at kindergarten entry, class size, and instructional time were all significantly predictive of their later math achievement and progress. Among the identified kindergarten predictors, only the effects of socioeconomic status and initial math knowledge vary across children in different kindergarten achievement subgroups. Despite some study limitations, the results of the present study add to the knowledge of academic development for children with difficulties in mathematics and have implications on early identification and intervention for this population.

AB  - Research Findings: The purpose of this study was to examine the potential contribution of teacher–child interactions to residualized Inhibitory Control (IC) gains over approximately a six-month period for preschoolers from predominantly low-income households. The study also explored whether the association between quality of teacher–child interactions and IC gains depends on children’s IC skills upon classroom entry and their household income-to-needs ratio. The study included 169 preschoolers from 51 classrooms in a Head Start program run by an agency in a large city in Oklahoma. Children’s IC skills were assessed in fall (time 1) and spring (time 2), and teacher–child interaction quality was observed at fall (i.e., September through November). Results from Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) did not show significant effects of high-quality teacher–child interactions on residualized IC gains over six months. However, results showed that children who initially presented poor IC skills displayed higher gains in their IC skills at spring when they were in classrooms practicing high-quality teacher–child interactions, as defined by emotional support and classroom organization. Practice or Policy: Emotionally supportive and well-organized classrooms in Head Start programs may benefit early IC development, especially for children presenting poor IC skills at classroom entry.

AB  - Evaluation findings on the Education Consolidation Improvement Act Chapter 1 and Chapter 1 Migrant Programs of the Austin (Texas) Independent School District (AISD) are reported. Included in the text of the report are: program descriptions; reading component descriptions; program impact on student achievement, Texas Educational Assessment of Minimum Skills (TEAMS) scores, and follow-up of pre-kindergarten students; and other program components including institutions for neglected and delinquent students, private schools, health services to migrant students, and parental involvement. Major findings were: (1) that the TEAMS reading performance of Chapter 1 students increased dramatically from 1986 to 1987 compared to other low achievers districtwide; (2) gains in the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills by Chapter 1, Chapter 1 Migrant, and State Compensatory Education students at the elementary level were not significantly different from the achievement gains of low achievers districtwide; and (3) reducing the pupil-to-teacher ratio to 15-to-1 in the targeted schools has not produced consistently higher achievement gains for lower achievers than has the Chapter 1 program.

AB  - This study used a randomized controlled trial design to investigate the ROOTS curriculum, a 50-lesson kindergarten mathematics intervention. Ten ROOTS-eligible students per classroom (n = 60) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a ROOTS five-student group, a ROOTS two-student group, and a no-treatment control group. Two primary research questions were investigated as part of this study: What was the overall impact of the treatment (the ROOTS intervention) as compared with the control (business as usual)? Was there a differential impact on student outcomes between the two treatment conditions (two- vs. five-student group)? Initial analyses for the first research question indicated a significant impact on three outcomes and positive but nonsignificant impacts on three additional measures. Results for the second research question, comparing the two- and five-student groups, indicated negligible and nonsignificant differences. Implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the role of initial skill in moderating intervention effects of a 50-lesson mathematics intervention program, ROOTS, for at-risk kindergarten students focused on developing whole-number concepts and skills. The study utilized a randomized block design with at-risk students (n = 592) within classrooms (n = 60) randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions (a small group of two to five students) or control condition. Proximal and distal measures were collected in the fall (pretest), spring (posttest), and winter of first grade (delayed posttest). Analyses examined the moderating effects of initial student achievement level on mathematics outcomes. Results indicated that initial skill moderated student outcomes but the relationship did not differ by group size. Implications for tiered mathematics instruction are discussed.

AB  - The authors examined the conditions that promote or discourage engagement in the classroom among kindergarten students. Engagement included learning behaviors (on-task behavior) and pro- and antisocial behavior. The authors examined 3 policy-manipulable features of kindergarten classrooms; (a) whether the class met for a half day or full day, (b) class size, and (c) whether a teacher aide was present in the classroom. Data for the study comprised a national sample of kindergarten students, their teachers and schools, from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, U.S. Department of Education. Measures of engagement were the teachers' overall ratings of classroom behavior and their ratings of individual students on academic and social engagement measures. Ratings of class behavior were related significantly to class scheduling (students in full-day kindergartens rated the poorest) and to class size (students in small classes rated as better behaved than those in large classes). Ratings of student behavior were not consistently related to class scheduling or to class size. No behavior rating was significantly related to the presence of a teacher aide: this finding adds to a plethora of negative results regarding classroom aides. Results are discussed in terms of the disjuncture between teachers' ratings of individual students, which yielded relatively little interclass variation, and global ratings of entire classes. Valid measures of class-level outcomes are needed for educators to assess class-level practices that include organisational policies and teacher approaches to instruction.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to propose and test a model of the relations between dimensions of day care, which included type of program, regulatable quality, characteristics of teacher-child interaction, and the quality of the teacher-child relationship, and their contributions to children's social competence. Classroom observations and interviews with teachers were used to evaluate the class sizes, teacher-child ratios, and teacher qualifications of the day care environments of 194 children from two nonprofit and three for-profit centers. Additionally, independent observers conducted observations of the frequency, content, and affective tone of teachers' interactions with children, the levels of security children demonstrated in the context of their relationships with teachers, and children's social competence, as assessed by classroom behavioral observations and rate of visual attention received from peers. Descriptive findings replicated previous studies by documenting a range in day care quality and indicating differences in quality by type of program. Nonprofit programs were more optimal than for-profit programs in terms of smaller class sizes, highly qualified teachers, and favorable teacher-child ratios. Furthermore, teachers in nonprofit centers interacted with children with higher overall rates of traditional teaching, conversational, and caregiving behaviors accompanied by warmth and friendliness. With respect to the relations between dimensions, analyses revealed that the full model did not fit the empirical data well because social competence did not show the expected associations with quality dimensions. There was support, however, for a path between low quality teacher-child interaction, which included control interactions and neutral teacher affect, and children's insecurity in the teacher-child relationship. Furthermore, regulatable quality was found to predict aspects of high quality teacher-child interaction, including overall rate of interaction, positive affect, and traditional teaching behaviors. Findings are discussed in terms of extending the focus of day care research beyond regulatable quality, which is important insofar as it sets the stage for meaningful classroom interactions, to examining other, more process-oriented dimensions, such as the characteristics of teacher-child interaction and the quality of the teacher-child relationship, and their influences on child outcomes.

AB  - This study examined regulatable quality and teacher-child interaction and, their influences on the quality of the attachment relationship developed by preschool children with their day care teachers. Observation and interview procedures were completed in 12 classrooms serving 194 preschoolers. Regulatable quality variables included teacher-child ratio, class size, and teacher qualifications. Teacher-child interaction was assessed with respect to rate, content (traditional, socially-oriented, or control/disciplinary style), and affective tone. Results indicated that class size and teacher-child ratio were especially variable, because classes were often combined for joint activities or were divided into small groups. Negative teacher affect occurred infrequently, but flat emotional tone was not uncommon. Controlling for child age, it was found that class size was negatively related to teacher-child ratio and teacher qualifications, and teacher-child ratio was positively related to teacher qualifications. The rate of teacher-child interaction was positively related to traditional and socially-oriented interactions. Control interactions were related to negative and neutral teacher affect, and negatively related to positive teacher affect. Class size was negatively related to interaction rate and traditional- and socially-oriented interactions. Teacher-child ratio was related to interaction rate and traditional interaction. Children's attachment security scores were negatively associated with neutral teacher affect and control interaction. The composite variables of quality and teacher-child interaction, formed from the results of a principle components analysis, were used in multiple regression analyses. Tentative support was found for paths between: (1) low quality teacher-child interaction and children's insecurity in the teacher-child relationship; and (2) regulatable quality and high quality teacher-child interaction.

AB  - Summarizes the key findings by R. Ruopp et al (1979), who examined federally subsidized childcare programs and found that the development of preschool children is affected by child–staff ratio, group size, caregiver qualifications, and other characteristics that can be regulated. A survey of 1981 state child care regulations as they pertain to these characteristics is included. It is concluded that there is little evidence that Ruopp's findings have been acted upon except in the area of caregiver qualifications.

AB  - The primary purpose of this research was to identify temperamental and environmental predictors of the mastery behavior of toddlers in child care center settings. Environmental predictors that were explored included aspects of the physical classroom environment and caregiver-child interaction, and temperamental predictors included child activity level, sociability, and difficultness as reported by caregivers. The relationship of contextual factors such as socioeconomic status, family stress and support, child care history and stability, and caregiver turnover to mastery behavior was also explored. Fifty-four toddlers (27 males and 27 females aged 11 to 17 months), their parents, and their caregivers participated in the study. Five separate hierarchical linear models were fitted to predict object-oriented, gross motor, social, social-object, and total mastery behavior. Results showed that the amount of time caregivers spent playing with objects with toddlers, the presence and organization of appropriately challenging toys and materials, and toddler activity level were positively related to mastery behavior. Temperamental and environmental characteristics interacted to predict mastery behavior; the positive involvement of caregivers with toddlers was more positively related to the mastery behavior of less sociable, less active, and more difficult toddlers compared with their more sociable, more active, and less difficult peers. Also, noise level in the classroom was more negatively related to the mastery behavior of difficult toddlers compared with easy toddlers. Contextual factors were unrelated to mastery behavior except that support experienced by the toddler's mother was positively related to involvement in challenging gross motor activities. A secondary purpose of this research was to explore the validity of an observational system developed for this study to assess mastery behavior in naturalistic child care settings. Caregiver ratings of toddlers' social persistence with adults and children using an established instrument were positively correlated with observed social and social-object mastery behavior using the new system, and caregiver ratings of toddlers' overall persistence were positively correlated with observed total mastery behavior. A final purpose of this research was to explore relationships between structural indicators of high quality child care such as group size, staff:child ratio, and caregiver education and training, and the environmental predictors of mastery behavior. Noise levels tended to be higher in rooms with larger group sizes. Toddlers in classrooms with better staff:child ratios experienced more joint play with objects as well as more positive involvement in general, on the average, with their caregivers. Caregivers with higher education levels tended to be more positively involved with toddlers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - THE COMMITTEE ON COMPENSATORY EDUCATION UNDERTOOK A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY OF CHICAGO'S PROGRAMS FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE CULTURALLY DEPRIVED. GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS MOST IN NEED OF COMPENSATORY EDUCATION WERE IDENTIFIED, AND THEIR POPULATION GROUPS STUDIED. MAJOR GROUPS RESIDING IN SUCH AREAS WERE FOUND TO BE THOSE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF ABSORBING NEW CULTURAL TRAITS--THE SPANISH-SPEAKING MIGRANT FROM MEXICO OR PUERTO RICO, THE NEGRO MIGRANT FROM POVERTY STRICKEN AREAS IN THE SOUTH, AND THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAIN WHITE. NEEDS UNIQUE TO EACH GROUP WERE IDENTIFIED IN ORDER THAT QUALITY EDUCATION COULD BE PROVIDED. BACKGROUND EXPERIENCE DIFFERENCES OF CHILDREN IN AVERAGE AND DISADVANTAGED AREAS WERE DISCUSSED. SCHOOLS IN DISADVANTAGED AREAS WERE PROVIDED WITH--EXTRA TEACHERS TO REDUCE THE TEACHER-PUPIL RATIO, ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS TO AID CLASSROOM TEACHERS, AND DIFFERENTIATED TEACHING GUIDES TO PROVIDE FOR DIVERGENT RATES OF PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT. OTHER PROGRAMS INCLUDED PRESCHOOL EDUCATION TO READY DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN FOR ENTRY INTO THE FIRST GRADE, SPECIAL SUMMER SCHOOLS DESIGNED TO BRING CHILDREN UP TO GRADE LEVEL IN ACHIEVEMENT AND TO PROVIDE CULTURAL EXPERIENCES, AND "OPPORTUNITY ROOMS" TO FACILITATE LANGUAGE TRAINING AND ABSORPTION OF NEW CULTURAL TRAITS FOR THE NONENGLISH SPEAKING PUPIL. ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS RANGING FROM ELEMENTARY THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, INCLUDING OPERATION ALPHABET, TELEVISED FOR THOSE UNABLE TO ATTEND FORMAL CLASSES, ORIENTATION PROGRAMS TO INTEREST PUPILS IN GOINT ON TO HIGH SCHOOL, AN AMERICANIZATION PROGRAM TO ASSIST THE FOREIGN BORN, AND AN URBANIZATION PROGRAM TO ASSIST THE RURAL NEWCOMER, WERE ALSO ESTABLISHED.

AB  - We use panel data from the kindergarten and 1st grade waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class to investigate whether increases in schooling inputs in the form of smaller classes "crowd out" parental inputs. We estimate child fixed-effect and fixed-effect-instrumental-variable models to identify the causal effects of class size on three types of parental involvement--parent-child interactions, parent-school interaction, and parent-financed activities for children. Our results suggest that increases in class size are associated with a decrease in parent-child interaction, no change in parent-school interaction, but an increase in parent-financed activities. The magnitude of these effects is between 3% and 7% of a standard deviation. Controlling for parental involvement in test score regressions does not change the achievement effects of class size, suggesting that the benefits of class size reduction are unlikely to be neutralized by adjustments in parental inputs, at least during the first 2 years in school.

The current study explored the prediction of children's behavioral adjustment 4 years after assessments of daycare center quality (e.g. caregiver-child interactions, caregiver-to-child ratios) and of the home and family environment (e.g. parental stress, discipline). Participants included 141 school-age children (73 girls) and their employed mothers (91% Euro-American) who had made use of full-time child care when the children were toddlers or preschoolers. Home environment factors and earlier behaviors were predictive of individual differences in adjustment 4 years later, particularly for maternal ratings of child behaviors. By contrast, indicators of center quality were generally unrelated to mother and teacher ratings of behavioral adjustment.

AB  - This study investigated the quantity of audible and intelligible ('near and clear') educator talk directly experienced by under-two-year-old infants attending early childhood education and care (ECEC) programmes and examined whether the quantity of educator talk was related to characteristics of quality in their ECEC room. Participants were 57 infants attending separate infant rooms in and around the Sydney metropolitan area, Australia. Each infant was observed for 3 h, wearing a small, custom-designed digital language processor (DLP) which digitally recorded and generated measures of 'near and clear' adult talk, unclear talk and infant vocalisations. Structural quality indicators include educator qualification, group size and educator-infant ratios, and Interaction Quality was assessed using the ITERS-R Interaction and Listening and Talking subscales. Infants' experience with 'near and clear' talk was predicted by Interaction Quality, the presence of a degree-qualified teacher and group size. 'Near and clear' talk was also significantly and positively related to the quantity of infant vocalisation and, negatively, to their level of exposure to unclear talk. Findings are discussed in terms of conceptualisations of quality in infant ECEC rooms, as well as the potentials and limitations of the 'near and clear' talk measure for use in future studies of language development in this context.

AB  - The current study investigated whether patterns of cortisol production in preschool-aged children in group care were influenced by characteristics such as group size, adult:child ratio, separation from family/parents; and quality of attention and stimulation from the childcare provider. Data were obtained from preschoolers attending home-based childcare. Cortisol levels were sampled at home and at childcare. Parents and teachers assessed the child's temperament (CBQ, TBQ). At childcare, the children were observed using the Observational Ratings of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE). Childcare characteristics were independent of family or child characteristics. In home-based childcare, children's cortisol patterns over the day correlated significantly with the amount of attention and stimulation provided by the childcare provider. Using a median split on the quality index measure of focused attention/stimulation, children in settings that were above the median exhibited no change in cortisol from home to childcare, while those in settings below the median exhibited a reversal of the typical pattern of cortisol production from morning to afternoon. At home these children exhibited the expected decrease in cortisol from morning to afternoon. Patterns of cortisol production at childcare were also correlated with child temperament with larger increases from morning to afternoon for more emotionally negative children and those with less self-control, Finally, cortisol production in home-based childcare was compared to data from children in center-based childcare and children not enrolled in full-day childcare.

AB  - Recent evidence about the effects of class size on academic achievement from randomized experiments points to positive effects of small classes. However, the evidence about the mechanism producing these effects is less clear. Some scholars have argued for mechanisms that would imply greater effects of small classes for low-achieving students. This article investigates possible differential effects of small classes on achievement using data from Project STAR, a four-year, large-scale randomized experiment on the effects of class size. We examined the differential effects of small classes for students in the bottom half and bottom quarter, respectively, of their class's achievement distribution in kindergarten. Although small class effects are somewhat larger for low-achieving students in reading, the differential effects (interactions) are not statistically significant. Moreover, the small class effects for low-achieving students in mathematics are actually smaller than those for higher achieving students. Thus while there are unambiguous positive effects of small classes on achievement, there is no evidence for differentially larger effects of small classes for lower achieving students.

AB  - Data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care were used to assess whether regulable features of child-care homes affect children’s development. Child-care homes selected were those in which there were at least two children and the care provider received payment for child care (<F>ns=164</F> when the study children were 15 months old, 172 at 24 months, and 146 at 36 months). Caregivers who were better educated and had received more recent and higher levels of training provided richer learning environments and warmer and more sensitive caregiving. Caregivers who had more child-centered beliefs about how to handle children also provided higher quality caregiving and more stimulating homes. In addition, when settings were in compliance with recommended age-weighted group size cut-offs, caregivers provided more positive caregiving. Quality of care was not related to caregivers’ age, experience, professionalism, or mental health, or to the number of children enrolled in the child-care home or whether the caregivers’ children were present. Children with more educated and trained caregivers performed better on tests of cognitive and language development. Children who received higher quality care, in homes that were more stimulating, with caregivers who were more attentive, responsive, and emotionally supportive, did better on tests of language and cognitive development and also were rated as being more cooperative. These findings make a case for regulating caregivers’ education and training and for requiring that child-care homes not exceed the recommended age-weighted group size.

AB  - Group size and treatment intensity are understudied topics in mathematics intervention research. This study examined whether the treatment intensity and overall intervention effects of an empirically validated Tier 2 mathematics intervention varied between intervention groups with 2:1 and 5:1 student-teacher ratios. Student practice opportunities and the quality of explicit instruction served as treatment intensity metrics. A total of 465 kindergarten students with mathematics difficulties from 136 intervention groups participated. Results suggested comparable performances between the 2:1 and 5:1 intervention groups on six outcome measures. Observation data indicated that student practice differed by group size. Students in the 5:1 groups received more opportunities to practice with their peers, while students in the 2:1 groups participated in more frequent and higher quality individualized practice opportunities. Implications in terms of delivering Tier 2 interventions in small-group formats and engaging at-risk learners in meaningful practice opportunities are discussed.

AB  - We use observations from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and, Youth Development (SECCYD) to compare structural and process characteristics of child care centers, family child care homes (nonrelative care in a home setting) and care by relatives for 2-, 3- and 4.5-year-old children. Type of care differences in structural and caregiver characteristics were consistent across ages: centers had higher child-to-adult ratios and bigger groups; centers had caregivers with better education, more training in early childhood, and less traditional beliefs about child rearing. Children in centers experienced more cognitive stimulation, less frequent language interactions with adults, less frequent negative interactions with adults, and less television viewing than did those in other types of care. In centers and family child care homes compared to relative settings, children engaged in more positive and negative interactions with peers and spent more time in transition and unoccupied. Curvilinear associations were found between structural features of care and family income, particularly for caregiver education and training. In contrast, process measures of caregiving rose monotonically with family income. Children from high-income families experienced more sensitive care, more cognitive stimulation, and fewer negative interactions with adults than did those from low-income families. We interpret the findings by linking the structural features and caregiver training to the cognitive and social processes observed in different types of care. Future research designed to understand the influences of child care on children's behavior might benefit from using this more nuanced description of child care experiences.

AB  - In their first few years of life, children develop prosocial behavior during everyday affective interactions with others, both within and outside their home environments. Early childcare and education (ECE) settings may be especially influential, but the mechanisms of prosocial development in these settings remain unknown. Three studies aim to inform our understanding of the social mechanisms of prosocial development in ECE contexts. Study 1 posits a structureprocess- outcome model of prosocial development and explores how ECE structural and process characteristics predict the emergence of prosocial behavior at 24 months; Study 2 examines bidirectional associations between prosocial behavior and ECE caregiving across the third year; and Study 3 determines whether experiences in ECE contexts in toddlerhood predict prosocial behavior at school entry and across elementary school. Study 1 revealed warm and positive caregiving at 15 months, but not caregiver beliefs about childrearing, to be a robust predictor of prosocial behavior at 24 months. Warm and positive caregiving was higher in in-home and family daycare settings than in centers, and in ECE settings with lower caregiver-child ratios and smaller group sizes, but was not associated with caregiver education or training. Study 2 found prosocial behavior to increase from 24 to 36 months and show moderate relative stability. Warm and positive caregiving at 24 months did not explain change in prosocial behavior from 24 to 36 months, but prosocial behavior at 24 months did account for some of the change in warm and positive caregiving over the third year, suggesting that children who exhibit higher levels of prosocial behavior elicit more warm and positive caregiving from their caregivers. Study 3 demonstrated that levels of prosocial behavior remained flat across elementary school, and found that prosocial behavior at 36 months predicted prosocial behavior at school entry, such that children who were more prosocial in toddlerhood were also more prosocial in elementary school. Together, these findings begin to chart the developmental course of prosocial behavior from emergence through late childhood and underscore the important and nuanced role that early childcare settings play in the expression and development of prosociality across the lifespan.

AB  - Literature on the influences of ratio and group size on children's development in day care is reviewed. Relatively few studies are responsible for the widely held beliefs about the influence of ratio and group size on children's development. When measured separately, ratio and group size are sometimes, but not always related to children's development. Some significant relationships are not in the expected direction. When included as variables in quality clusters, ratio and group size are more likely to be related to developmental outcomes. Group size more consistantly influences development in the expected direction than ratio. This suggests the need for increased attention to group size in the policy arena. Regardless of methodology, ratio and group size explain a relatively small portion of the variance in children's development. Ratio and group size have been found to have both direct and indirect effects on development, indicating that they are potentially valuable as proxy measures of children's experience in day care programs.

AB  - Highlights • Academic performance is lower in segregated compared to non-segregated kindergartens. • Segregation-related academic gaps widen across the kindergarten year. • Programming funded by Title I is associated with reduction in academic gaps. Abstract Since 1965 the purpose of Title I of the federal Elementary and Secondary Education Act has been to improve the educational outcomes of economically disadvantaged students and reduce achievement gaps. This paper presents analysis of data from a nationally representative sample of African American and Latinx kindergartners who attended public schools operating school-wide Title I programs in the 2010–11 school year. The purpose of analysis was to examine the associations between Title I programming and achievement gaps. The results indicated that African American students in high poverty, high minority schools made greater gains in reading in schools that used Title I for reduced class size. African American and Latinx students in high poverty, high minority schools made greater gains in mathematics in schools that used Title I for professional development. Findings were scrutinized via propensity score weighting, which revealed the tangled nature of school context, child and family characteristics, and student learning. Suggestions for future research include random assignment studies and local partnerships to determine effective uses of Title I monies.

AB  - This paper examines the relationship between class size and student achievement at the kindergarten level. Different mechanisms through which class size affects achievement are analyzed, in particular the interactive effect of class size and instructional practices. Four questions are posed: Is there a direct effect of class size on student achievement? Is this association mediated by instructional practices? Is there an interaction between class size and instruction? Is the effect of class size different for economically and academically disadvantaged students? The analysis is based on nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). The paper uses both hieararchical linear models of students within classes and teacher fixed effect regressions--to address the issue of unobserved heterogeneity among teachers. Contrary to the Project STAR? results, these findings do not present any evidence of direct effects and only few indirect effects of class size on reading and mathematic student achievement.

AB  - To investigate the effects of child-caregiver ratio on the quality of caregiver-child interaction in child-care centers, 217 caregivers (ages 18-56 years) from 64 child care centers were observed during two structured play episodes: one with a group of three children and one with a group of 5 children. As predicted, a child-caregiver ratio of 3:1 produced a significantly higher quality of caregiver-child interaction than a ratio of 5:1 and particularly for younger children. Significant and meaningful effects were found for both the interactive behaviors of the caregivers and the children's well-being and cooperation. Significant correlations with caregiver-child interaction during lunchtime and throughout the remainder of the morning confirmed the ecological validity of the caregiver-child interactions observed during structured play episodes.

AB  - Two experiments addressed the effects of play group composition (segregated or integrated), type of play materials (functional, constructive, or dramatic), and group size (2 or 4 children) on the amount and diversity of peer-directed language used by preschool children with disabilities during play. Twenty-four preschool children with disabilities, along with 12 peer playmates with disabilities and 12 typically developing playmates participated in each experiment. Dependent variables were rate of utterances, number of different words, and mean length of utterance transcribed from videotaped play sessions. Group composition and type of play materials had no significant effects. Group size had a significant multivariate effect on utterance rate and number of different words, with the children speaking more often when playing in dyads, but using more different words when playing in quartets.

AB  - The paper describes the Astor program for prekindergarten through primary age intellectually gifted children, and presents findings of a 5-year followup on the effect of the program on children's growth. Outlined are the program's major goals (including the promotion of continuing research, experimentation, and education of gifted in New York City public schools at all levels); activities (such as establishing early identification procedures and developing classroom management procedures consistent with the nature and needs of the students); impact on citywide politics; impact on district policies according to district superintendents; and impact on schools according to school principals. Also presented are the views of principals and parents regarding impact on the children. Noted among findings are that a significantly high proportion of parents reported positive behavioral reactions by their children to the Astor Program experience; that Astor Program children made significant achievement gains in world knowledge, total reading, and total mathematics; and that children not only liked school, but also were happier in the Astor Program than they had been in other classes. Also discussed are the following topics of concern: financing, pupil identification, pupil followup, promotion policies and acceleration, teacher selection, teacher training, class size, classroom practices and management, role of the school principal, and continued application of the Astor Program philosophy.

AB  - Attachment security with family child care providers was examined among 41 toddlers (age 12-19 months). Temporal stability of caregiver-child attachment security was assessed using the Attachment Q-Set, observing each dyad on two occasions, 1 to 2 weeks apart. Contextual correlates of child care provider attachment were also examined, including infant and family background characteristics, infant-provider interactive involvement, quality of the parent-provider relationship, provider characteristics and working conditions, and aspects of child care quality. Attachment Q-Set security and infant-provider interactive involvement were stable over time. Correlations and path analyses revealed that significant direct predictors of attachment security were the level of infant-provider interactive involvement, family socioeconomic status, and overall child care quality. Significant indirect predictors of attachment security (mediated through infant- provider interactive involvement) were child care group size, number of months with the provider, and age at entry into child care.

AB  - This study presents an evaluation of the effect of group size on the frequency with which young children ask questions. Subjects for the study were 32 preschool children (16 boys, 16 girls) ranging in age from 3.1 to 6.2 years. The children were divided into two non-overlapping age groups with mean ages of 3.6 and 5.2 years respectively. Each child participated in three experimental sessions during the same day: once alone, once with one same-sex peer and once with three same-sex peers. During each session, the children were given a set of three-dimensional objects (containing, for example, a fishing reel, desk sorter, lantern bottom, preserved frog in a bottle and a miniature metal chair and were invited to "take them out, play with them, and ask any questions about them if you like." The number of questions asked was obtained from videotapes of the sessions made in an adjoining screened observation booth. Results indicated that the frequency of questions asked per child was negatively related to group size, although two children as a group generated more questions than did children tested in groups of four or alone. Despite variations in group size and materials, the frequency of questions was correlated across sessions. No significant correlations were found between the number of questions asked and age or sex.

AB  - Studied cognitive and speech factors associated with speaking in dyadic or multi-speaker modes in 30 preschool and school-aged children (aged 3–5 yrs) in France. Ss were divided into groups of 3 age-matched male or female Ss each and videotaped during free interaction. At 1 wk, group size was increased to 4 members and at wk 2 to 5 members. The results were evaluated according to age, gender, group size, verbal and non-verbal communication, speaker, and listener(s), degree of engagement, interruptions, and word usage. The results show that cognitive management and conversational mechanisms are similar for triad, tetrad, and pentad interactions but that interactions involve all but one of the group members who is considered an outsider to the conversation. Multi-speaker conversations, 2-person and more than 2-person structures are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research Findings: The present study assessed the extent to which early childhood educators utilized small-group literacy instruction and explored factors potentially associated with the use of this evidence-based practice. The classroom activities of 83 early childhood educators were observed in the fall and spring, and videos were coded to calculate time spent in small-group literacy instruction. Educators completed questionnaires indicating classroom adult:child ratios, literacy beliefs, and feelings of self-efficacy. Classroom Assessment Scoring System scores for classroom organization and instructional support measured the quality of classroom management and instructional interactions, respectively. On average, educators provided 11.4 min (SD = 10.6) of small-group literacy instruction a day. It is notable that many educators provided little or no small-group literacy instruction. Negative binomial regression analyses indicated that educators with better classroom management, higher quality instructional interactions, and lower adult:child ratios were more likely to use small-group literacy instruction. Educators' beliefs and feelings of self-efficacy were not associated with the use of small-group literacy instruction. Practice or Policy: Educators may be better able to provide small-group literacy instruction in contexts affording low adult:child ratios and high levels of classroom management and instructional support, all of which are malleable factors that can be changed via policy or professional development.

AB  - This study draws from the National Center for Early Development and Learning's Multi-State Pre-Kindergarten Study to examine the extent to which program, classroom, and teacher attributes of the program ecology predict observed quality and teacher-child interactions in a sample of 238 classrooms representing 6 states' pre-kindergarten programs. Quality was assessed observationally at the global level and for specific teaching practices. Quality was lower in classrooms with more than 60% of the children from homes below the poverty line, when teachers lacked formal training (or a degree) in early childhood education, and held less child-centered beliefs. Program and teacher attributes were statistically significant, albeit quite modest, predictors of observed quality. Location of the program in a school building, child:staff ratio, and length of day had no relation to quality. State-level factors not attributable to the teacher, program, and classroom factors examined accounted for the majority of explained variance in observed quality. Results suggest that the association between distal features of programs and teachers and quality in pre-kindergarten is more similar to elementary school settings than to child care settings and that quality appears most closely related to proximal teacher and child characteristics.

AB  - The National Day Care Study investigated relationships between regulatable characteristics of daycare centers—in particular, staff/child ratios, group size, and staff qualifications—and the costs and quality of care experienced by preschool children, especially children from low-income families in federally subsidized care. The study found that the total number of children in a classroom was associated with several measures of the quality of the social environment and of children's development. In small groups, children were more cooperative, and were more likely to engage in spontaneous verbalization and creative/intellectual activities than when in large groups. They also made more rapid gains on standardized tests of cognitive and linguistic growth. Caregivers with education or training specifically related to young children showed a relatively high degree of social interaction with children, and children in their care made relatively rapid gains on standardized tests. The study concluded that the federal government could provide better care at lower cost by giving greater emphasis to group size and caregiver education/training in its purchasing standards.

AB  - 80 White middle-class 3–4 yr olds were observed in 4 daycare classrooms varying in teacher–child ratios (high and low) and physical layout (large, open spaces with special play areas in the corners or similar spaces partitioned into smaller special play areas). Several child and teacher behaviors were observed over 1 yr, including the incidence of M. B. Parten's (1932) play behaviors, peer interactions, and fantasy play in the presence or absence of teachers who did or did not disrupt the interactions. Several sex and group differences emerged, suggesting that the optimal classroom for facilitating peer interactions and fantasy play among middle-class preschool children is a classroom featuring a low teacher–child ratio and partitioned special play areas.

AB  - This research study, one in a series on day care, is based on the rationale that 2-year-old children, in play, are predominantly oriented toward solitary play and adults. Twelve subjects between 24 and 38 months of age, matched demographically on the Caldwell Pre-School Inventory and the Vineland Social Scales of Maturity were selected to test this hypothesis. Six of the subjects participated in an Individualized Instruction Program (I.I.P.) of play, and the remaining six belonged to a group play program. Pretest baseline data, midtest, and posttest data were obtained. Test results showed significantly better scores for the I.I.P. group on both the Caldwell Pre-School Inventory and the Vineland Social Scales of Maturity. Interactional data revealed more cooperative play among the I.I.P. subjects. Subsequent discussion indicated that the I.I.P. subjects were more successful due to the presence of the needed adult in their interaction with the environment. In addition, in group play a staff/student ratio of 1:3 produced a higher quality of verbal and social interaction than a ratio of 2:6. (SDH)

AB  - The impact of quality of child care at 6, 24, and 36 months on executive functioning at 54 months was the focus of this paper. The data was from the NICHD's Study of Early Child Care. In the current study quality of care included caregiver's background, the caregiver/child ratio, caregiver's depression, and global assessments of the quality of the environment. Executive functioning was conceptualized as child's performance on attention and impulse control tasks as well as maternal and caregiver report of these behaviors. It was hypothesized that quality of care over time would predict executive functioning even when controlling for other influencing factors. Additionally, later quality of care would be more predictive of executive functioning than earlier quality of care. Partial correlations and hierarchical regressions were used to test these hypotheses after the data were treated for missing variables as well as reduced into more appropriate and manageable components. Overall, 1364 children participated in the longitudinal study; however, 71 children attended a child care center at 6, 24, and 36 months and 174 children at 24 and 36 months. Quality of care was not significantly correlated with executive functioning for either group. However, caregiver depression was predictive of executive functioning for children who attended child care at all three time points. Additionally, quality of care at 36 months was a better predictor of executive functioning than at 24 months and the child/caregiver ratio at 24 months was a better predictor of executive than ratio at 36 or 6 months. These findings support the importance of quality child care as well as demonstrate that there is a relationship between early child care and later executive functioning.

AB  - Presents evidence supporting the position that good adult-child ratios are a necessary though not a sufficient condition for optimum child development. Poor ratios (greater than 1:7) limit development while high quality ratios (1:2 or 1:1) often result in outstanding development. Data indicate that ratio improvements within an environment result in improved development, and that outstanding development occurs only with ratios of 1:3 or less. Alternative models for providing low-ratio day care without excessive costs are discussed. (90 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 48 2-yr-olds were presented with 4 linguistic and 4 gestural stimuli by an experimenter; the child-to-caregiver ratio for the daycare sample was 10:1, for the homecare sample this ratio averaged 2:1. Analyses of Ss' imitative behaviors revealed that setting had a significant effect on these behaviors, with homecare Ss exhibiting more imitation, both linguistic and gestural, than the daycare Ss. Results are compared with recent imitation research, which suggests that imitation development is enhanced through 1-to-1 interaction with caregivers.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate regarding the importance of smaller classes in elementary school, and a lack of solid research to support class size policies in preschool. State spending on preschool has nearly doubled in the last five years and currently more than 80 percent of American 4-year olds go to some kind of preschool. Increasing enrollments in preschool coupled with the high costs of reducing the size of classes creates the need to decide how many children should be placed in a preschool classroom. The majority of states require that programs implement class sizes of 20 and teacher-child ratios of 1:10 (Barnett et al, 2011), but much of the research on class size suggests that class sizes smaller than 20 might be more beneficial for children. This dissertation examines the effects of preschool class size on classroom life and student achievement by drawing upon data from 21 teachers and 354 children that were collected during the 2008-2009 school year. Regular class sizes contained 20 students and reduced class sizes contained 15 students. Either the AM or PM session was randomly assigned to be 15 students for each teacher, so that each teacher taught both a regular and reduced class size. Children who attended reduced size classrooms were found to partake in more one-to-one interactions with teachers than children in regular size classrooms, but there were no differences between groups in the quality of classroom interactions as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). Children in smaller classrooms also were found to gain more in literacy skills by the end of preschool. In contrast, there were no significant differences between groups in vocabulary or math gains. These results indicate that an assigned difference of five children in a preschool classroom can benefit children's cognitive development after just one school year, but these benefits are not explained by changes in the most commonly used measures of classroom quality, which were minimal. Future endeavors to reduce class size in preschool might be enhanced if coupled with professional development strategies that aim to maximize teachers' effectiveness with smaller classes.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the quality of daycare by examining interactions between caregivers and young children. Across 49 Israeli daycare centers, 299 children aged 18-30 months were observed naturalistically in groups of four to eight, together with their main caregiver. Caregivers' behavior was defined in terms of mediation and was assessed using the Mediated Learning Experience Scale developed by Lidz. Mediated learning, a concept developed by Feuerstein, is a reciprocal process wherein an attentive adult sensitively uses didactic skills to mediate between a child and the world. It was hypothesized that caregivers' mediation behavior would be linked to children's affective responses. No correlation was found between mediation behavior and children's positive approaches to the caregiver. There was a tendency toward more crying episodes in daycare centers in which the caregiver mediated less. Two mediation subscales were created, one emphasizing cognitive elements of mediation and the other emotional elements. Episodes of crying were found to be significantly fewer in daycare centers in which caregivers' cognitive mediation skills were higher. Children were found to initiate fewer approaches to their main caregiver when other caregivers were present. A tendency was also found toward fewer approaches the larger the group size of the children, supporting previous findings on the importance of group size for quality of daycare.

AB  - Observed 6 autistic Ss (mean CA, 44.7 mo; mean MA, 24.3 mo) and 6 retarded Ss (mean CA, 56.2 mo; mean MA, 27.5 mo) for 7 20-min sessions. The following environmental parameters were manipulated: teacher-to-child ratio, presence of food reinforcement, and skill area being presented. Behavior under observation fell into 3 classes: adaptive performance (percentage response and percentage correct), attention, and maladaptive behavior. Results suggest that food reinforcement and the 1:1 teacher-to-child ratio may not generally enhance adaptive performance but may have an effect upon attention and tantrum behavior; attention to task is more predictive of adaptive behavior than attention to teacher; and interactions were generally lacking between the above parameters and diagnostic group, while level of functioning did show such interactions. Results support the practice of individual behavioral assessment of autistic and retarded children. The present procedure, coupled with statistical analysis for individual Ss, may provide educational prescriptions for individual children.

AB  - The ongoing Florida Child Care Quality Improvement Study investigates how Florida's new ratios and education requirements for early education and care affect children's development, parents' lives, and the early childhood marketplace. The project consists of three interrelated studies: The Children Study, The Parent Study, and The Market Study. The report summarizes the findings of all three studies in 1992 and 1994, and reports new findings from the 1996 Children Study. Among the findings noted are the following: (1) increased teacher education and ratio requirements significantly contributed to a number of positive outcomes in children's development in 1994 and continue to improve in 1996; (2) in comparison with other national multi-site studies of the overall quality of early education and care, Florida has made positive strides; (3) increased staff education and more rigorous ratio requirements did not have a marked negative impact on the child care marketplace nor did requirements significantly affect consumer costs during the 1992-96 period; (4) The greatest gains in children's development and in the quality of the early childhood education and care occurred when classrooms met professionally recommended ratios, which are higher than the new Florida ratios; and (5) teachers with an advanced education (associate's degree or higher) had the highest scores in terms of children's development and classroom quality; however, in 1996, teachers with a CDA or equivalency were warmer and more sensitive as well as more responsive with children than those with less than a CDA.

AB  - Rates and predictors of preschool expulsion and suspension were examined in a randomly selected sample of Massachusetts preschool teachers (N = 119). During a 12-month period, 39% of teachers reported expelling at least one child, and 15% reported suspending. The preschool expulsion rate was 27.42 per 1000 enrollees, more than 34 times the Massachusetts K-12 rate and more than 13 times the national K-12 rate. Suspension rates for preschoolers; were less than that for K-12. Larger classes, higher proportion of 3-year-olds in the class, and elevated teacher job stress predicted increased likelihood of expulsion. Location in a school or Head Start and teachers' positive feelings of job satisfaction predicted decreased likelihood of expulsion. Expulsion was relatively rare in classes where both class size and teacher job stress were low. A higher proportion of Latino children in the class and lower teacher job satisfaction predicted an increased likelihood of suspension. Implications are discussed regarding policy, prevention, and future research.

AB  - This study examined the concept of quality in child day care and how this can be measured by the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS). Swedish day care centers in three communities were administered a version of the ECERS, which was translated from the original scale to accommodate conceptual differences between Sweden and the United States. Before the ECERS was used, a statistical analysis of the scale showed that some items were highly intercorrelated or had low variability, and these items were combined into one or excluded, thus reducing the 37 original items to 28. Raters demonstrated an average interrater agreement of 83 percent in a study of 40 day care centers in Goteborg, due to the intensive training in how to use the ECERS in a Swedish day care context. Results of using ECERS in the three target communities showed that, compared to other countries, the physical standard of child care in Sweden is high. On the basis of the high cost of child care, the high staff to child ratio, and the high proportions of trained personnel in Swedish day care centers, it is assumed that there also is a high and even quality. By using the ECERS as a measure for pedagogical quality in day care, however, results of studies in the three investigated communities revealed considerable variation in quality. Variation was found in the overall quality between the three communities and within the different aspects of quality in each community. (DR)

AB  - This paper evaluates the methodology and conclusions of the Cost, Quality and Child Outcomes Study, the largest and most utilized study of child care in the United States. The outcomes study specifically investigated the link between the cost and quality of childcare programs and child development. Data was collected from site visits to approximately 400 childcare centers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, and North Carolina. The findings indicated that the quality of childcare is poor to mediocre in most centers and that cognitive and social development is affected by the quality of childcare received. Quality of care was related to staff-child ratios, staff education and administrators' experience, teacher compensation, teacher education, and licensing standards. The study concluded that good quality childcare costs slightly more than mediocre care. However, a review of the sample design and response rates, cost measures, quality measures, and analytic issues used in the study indicates that the estimations of the cost and quality of centers should have been calculated by classroom rather than the entire center to reflect differentials between infant/toddler classes and preschool classes. For example, the average annual cost for a child in the infant/toddler classroom is 50 percent higher than the cost for a child in a preschool classroom. Quality also is lower in infant/toddler classrooms than preschool classrooms, a difference that can be attributed to the typical backgrounds of teachers at each level. Although teachers in infant/toddler classrooms tend to have less education and experience than teachers in preschool classes, the original conclusions overlook the finding that the relationship between wage levels and quality is significant only for teachers with the least education. Differences in wages had no effect on the quality of the classroom when the teacher had a college degree. The critique also suggests that comparisons between the high quality centers and low quality centers should have included medium quality centers to further analyze the impact of cost. The authors conclude that most of the findings cited in the Cost, Quality and Child Outcomes study do not accurately reflect the results of the analyses. The conclusions should have been more specific to the classroom level and described the expected impact of recommended expenditures. Problems with selection bias, low response rates, and the attrition of participants should limit the application of the results. 4 references, 3 tables.

AB  - This paper reports on the design, methodology, and results of a study of quality in 326 classrooms in 239 Canadian child care centers. This study, the largest and most extensive ever undertaken in Canada, used the Caregiver Interaction Scale (CIS) to rate the adult-child interactions in the classrooms and the Infant-Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS) and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised (ECERS-R) to measure the quality of classroom learning environments. The observed staff members completed questionnaires on wages, working conditions, and satisfaction levels, and the center directors also completed questionnaires on center operations and finances. Path analyses revealed that in the infant/toddler rooms the number of adults in the observed classroom and the education level of the observed staff member were direct predictors of quality. In addition, there were three indirect predictors: parent fees, adult:child ratio, and use of the center as a student teacher practicum site. There were five significant direct predictors in the preschool classrooms: wages, education level, number of staff in the observed room, staff satisfaction, and whether the center received free or subsidized rent or utilities. The three indirect predictors were auspice, adult:child ratio, and parent fees. The interaction of distal and proximal factors is interpreted and applied to the development and implementation of public policy initiatives that can provide much-needed improvement to the overall mediocre levels of child care quality in Canada.

AB  - Discussed in this ERIC Digest are the quality of infant day care and aspects of the debate on infant attachment. Characteristics of current infant day care provisions are reported. Program quality is discussed in terms of: (1) structural features, such as group size, staff-child ratios, caregiver training, equipment, space; (2) dynamic aspects, including experiences and interactions; and (3) contextual features, notably staff stability and turnover, and type of setting. A section on effects of infant care points out that while several studies show that day care may benefit low-income children and have benign, if not beneficial, effects on middle-class children, research findings on socioemotional development are not unanimous. The concluding section discusses attachment in terms of the controversy about day care for infants under 1 year of age and studies comparing home versus employed mothers. (RH)

AB  - Objective: To investigate the association between the child-care environment and physical activity of 2- and 3-year-olds. Based on an ecological view of environmental influences on health behavior, we hypothesized that the social and physical environment, as well as child characteristics (age and gender), would show independent and interactive effects on children's physical activity intensity. Design: Observations of physical activity intensity were performed among children (N = 175) at 9 Dutch child-care centers. Aspects of the child-care environment were assessed using the validated Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) Instrument. Multilevel linear regression analyses examined the association of environment and child characteristics with children's activity intensity. Moderation was tested by including interaction terms in the analyses, with subsequent post hoc analyses for significant interaction terms. Main Outcome Measure: Observed child physical activity intensity, measured with the Observational System for Recording Physical Activity in Children - Preschool Version. Results: A large proportion of the observed activities were classified as sedentary, while far fewer observations were classified as moderate or vigorous. Activity opportunities in the physical environment (assessed using EPAO) and prompts by staff and peers were significantly and positively related to physical activity intensity, while group size was negatively related to activity intensity. The influence of the physical environment was moderated by social environment (peer group size), while the social environment in turn interacted with child characteristics (age and gender) in determining activity intensity. Conclusion: Our findings are in line with the ecological perspective regarding environmental influences on behavior, and stress the importance of incorporating the child-care environment in efforts to prevent childhood overweight and obesity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the role of individual differences in children's effortful control in the relation between quality of the child care experience and social adjustment, behavior problems and negative emotionality of preschool children. Within the scope of this study there were two composite measures of quality; quality problems and adult involvement. Quality problems reflecting chaos in child care classrooms as well as poor global quality were positively associated with behavior problems of children. Adult involvement measure reflected children-staff ratio and positive teacher-child interaction. In line with the previous research findings, effortful control was positively associated with social adjustment and it was negatively associated with behavioral problems. Effortful control was not related to the composite measures of quality. Positive teacher-child interaction was negatively related to the effortful control of the children. In testing the mediational hypothesis, both causal steps and bootstrapping approaches were used. Effortful control was a partial mediator in linking positive teacher-child interaction to social adjustment. The bootstrapping approach supported the significant indirect effects of positive teacher-child interaction on social adjustment and behavior problems through effortful control of children as well. The interaction between negative emotionality and effortful control in predicting social adjustment was also examined within the scope of this study. Teacher ratings of negative emotionality and effortful control were both predictors of social adjustment and behavior problems but the relationship between effortful control and social adjustment did not change as a function of the level of negative emotionality. In this study the child-staff ratio and positive teacher-child interaction were among the most important aspects of the child care experience that needed to be taken into account in linking child care, child temperament, and behavioral outcomes.

AB  - This exploratory study examined the influences of student, teacher, and setting characteristics on kindergarteners’ early reading outcomes and investigated whether those relations were moderated by type of intervention. Participants included 206 kindergarteners identified as at risk for reading difficulties and randomly assigned to one of two supplemental interventions: (a) an experimental explicit, systematic, code-based program or (b) their schools’ typical kindergarten reading intervention. Results from separate multilevel structural equation models indicated that among student variables, entry-level alphabet knowledge was positively associated with phonemic and decoding outcomes in both conditions. Entry-level rapid automatized naming also positively influenced decoding outcomes in both conditions. However, its effect on phonemic outcomes was statistically significant only among children in the typical practice comparison condition. Regarding teacher variables, the quality of instruction was associated with significantly higher decoding outcomes in the typical reading intervention condition but had no statistically significant influence on phonemic outcomes in either condition. Among setting variables, instruction in smaller group sizes was associated with better phonemic outcomes in the comparison condition but had no statistically significant influence on outcomes of children in the intervention group. Mode of delivery (i.e., pullout vs. in class) had no statistically significant influence on either outcome variable.

AB  - This longitudinal study examined the relationship of care quality in children's homes and external day care settings to children's emotional expressions and to problem and competence behaviors. Subjects were 123 children (63 males, 60 females) mostly from middle-class Swedish families. When children were 29 months old, data about quality of care and child emotional expressions were collected in the home and day care environments. The care quality observational protocol and a supplementing interview with the mother and the external caregiver were based on the HOME instrument. When children were 4 years old, maternal, paternal, and child group leaders' ratings of externalized and internalized behavior problems were obtained in the Behar and Stringfield Preschool Behavior Questionnaire. Results showed that externalizing behaviors were related to home quality; internalizing behaviors and positive behaviors were related to quality in both settings. In general, high quality contributed to fewer problems and more positive behaviors. A low level of stimulation in the home and a high child-to-adult ratio in external care were related to more peer competence. (MM)

AB  - Recent research and teacher reports have highlighted the importance of early behavior skills for children’s school readiness and academic success in elementary school. Significant school readiness and achievement gaps exist between children in poverty and those who are more affluent. Children living in poverty are also more likely to exhibit behavior concerns than their more financially advantaged peers. Helping low-income children improve their behavior skills prior to school entry may be one strategy to help them be more ready for school and more successful once there. The current study examined the importance of behavioral skills at age four for school readiness and academic achievement in elementary school among an ethnically-diverse sample of 2,258 low-income children (62% Latino, 35% Black, 3% White/other) attending center-based child care. Associations between different child care characteristics (teacher-child interactions, child-adult ratio, teacher education, observed quality) and children’s behavior problems were also investigated. Analyses revealed that children’s behavior problems at age four helped predict children’s school readiness and school outcome, even above and beyond cognitive and language skills at age four, providing support for targeting behavior problems prior to school entry as a strategy to help increase the likelihood of low-income children’s school readiness and success. Attending a child care center with a staff:child ratio of 1:8 or lower was associated with lower behavior problems at the end of the child care year, just prior to entering kindergarten. Implications for practitioners and funding agencies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined the classroom behavior of children with disabilities in both social and mastery domains. Also, the relations among child characteristics, classroom characteristics, and children's behaviors were examined. 153 children (mean age 40.4 mo) with disabilities (49 with Down syndrome, 57 with motor impairment, and 47 with developmental delays) were observed in a total of 148 preschool classrooms. Social interaction with peers and teachers, strategies employed in attempts to master tasks, and use of time in the classroom were recorded by trained blind observers using a modified time sampling procedure. Analyses indicated significant relations between Ss' classroom behavior and 3 selected classroom characteristics: degree of integration, teacher–child ratio, and the extent to which Ss could choose activities. Ss with higher levels of cognitive performance displayed more advanced levels of social interaction and mastery task involvement. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Noting that the kindergarten year is important in establishing competencies critical to children's success and achievement in school, and the lack of information on how children make the transition to kindergarten, this study examined differences in parental reports of children's adjustment behaviors for a large, nationally representative sample of beginning public school kindergartners. The focus of the research was on the prevalence of parent-reported adjustment problems of first-time public school kindergartners and whether some groups of children experience these adjustment problems more than others. The adjustment behaviors examined were: complaining about going to school, being upset or reluctant to go to school, and pretending to be sick to stay home from school. Data were from a subset of 13,602 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K). Parents reported that 72 percent of first-time public school kindergartners did not show signs of adjustment difficulty during the first 2 months of the school year. Thirteen percent showed one adjustment difficulty, and 15 percent exhibited two or more. Certain child, family, and kindergarten program characteristics were related to the percent of children who showed adjustment difficulties. Being male, having a disability, or living in a lower socioeconomic status family were associated with adjustment difficulties. Children attending full-day kindergarten programs and those in class sizes of 25 or more children were more likely to demonstrate adjustment difficulties even after controlling for other child and family characteristic differences.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that mind-mindedness is an important element of caregiver-child interactions in family and childcare context. This study investigated caregivers' mind-mindedness in a nationally representative Dutch sample and its relation with structural quality factors (i.e., group size, caregivers' education and work experience, group type, and situation) and caregivers' interactive skills. Participants were 99 caregivers recruited in 50 childcare centers. Mind-mindedness was assessed with observations during free-play and lunch situations in infant, preschool, and mixed-age groups (0-4-year-olds). Caregivers' appropriate and nonattuned mind-related comments were coded as individual (over/toward one child) or group related (over or toward more than one child). Caregivers' interactive skills were assessed using the Caregiver Interaction Profile (CIP) scales. Research Findings: Caregivers generally refer to children's desires, thoughts, and emotions in about 10% of their verbal interactions, with a low incidence rate of nonattuned comments (< 1%). Mind-mindedness was found to be significantly associated with structural quality characteristics and caregivers' interactive skills. Caregivers with greater interactive skills produced fewer individual and more group appropriate mind-minded comments in mixed-age groups. Practice or Policy: We discuss the relevance of mind-minded comments at individual and group level for the future study of mental-state talk in early childhood education and care.

AB  - Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) include the assessment of classroom quality as one component of how early childhood programs are monitored and licensed in many states across the United States. However, varying measures and foci of quality exist and have led to challenges in accurately depicting program quality across programs and improvement efforts. The current validation study explores several measures of classroom quality and their associations with components and overall star ratings of the North Carolina QRIS and preschool children's social-emotional outcomes within center-based child care programs. Data for this study were collected in 2009, 10 years after the start of North Carolina's QRIS. Results indicate that individual levels of star ratings did not generally represent distinctive levels of classroom quality, but did differentiate classrooms at the lower and higher levels of quality. Structural features of the environments such as teacher education and teacher–child ratio were associated with classroom quality across these measures in the expected directions; however, teacher experience was not. Further, children's social-emotional outcomes were predicted to a varying degree by star levels and different aspects of classroom quality as represented by these various measures. Results are discussed in terms of the differing levels of quality and teaching processes in classrooms. Future directions for research are presented to contribute to an increased understanding of QRIS and children’ experiences in early care and education programs.

AB  - In this study, we investigated children's classroom engagement and disaffection and their relationships with class size, child gender, child age and school type in Vietnamese kindergartens. Children's classroom engagement and disaffection were examined among 1315 kindergarteners (mean age = 5.49; SD = 0.87) and 33 teachers from 31 classrooms in 8 kindergartens. The results of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that children's classroom engagement and disaffection included four dimensions: behavioural engagement, emotional engagement, behavioural disaffection and emotional disaffection. The results also showed that both behavioural and emotional dimensions of classroom engagement were higher than those of disaffection. Girls had higher emotional and behavioural classroom engagement and lower emotional disaffection than boys. Class size had a negative relationship with both dimensions of children's disaffection. The findings also indicated that children in the older age group showed greater emotional disaffection and lower emotional engagement compared to children in the younger age group.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the difference between class size on student literacy achievement utilizing district-wide kindergarten student theme assessment scores at the end of first, second, and third trimester. Student achievement was measured by the district's theme assessment scores on four areas of literacy skills. The specific literacy skills examined in this study included (1) uppercase letter identification, (2) lowercase letter identification, (3) high-frequency word identification, and (4) rhyming skills. Teacher perceptions were also explored though the use of teacher surveys and interviews to determine how teachers perceived the increase in class size and its effect on their instructional practices, student-teacher interaction, and teaching behavior with their classroom. This study revealed statistically significant differences in student achievement and class size. The study's quantitative and qualitative data found that students who were taught during class size increase performed just as well, if not better, on literacy theme assessments than students who were taught during class size reduction. The study's data, however, found that when class sizes increased other important aspects of instruction were greatly impacted. The findings of this study also indicated that there was a strong need for reduced class size to increase teachers' job satisfaction and performance. The quantitative data were represented in a comparison study with the use of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

Indicators of daycare quality included quality of interaction with teachers, arrangement of the physical space, spaciousness of the environment, appropriateness and variety of the materials provided for play, quality of the outdoor area, group size, and child–teacher ratio. Relationships were found between these dimensions and Ss' absorption in solitary play and knowledge of social problem solving. Most relationships held up after the effects of social class were statistically removed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

Found that caregiver reading was quite brief for all ages and that caregivers found it easier to read to female than to male infants. Findings suggest the need for reading courses designed for infant caregivers. (JPB)

Cross tabulations were used to explore relationships between child behaviors and language use, type of activity, group size, and adult role. Results show that Ss spent most of their day in small or large groups with 1 adult either observing or directing an activity. Usually Ss were positively involved in tasks and engaged in far more receptive than expressive language. Activity, group size, and teacher role influenced the types and frequencies of the behaviors observed. (9 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Peer social behaviors and interaction were observed in day care centers and family day care homes in order to examine the influences of experience and environment. The naturally occurring behaviors of forty toddlers and their peers were time sampled in day care settings. Day care facilities were community based and varied in group size, age composition, and the number and type of play objects. Experience with preschoolers as siblings or playmates and aspects of the inanimate environment in different day care settings influenced peer behavior. Small, mixed age groups in family day care facilitated talking. Center toddlers with older siblings engaged in more prosocial behaviors. Peer play was more complex when using nonportable objects in day care centers and space relationships in family day care. (Author/RH)

AB  - Toddler-age children's (11 to 30 months old) play with care-giving adults and with toys and peers was observed and rated in family day-care homes. Fifty-five children, their mothers, and family day-care home providers participated in this study. The quality of the family day-care homes was assessed with the Harms and Clifford Family Day Care Rating Scale (FDCRS) and by measures of ratio and group size. Information on family stress, social support, child-rearing attitudes, and maternal role satisfaction was reported by mothers. More nurturing and supported families were associated with higher quality child care, whereas more restrictive and stressed families were associated with lower quality child care. More restrictive and stressed families were associated with more changes in child-care arrangements. Greater numbers of child-care changes also were associated with lower levels of competent play with objects and peers. When quality of care was controlled, both more nurturing and supported families and less restrictive and stressed families were associated with higher levels of competent play with adult caregivers, peers, and objects. When family characteristics were controlled, higher quality child care was associated with more competent play with adult caregivers and with peers and objects.

AB  - We assessed the quality of center child care relationships with adults and peers for 414 children (ages 14 to 54 months). Classrooms were classified by ratio and group size provisions of the Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements (FIDCR) and by the Early Childhood and Infant and Toddler Environmental Rating Scales. Children cared for in classrooms meeting FIDCR ratios were more likely to be in classrooms rated as good or very good in caregiving and activities. Children in classrooms rated as good or very good in caregiving were more likely to be securely attached to teachers. Securely attached children were more competent with peers. Children cared for in classrooms meeting FIDCR group size were more likely to be in classrooms rated higher in activities. Children in classrooms rated high in activities were likely to orient to both adults and peers. Children with social orientations to adults and peers were more competent with peers.

AB  - An ongoing child care improvement study is being conducted of approximately 150 licensed child care providers in 4 Florida counties. The study is assessing the impact of state legislation, which mandated lower caregiver-to-child ratios and increased credentialing. Thus far, the study has found the following effects: (1) children's emotional and intellectual development is improving; (2) teachers are more responsive and receptive since the increase in ratios; (3) negative management styles have become less frequently used; (4) global quality improved significantly from 1992-1994; (5) the number of children in child care has remained constant, but the number of staff has increased slightly; (6) teachers' salaries and parent fees have increased slightly; and (7) teacher turnover increased slightly. (Includes 15 tables, some of which are appended; and contains 46 references.) (JW)

AB  - The relation between teacher background and adult:child ratio in center-based child care was examined in two representative samples: the Cost, quality, and Outcome Study (N = 655 classrooms and 760 children) and the Florida Quality Improvement Study (N = 410 classrooms and 820 children). Classrooms were classified according to whether the observed adult:child ratio met professional standards and by the background (formal education and early childhood education training) of the lead teacher. We compared children and teacher behaviors based on these classifications. In both samples, teacher background made an independent contribution, distinguishing between teaching behaviors, children's activities, and outcomes. Teachers with the most advanced education were most effective. Teachers with associate of arts degrees and CDA certificates were more effective than teachers with some college or just high school plus workshops. In the Cost, Quality, and Outcome study, but not the Florida Quality Improvement Study, classrooms that complied with professional standards also had teachers with more effective teaching and more positive child outcomes. There were no interactive effects of ratio and teacher background.

This article was published with typing errors to Table 2 and Table 4. The correct tables for this article are reprinted in the Erratum.] We examined children's growth in school-related learning and social skills over the pre-Kindergarten (pre-K) year in state-funded programs designed to prepare children for kindergarten. We expected that children's gains in academic and social skills could be attributed to variations in the structural and classroom process dimensions of program quality. Nearly 3000 (n = 2800) children were randomly selected, four per classroom, from approximately 700 randomly selected, state-funded pre-Kindergarten classrooms in eleven states. Enrollment in pre-K appeared related to gains in academic skills. Children showed larger gains in academic outcomes when they experienced higher-quality instruction or closer teacher-child relationships. Gains were not related to characteristics of the child or program (i.e., ratio, teacher qualifications and program location and length). These findings have implications for a range of state and local policy and program development efforts as well as for theories of contextual influences on development.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between structural variables and program quality in early childhood programs across economic, sociocultural, and policy contexts in Zhejiang, China. Using the Chinese Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (CECERS), researchers collected data in 162 randomly selected classrooms representative of the sociocultural and economic conditions of Chinese early childhood programs. The findings showed that a set of program structural variables accounted for 60% of the variance in overall program quality. Similar findings were shown for two specific program quality indicators: structural quality (‘Provisions for Learning’) and process quality (‘Teaching & Interaction’). Results suggest that policy makers in early childhood education in China should offer more benefits and training for teachers, recognize teachers' professional qualifications, and maintain lower child-to-teacher ratio to improve Chinese ECE programs.

AB  - In this study, the generalized additive modeling (GAM) was used to explore possible threshold effects on multiple program structure quality indicators (class size, child-to-teacher ratio, teaching experience, teacher salary) in relation to the classroom teacher-child interaction quality indicators as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) in a sample of Chinese kindergarten classrooms. One hundred eighty classrooms in 60 preschools were selected for the study, based on a stratified sampling procedure. The results were mixed, and revealed threshold effects on some structural indicators. The findings are discussed in the context of Chinese early childhood education practice. As the first study of its kind in a Chinese context, the findings could have some implications for early childhood education policy and practice despite some limitations of the study. Future research may consider better design and more representative sample for studying these issues.

AB  - The Illinois Prekindergarten Program for Children at Risk of Academic Failure was a grant program for public school districts to enhance growth and development of children ages 3 to 5 who are at risk of academic failure. The program has experienced significant growth since its initial implementation, and the number of participating projects increased 13 percent compared to FY 92. This report presents a review and evaluation of the Illinois Prekindergarten At-Risk Program for the 1992-1993 school year. The evaluation ranked children's academic performance in reading, mathematics, language, and behavior. The report describes child characteristics according to each child's ethnicity, family structure, health, primary language, free-lunch status, and any previous preschool experiences. In addition, the projects' characteristics are described in terms of eligibility requirements, instructional settings, educational staff, teacher-child ratio, collaboration with other programs and agencies, and parent participation and involvement. Findings suggest that the program has had a positive influence on students' kindergarten readiness and that performance levels have been sustained in the early elementary grades. Based on the evaluation results, recommendations include: (1) the state should continue to expand the program to include all at-risk children; (2) the at-risk program should continue to emphasize the role of parents; and (3) the state should increase funding to make services available to more children. Four appendices contain the State Board of Education policy statement on early childhood education, the School Code of Illinois, data tables and figures on scores and funds, four references, and a map of Illinois showing the number of projects and number of children served in each county in FY93.

AB  - Research Findings: Early child care policy and practice are grounded in a growing understanding of the importance of the first years of life. In earlier studies, associations between child-staff ratios and peer skills yielded inconsistent findings. The current study used data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N=1,364) to test the existence of curvilinear associations between child-staff ratios and observed peer skills at the ages of 3 and 4.5years in order to derive optimal ratios featuring higher levels of peer skills. The findings indicated curvilinear associations between child-staff ratio during the first 3 and 4.5years and the frequency of positive and negative peer interactionsespecially positive peer interactions. Furthermore, these curvilinear associations characterized positive play with a friend at 4.5years. Optimal child-staff ratios featuring higher levels of peer skills were somewhat lower for positive play with a friend than for the frequency of positive peer interactions. Practice or Policy: Curvilinear associations that point to an optimal value of child-staff ratio may be used to validate child care standards. Optimal child-staff ratios found in the current study coincided with recommended early care standards.

AB  - This report for the 1982-83 school year summarizes the results of Project Primetime, an experimental program to improve students' basic skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic by reducing class size from kindergarten through the second grade. Three major results emerged from the study: (1) Students in the project scored higher on standardized tests than did students in larger classes; (2) Discipline and behavior problems were reduced in classes with lower teacher/student ratios; and (3) Teachers reported increased productivity and effectiveness in classes with fewer students. It was concluded that small class size during the early years of a child's academic development strongly enhances the quality of the child's initial educational experiences. Appendices list the nine schools participating in Project Primetime during 1981-82 and 1982-83 and enumerate the 24 school corporations and 28 school sites participating in the program during the 1983-84 and 1984-85 school years.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine associations between the automated Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) system adult word count (AWC) variable and characteristics of classrooms (e.g., teacher burnout) and preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (e.g., autism severity). The AWC samples from 67 preschoolers with ASD were collected during typical morning classroom routines (e.g., center time). Results indicated that AWC was positively associated with children’s cognitive ability and negatively associated teacher burnout and adult to student with ASD ratio. Lower adult to children with ASD ratio (i.e., fewer adults relative to students with ASD) resulted in preschoolers receiving less adult language. Additional factors thought to be related to child and classroom characteristics affecting the adult language directed at children with ASD are discussed.

AB  - A study investigated the effect of kindergarten class size on reading readiness achievement. Subjects, 2,837 kindergarten students in 38 elementary schools that serve rural, urban, suburban, and inner-city schools, participated in the first year of Project STAR (Student Teacher Academic Ratio) in 1985-86. The subjects' 140 kindergarten teachers reported data indicating mastery or non-mastery of the 25 reading readiness objectives of the Tennessee Basic Skills First program. Data were analyzed using a five-way analysis of variance and a crosstabulation procedure with a chi-square test of significance. Results indicated that: (1) small class size is significantly related to reading achievement in the total 25 tested Basic Skills and the subcategory of 20 comprehension skills; (2) the 1:15 class mastered one more objective than the 1:25 class and 0.6 more of an objective than the 1:25 plus a full-time aide class; (3) no significant relationship was found between classes of 1:15, 1:25, or 1:25 plus a full-time aide and the mastery of the five word identification skills; (4) the 1:25 class was found to be least effective in achieving reading readiness; (5) students in classes of 1:15 who attended 90 percent of the time showed the greatest gain; and (6) the lowest mean scores were received by males, blacks, free/reduced lunch, and inner city students in the 1:25 class, and the highest scores for this group were in the 1:15 class. Recommendations include mandatory kindergarten with a teacher/pupil ration of 1:15. (Twenty-three tables and 58 figures of data are included; 95 references, House Bill No. 544, the Tested Basic Skills Individual and Group Records, and 25 tables of data are attached.) (RS)

AB  - This kindergarten through grade 2 program, intended to prevent the development of educational deficits, proposed to utilize the main features of the More Effective Schools and the All Day Neighborhood Schools programs in order to (1) increase the academic level of children in poverty areas, (2) involve the parents in that primary objective, and (3) provide liaison with other grades in school. Class size was reduced to 15 pupils for kindergarten and first grade, and to 20 for the second grade. The five special primary schools served a total of 2,336 children, 99 percent of whom were Negro, and one percent Puerto Rican. No systematic quantitative differences were found between performance in these schools and the several baseline comparison schools. However, the improved qualitative benefits resulting from reduced class size suggest definite advantages potentially accruing to the facilities of the Special Primary Program. Sample questionnaire and interview forms used in the evaluation are appended. (EM)

AB  - This study examined relations among children's individual experiences, global classroom quality, and school readiness. Preschool children from low-income backgrounds (N = 138; M = 62.16 months; SD = 3.93; range = 55-70) were observed in their early care and education settings, and their language and cognitive skills were assessed. Research Findings: Individual children in classrooms with small group sizes had higher quality individual experiences even though global classroom quality was not necessarily better. Higher levels of global classroom quality did not ensure that every child in the classroom was engaged fully in available interactions and activities. Children with disabilities were generally enrolled in classrooms with higher global quality and had higher quality individual experiences than those without disabilities; however, children without disabilities enrolled in these inclusive classrooms did not necessarily have a higher level of individual experiences than those in non-inclusive classrooms. Children's individual experiences and the global quality of their classrooms were associated with their social skills. Only the quality of children's individual experiences was found to be related to the quality of their relationships with teachers. Practice or Policy: Ratings of children's individual experiences provide information beyond that provided by global ratings of classroom quality and have potential for informing efforts to individualize educational programs.

AB  - The study assessed the nature of teacher-child interactions in early childhood classrooms in India, from the teachers' and parents' perspectives. Specifically, the impact of teacher training, satisfaction with training and job, years of experience, and class size on the teacher-child interactions were examined. Sixty-five preschool teachers and 173 parents from an urban city in India comprised the total sample. Results using teacher reports indicated that the findings were not significant. According to parent reports, 25% of variance was accounted. Amount of experience showed a trend towards significance. Satisfaction with training of teachers inversely impacted the nature of teacher-child interactions. These findings suggested the interplay of specific factors such as limited space, finances and cultural notions of teaching/education, and adult-child relations on the perceptions of early childhood teachers and parents on teacher-child interactions in an Indian Context.

AB  - This document summarizes a full report that sought to improve understanding of achievement gaps in the early elementary grades, the adequacy of preschool education currently given, and the efficiencies or additional resources that might be brought to bear in early care and education. This study ascertains the percentage of children who participate in ECE programs at ages three and four; the quality of the programs in which they participate; and how access and quality varies for children of different racial or ethnic backgrounds or from low- and high-income families. The analysis suggests that program features, such as teacher education and child-adult ratios, can provide a gauge for identifying those classrooms that would score higher on the quality aspects captured in the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, revised edition (ECERS-R) or the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) scales, but it does not provide a very strong signal for these key dimensions of quality.

AB  - This study compared Swedish and British child care policy, educational philosophy, and function and organization of preschools. The activities, language, and group patterns of 559 children in 73 full-time and 42 part-time preschools in Sweden were observed. Questionnaires assessed staff-child ratio, group size, staff working conditions, and demographics in preschools. in the British study, 120 children were observed in 3 types of preschools. Results indicated that adult-led and cognitive activities were more common in Swedish than in British preschools, and that gross motor play was more common in British than in Swedish preschools. Despite differences in staff-child ratio and group sizes, the frequency of dialogue between children and adults was similar in Swedish and British preschools. It is observed that unlike British preschools, Swedish preschools are an important part of the total family welfare system. At present, the function of British preschools is educational, in contrast to Swedish preschools where both child care and education are the goals. However, both countries' educational philosophies emphasizes play and self-initiated activity. It is concluded that national child care policy directly affects educational practices in preschools and indirectly affects children's learning and development. A list of 12 references is included.

AB  - THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING OF PROFESSIONAL AND LAY PEOPLE REGARDING CHILDREN'S PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS. THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF THE STUDY RELATED TO THIS PURPOSE WERE--(1) THE ANALYSIS OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND READING GROWTH, (2) THE COMPARISON OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SIBLINGS AND UNRELATED CHILDREN, AND (3) A COMPARISON OF THE FERNDALE DATA AND DATA COLLECTED AT THE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL IN ANN ARBOR. THE MAJOR PORTION OF THE DATA WAS DRAWN FROM RECORDS OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THE CITY OF FERNDALE, MICHIGAN. SIX YEARS AGO, THIS SCHOOL DISTRICT BEGAN A LONGITUDINAL TESTING PROGRAM OF CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN THROUGH EIGHTH GRADE WHO WERE MEASURED TWICE YEARLY FOR PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND ACADEMIC GROWTH WITH ALL MEASUREMENTS CONVERTED INTO AGE UNITS. RECORDS WERE AVAILABLE ON 2,920 CHILDREN IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES. IN ADDITION TO TESTING THEORETICAL CONCEPTS OF DEVELOPMENT, STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF THE DATA PERMITTED CONTRASTS OF PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO SUCH FACTORS AS SEX, RACE, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, CLASS SIZE, AND INSTRUCTIONAL GROUPING. THE FINDINGS OF THE FERNDALE PROJECT SUGGEST THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS AND TEACHERS IS THAT OF LEARNING HOW TO BETTER COPE WITH THE LARGE AND DYNAMIC VARIABILITY IN GROWTH STATUS, GROWTH RATE, AND GROWTH PATTERN WHICH IS CHARACTERISTIC OF GROWING CHILDREN.

AB  - Studied the effect of class size on children's social interaction with peers and teachers. Ss were 70 preschoolers and 7 teachers in 3 classes of 40 students, 3 classes of 30 students, and 1 class of 20 students in Korean schools. Early in a semester and at the end of the semester, sociometric interviews were done to identify peer relationships. Children's play behaviors and teachers' behaviors were observed. Results showed that teachers' behaviors did not significantly differ when their education and training backgrounds were similar. However, children in various sized classes showed differences in their relationship formations and play behaviors with peers across the semester. This study concludes that class size affects children's peer networks, and the differences in play behavior may be related to the differences in peer relationships.

AB  - This study examined the role of a supportive classroom climate, class size, and length of teaching experience as protective factors against children's peer rejection. A total of 376 children were assessed in kindergarten for risk for reading disabilities (RD) and rated by their teachers on socially withdrawn and disruptive behaviors. The grade 1 measures included sociometric peer assessment and teachers' self-ratings of their supportiveness in the classroom, together with information on class size and teaching experience. The results showed, first, that the studied social and learning risk factors positively predicted peer rejection in grade 1. Moreover, teacher-reported supportive classroom climate in grade 1 protected children against the detrimental impact of RD risk on peer rejection. Smaller class size, in turn, served as a protective factor against the detrimental impact of social withdrawal on peer rejection. Finally, shorter teaching experience protected against both social and learning risk factors. (Contains 1 table and 2 figures.)

AB  - The present study examined the benefits of early childhood education on children's acquisition of early literacy skills. The study utilized data from students in a small, central Pennsylvania school district at the beginning and end of kindergarten on measures of early literacy skills. Along with early literacy skills, the study also examined the home literacy environments of the students and the quality of the preschool and kindergarten programs attended. First, the study examined the learning and home environments of the students in relation to early literacy skills. The Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale- Revised (ECERS-R) and the Early Language and Literacy Classroom Observation (ELLCO) were used to assess the quality of instruction in the preschool and kindergarten classrooms, respectively. Classrooms included in the study were found to be high quality early literacy environments as measured by these instruments. Second, a Home Literacy Survey, designed by the researcher, and vetted by an expert in the field of early childhood education was administered to the parents of the children in kindergarten. Data from the survey yielded little variation amongst groups in the literacy activities reported in in the home environments. All respondents reported engaging in literacy activities with their children on a frequent basis. Finally, scores for students on the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA) and the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills Next (DIBELS-Next) were obtained. Students were coded into three groups: no preschool, district based preschool, and state funded or private preschool. Data were analyzed using a MANOVA which found statistically significant results on the DIBELS-Next measure between students who attended the district based preschool and those who attended the state funded or private preschool program at the beginning of kindergarten. However, a second MANOVA completed on the end of the year data did not fine that these differences were maintained through the end of kindergarten. Limitations of the present study include small sample size, homogenous groups, disparate group sizes, teacher variability, instrument sensitivity, survey respondent bias, and statistical assumption violations. Recommendations for future research as well as implications for the field of education are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined how quantity and quality of early childhood education and care (ECEC) are related to the socio-emotional adjustment of children born in Germany (30–48 months old, N = 395). Previous research focused on a small set of ECEC features, used broad measures, and yielded inconclusive results. We assessed ECEC quantity (age at entry, hours per week), process quality (CLASS Pre-K), structural quality (child-teacher ratio), and classroom composition (percentage of immigrant children). Controlling for child, family, and teacher characteristics, we tested main and interaction effects in regression analyses. Research Findings: More hours per week predicted lower adjustment only on specific indicators (hyperactivity, conduct problems) and only in classrooms with a high percentage of immigrant children or a high child-teacher ratio. In addition, a higher child-teacher ratio predicted more conduct problems, but only for children who entered ECEC at a very young age. Process quality did not predict adjustment. Practice or policy: In sum, this implies that German ECEC does not pose a major risk for children’s socio-emotional adjustment, as only certain aspects of quantity and structural quality are linked to very specific socio-emotional outcomes under very specific circumstances.

AB  - Quality of education in day care institutions is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon that cannot be defined once and for all. Research has documented important prerequisites such as group size and relations between teachers and children. Quantitative measurements have been criticized, and it is recommended in stead to involve all parties in the definition of quality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research Findings: Using observational data gathered in 730 kindergarten classrooms in 6 states, the present study focuses on the quality of children's learning opportunities in kindergarten classrooms. Findings show that overall, children experience moderate to low levels of quality in the areas of classroom organization and instructional support in kindergarten. Results are also presented in comparison to children's experiences in the pre-kindergarten year. These comparisons indicate that kindergarten children spend a greater proportion of the school day in language arts, math, and whole-group instruction and less time in centers than they do in pre-kindergarten. An examination of predictors of kindergarten classroom quality indicated that program characteristics (i.e., adult-child ratio, length of school day) and teacher psychological variables (i.e., beliefs and depressive symptoms) were stronger predictors of classroom quality than were teacher experience and educational background. Practice or Policy: Findings are discussed in terms of implications for children's academic and social development in kindergarten as well as for kindergarten teacher preparation and development.

AB  - Examined the relationship between play-unit complexity and behavior of 24 normal 4–5 yr olds in 3 kindergartens in Vienna, Austria. Observations were made during periods of free play; study of the initial complete activity segments on each type of play unit (i.e., simple, complex) found that play-unit complexity had a significant relation to play-group size, degree of involvement, amount of pleasurable affect, and length of activity segments. Architectural design (e.g., the number of rooms in the kindergarten) seemed to affect the incidence of interrupted play. Thus, the psychological effect of group size seemed to be more dependent on spatial organization than on actual numbers or density. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study of 119 preschool programs in 5 states was designed to describe the classroom experiences of economically or educationally disadvantaged 4-year-old children and to examine linkages between characteristics of early childhood programs and the activities of the children and teachers in the classroom. Chapters 1 and 2 describe the context for the study and the study design. Chapter 3 reports the characteristics of the programs, classrooms, and staff observed, while chapter 4 chronicles the classroom day with regard to activities, groupings, and supervision. Chapters 5 and 6 examine interactions in the classroom and the measurement and prediction of the quality of the classroom experience, while chapter 7 presents the study's conclusions. Among the findings are that: (1) preschoolers spent over half their time in activities believed to foster cognitive growth; (2) in a substantial number of classrooms, activities that would be expected to be included in the daily curriculum, such as story-time or science and natural world activities, did not occur; and (3) lower child to staff ratios, higher teacher education levels, and higher levels of parent involvement were associated with all global measures of classroom quality. Implications of these results are also discussed. Three appendixes provide supporting tabular data, a profile of the "classroom snapshot" observational tool, and descriptions of four global quality measures. Includes 73 references. (MDM)

AB  - Child-staff ratios are an important quality indicator. They are often collected by observing one randomly selected classroom several times during a 2-h period on a single day. However, it is unclear whether these measures represent the ratios that children actually experience during most of their time in care. This study compared ratio data collected from a single classroom during a 2-h period on a single day with data collected from multiple classrooms in the same center during 8-h periods over 10 days. Analysis of data from 77 child care centers found moderate correlations between the two measurement methods. Ratios measured during a 2-h period from a single classroom on a single day tended to underpredict ratios measured from multiple classrooms and multiple days. Results suggest that the representativeness of ratio measurements can be improved by lengthening the observation period and especially by measuring ratios in multiple classrooms.

AB  - The quality of care offered in four different types of non-parental child care to 307 infants at 10 months old and 331 infants at 18 months old was compared and factors associated with higher quality were identified. Observed quality was lowest in nurseries at each age point, except that at 18 months they offered more learning activities. There were few differences in the observed quality of care by child-minders, grandparents and nannies, although grandparents had somewhat lower safety and health scores and offered children fewer activities. Cost was largely unrelated to quality of care except in child-minding, where higher cost was associated with higher quality. Observed ratios of children to adults had a significant impact on quality of nursery care; the more infants or toddlers each adult had to care for, the lower the quality of the care she gave them. Mothers' overall satisfaction with their child's care was positively associated with its quality for home-based care but not for nursery settings.

AB  - Current cross-linguistic and bilingual research suggests that the orthography of a language, language dominance, and language of reading instruction may all independently, and in interaction, influence the acquisition of word recognition skills in bilingual children. This study performs a concurrent and longitudinal evaluation of these factors' influence on reading development. It also examines the relation between reading-related cognitive processes (e.g., phonological awareness, rapid naming) and reading skills. Measures of reading and cognitive and linguistic abilities in both languages (English and Filipino) were administered to 81 bilingual (Filipino and English) boys at the beginning of Kindergarten, when they were entering their first year of formal reading instruction. The children were recruited from two schools in the Philippines, with one school providing instruction in Filipino and the other in English. Similar measures were administered one year later. Language preference was measured using factor scores derived from an exploratory factor analysis of a language questionnaire. These children's language preferences were represented along a continuum and varied across situations within individuals. Preferences differed depending on functional domains, and appeared to be influenced by sociocultural expectations and demands. Results indicate that the influence of language preference on reading was largely limited to reading comprehension in English. In general, English reading comprehension was predicted by language preference and cognitive measures with a heavier semantic language component. In contrast, reading decoding skills in both languages were better predicted by phonological awareness and rapid naming skills. Phonological awareness was generally related to decoding skills in both languages regardless of the nature of the orthography (regular versus irregular). Language of instruction was positively related to reading abilities: Reading instruction in Filipino predicted better performance on all the Filipino reading measures, while English instruction appeared to promote the development of English reading comprehension, but not English decoding. Language of instruction was naturally confounded with other variables like class size, teacher-to-student ratio, and instructional approach. Other linguistic, situational, and sociocultural variables may also be contributing to the complex interplay of language preference, language of instruction, and orthography and their relationship with reading skills in both English and Filipino.

AB  - The investigation focuses on environmental features of day care centers likely to affect emotional and stress reactions of toddlers in group settings. To assess stress reactions, the morning cortisol changes of 113 children (18 to 40 months) were analyzed in eight day care centers. Children's cortisol levels in the centers remained stable between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., whereas at home, as expected, cortisol levels decreased at the same time of day. Children's cortisol changes showed differences among the eight centers, suggesting the influence of environmental factors. Cortisol increases were related to large group sizes (n > 15), important age differences among children (> 6 months), less available area per child in the playrooms (< 5 m²), and unexpectedly, large number of caregivers in the team (> 4 adults). Overall, the findings support the claim that the physical and social attributes of preschool settings intervene in the regulation of children's bioemotional reactions.

AB  - The study investigates direct and indirect preschool quality effects on emergent literacy skills (children's letter knowledge, oral skills, and interests and skills in print and communication) using quality indicators at process (ECERS-R, ECERS-E), structure (e.g. class size) and belief (e.g. support creativity) level. The study included a sample of 547 children from 97 preschools and implemented standardised tests and teacher-ratings in the final preschool year, as well as observations and questionnaires throughout the preschool period. Multiple regression models reveal that ECERS-R was significantly related to children's teacher rated interest and skills in communication, and that ECERS-E predicted children's tested letter knowledge. Group size predicted children's interest and skills in print negatively, revealing lower scores in larger groups. With regard to beliefs, teachers' creativity and social support beliefs were negatively related with children's letter knowledge, whereas teachers' knowledge- and cultural-tools-oriented beliefs were positively related with interest and skills in communication. These effects were partly mediated through ECERS-E. Although the study provides evidence for effects of preschool quality on the development of children's emergent literacy skills and some evidence that effects of beliefs are partly mediated through process quality, effects are not consistent through the outcome variables and effect sizes are small.

AB  - Teacher-child relationships were examined as possible predictors of children's cortisol change in a preschool setting. Cortisol fluctuations across the day (daily change) for children (n = 186) in 17 full-day childcare classrooms were assessed in the morning and again in the afternoon on two days (one in Winter and one in Spring). In order to isolate the effects of the teacher-child relationships on cortisol, each child and his or her teacher took part in a one-on-one interaction episode outside of the classroom, and cortisol change was measured before and after the interaction episode (interaction change). Hierarchical Multivariate Linear Modeling (HMLM) was used to assess associations among teacher-child relationship qualities and cortisol change while taking into account or controlling for nested measurement (e.g., time since waking), child (e.g., sex and temperament), and classroom/teacher (e.g., group size and observed teacher negativity) effects. Morning to afternoon changes in cortisol replicated findings from previous research, with 51.2% and 45.8% of children showing increases in cortisol across the day, rather than the typical circadian pattern of decreases across the day. Modest stability was found for a.m. to p.m. cortisol change across the Winter and Spring assessments (r = .20, p < .05) with morning values showing the greatest consistency (r = .30, p < .001). Cortisol levels were associated with elapsed time since wake-up, but not with duration of sample collection. Teachers' reports of clingy relationships were associated with children's cortisol increases from morning to afternoon in the Winter classroom assessment. Teachers' reports of relationship conflict were associated with increases in cortisol across the teacher-child interaction task for boys but not girls. Child reports of relationship negativity were also marginally related to cortisol increases across the teacher-child interaction. Although the influence of teacher-child relationships on children's cortisol activity were not consistent across all measurement periods, the results provided a stringent test of the hypotheses and evidence that children's relationships with their teachers in the childcare setting may influence cortisol fluctuations, even after controlling for the effects of child, classroom, and measurement factors known to influence cortisol level.

AB  - Focusing on one aspect of a study examining the child-staff ratio in California state-subsidized day care centers, this paper explores the relationship between indicators of quality and the behavior of children in day care centers. In fall 1990, trained observers spent a week in 122 day care classrooms throughout California. During this time they rated teachers and aides, counted students, recorded interactions and activities, and coded children's behavior for 4 consecutive mornings. Two months later classrooms were randomly assigned a child-staff ratio configuration that they would be required to achieve and maintain for the spring session. One-third of the classrooms were asked to increase their ratio to 9:1; one-third to increase to a 10:1 ratio; and the final third to maintain an 8:1 ratio. Two months after the ratio change, observers returned and repeated the same observations in 112 classrooms. This paper presents findings from the spring data collection only. Analysis revealed that two aspects of child behavior were most consistently reflective of program quality: indicators of stress and other negative behaviors (crying and fighting); and percentage of time children were uninvolved in classroom activities. Classroom dynamics (including caregiver behavior) showed stronger relationships with children's behavior than did structural variables. (MM)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between two structural factors of quality: organisation form (stable groups versus flexible groups) and staff-child ratio, in relation to interaction quality in toddler groups in Norwegian early childhood education and care (ECEC). Data were collected from 206 kindergarten groups in the period from 2013 to 2015. Interaction quality was measured through the infant/toddler environment rating scale-revised subscales, Interaction, listening and talking, and program structure. A two-way MANOVA revealed that organisation form with small, stable groups were related to higher interaction quality, while the staff-child ratio and interaction quality varied depending on different content dimensions. These findings have clear implications for policy and the training of ECEC staff.

AB  - Previous research on the determinants of child care quality has led many to conclude that there is such substantial covariance between the quality of child care providers and the settings in which they work that the two are not meaningfully distinguishable. This study used data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care (when participating children were 24-months-old), to examine the relations between various aspects of the caregiving environment, caregiver traits and children's and adults' behavioral processes and interactions in the child care setting. Hierarchical regressions were used to test a model proposing that caregiver traits (e.g. formal training, beliefs about childrearing, professionalism) and characteristics of the environment (e.g. child-adult ratio, scheduling, learning materials) contribute independently to the prediction of these behavioral processes. Among child care center settings (N = 177) there was substantial support for the proposed model. The majority of behavioral processes in these settings (e.g. positive engagement between children and adults, children's prosocial behavior) were best predicted by the independence model. Among child care home settings (N = 184) there was support for both the covariance and independence models. Results suggest that the development and use of quality measures that disaggregate the contributions of individual caregivers and the environment from the behavioral processes in child care center settings would be useful for furthering research in this area and a more theoretically sound way to conceptualize the effects of child care on children's development.

AB  - Group-size effects, as changes in the adult language when speaking to individual or multiple children in two- and three-year-olds' Australian childcare centre classrooms were investigated. The language addressed to children by 21 staff members was coded for social (e.g., non-verbal, inferential and pragmatic), and linguistic (e.g., morphological, lexical, syntactic and referential) features. In the two-year-olds' classrooms, minimal differences were found between the language used in dyads (addressed to a single child) and polyads (addressed to more than one child). More extensive group-size effects, particularly in syntactic complexity, were found in the three-year-olds' classrooms. Explanations for the constancy of the adult language input in the younger classrooms, and the changes noted in the older rooms will be discussed in terms of plurality (i.e., more than one listener), methodology, and group-size effects that may be specific to the early childhood educational setting.

AB  - Massachusetts has a comprehensive system of early care and education that provides preschool programs for over 165,000 children, an estimated 27,600 of which attend preschool programs administered by public school systems. The second phase of the Massachusetts Cost and Quality Study examined 95 school-based, publicly administered preschool classrooms to determine characteristics, the quality of care and education, whether the quality varies by the family income of the children being served, what characteristics are linked to the quality of the school-based preschool classrooms, and the costs of public preschool education in public schools. Overall findings of this second phase of the study can be summarized as follows: (1) school-based, publicly administered preschool classrooms fill a particular niche in the early care and education market; (2) most of Massachusetts' publicly-administered preschool classrooms provide early care and education that meets or exceeds national standards for good quality; (3) three-quarters of the classrooms met or exceeded the Good benchmark on language and reasoning stimulation, and 87 percent met or exceeded the Good benchmark on social interactions; (4) the level of quality for public-school preschool programs serving lower income children was comparable to that of other public school programs in Massachusetts; (5) while the majority of the programs provide quality early care and education, there is room for improvement in opportunities for outdoor play and in meeting staff needs; (6) additional teacher training in early childhood education, beyond their formal education, such as the training provided by the Community Partnerships Children program, raises the level of language-reasoning stimulation provided to children in a given classroom; (7) teachers in classrooms with fewer children, as well as better ratios of children to instructional staff, provided greater warmth and sensitivity and greater teacher engagement with children; (8) classrooms that were NAEYC-accredited scored higher on both stimulation and warmth and sensitivity; (9) the majority of these preschool classrooms were inclusive classrooms, service both children with special needs and children without, and quality did not vary with the types of special education services offered, or the specific diagnoses of the children with special needs; and (10) per pupil expenditures in these inclusive preschool classrooms are estimated at $11,187 per year, or $21.68 per child hour, for preschool children with special needs and $3,236 per year or $6.27 per child hour, for children in the regular education program.

AB  - The Massachusetts Cost and Quality Study assessed the quality and costs of early care and education services in Massachusetts, the relationship between quality and costs, and the relationship between the family income of children served and the quality of care provided by early care and education programs. This report presents the findings from the final phase of the Massachusetts Cost and Quality Study, which examined the aforementioned assessments in community-based centers serving infants and toddlers. This study was designed to provide an accurate, up-to-date picture of the cost and quality of early care and education services for infants and toddlers, but it does not evaluate the effectiveness of specific regulations, subsidies, or other policies. The study of community-based centers serving infants and toddlers on a full-day, full-year basis found that classrooms with better child-to-staff ratios, more experienced and better educated teachers provided better quality care overall. This includes more developmentally-appropriate stimulation, and better relationships between classroom staff and children. Centers serving different income groups varied considerably in the quality of care they provided. Center directors reported diificulties in hiring qualified teachers. Evidence supports the belief that higher quality care and education costs more than poorer quality care and education. These data present compelling evidence that higher quality early care and education is associated with greater costs. Findings on relationship between labor and quality suggest the importance of hiring enough staff to maintain small group sizes and ratios, and hiring staff with education and experience to provide high quality infant and toddler care. In addition to these findings, this report provides descriptions of the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale (ITERS) benchmarks for early care and education, organized into seven scales: (1) Furnishings and Display; (2) Personal Care Routines; (3) Listening and Talking; (4) Learning Activities; (5) Interaction; (6) Program Structure; and (7) Adult Needs. An appendix provides the measurement and estimation for the cost-quality models. (Contains 3 tables and 22 figures.)

AB  - The Boston Public Schools (BPS) Department of Early Childhood commissioned a needs assessment of current kindergarten (K2) and preschool (K1) programs (1) to inform the BPS Department of Early Childhood about professional development needs to improve the quality of existing K1 and K2 programs; and (2) to inform the Department of additional classroom resources necessary to expand the K1 program to provide universal access for Boston 4 year olds to accredited, full day programs. This report is based on data collected from 43 K1 classrooms and 85 K2 classrooms in 67 different BPS schools in the 2005-2006 school year. Integrated classrooms were included in the sample, as were SEI and bilingual classrooms. The BPS Needs Assessment consisted of classroom observations, surveys of classroom teachers and school principals, as well as surveys completed by 844 families with children in the selected classrooms. The report makes nine recommendations: (1) Bring all K1 and K2 programs up to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) Early Childhood Program Standards and the BPS Citywide Learning Standards for Kindergarten; (2) Ensure that all classrooms meet the NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards for health and safety; (3) Provide all K1 and K2 classrooms with the equipment and materials needed to provide a high-quality early childhood program for all students; (4) Ensure that all K1 and K2 classrooms have a paraprofessional present for the entire day and that class sizes meet NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards of no more than 10 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K1, and no more than 12 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K2; (5) Ensure that all K1 and K2 classrooms have a paraprofessional present for the entire day and that class sizes meet NAEYC Early Childhood Program Standards of no more than 10 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K1, and no more than 12 children per teacher (and paraprofessional) in K2; (6) Boston currently has a system of mixed delivery of early childhood education, including the BPS Early Childhood programs, Head Starts and community centers. Planning efforts and programs of BPS Early Childhood should identify ways to strengthen this mixed delivery system to ensure all children enter school ready to learn; (7) Improve school bus transportation for K1 and K2 children; (8) Provide before and after school programs in the schools; and (9) Expand cooperation between schools and families through additional supports for family-school communication.

AB  - Agrowing trend in public education is the inclusion of four-year-olds, and volumes of research over the past four decades have documented the effects of preschool on children's development. Early studies of preschool programs for economically disadvantaged children compared children who attended with children who did not, and findings provide powerful evidence of short-term and long-term benefits of preschool. More recently, studies have examined the influence on development associated with a broad range of preschool characteristics including those regulated through polices (teachers' credentials, class size) and those that children directly experience (activities, materials, teacher interactions). Findings across these studies have been inconsistent, which may be attributed to the diverse study methods that have been used, or that preschool quality has differential effects for different groups of children. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between preschool quality and cognitive development among a statewide probability sample of four-year-olds in Georgia, using multiple measures of preschool quality and analytical techniques that attempted to account for selection effects (the tendency that higher performing children attend higher quality preschools) and negative correlations between children's performance when they begin preschool and the rate that they change over time. Children began preschool below national norms on three cognitive measures and developed at a faster rate than was expected by the end of kindergarten. Estimates of the variance in children's rates of development attributed to preschool settings were marginally different than zero, indicating that preschool settings had only a limited influence on the rates that children developed over time. Preschool quality was associated with children's performance at the beginning of preschool; however, only one aspect of quality-the location of the preschool-was associated with rates that children developed during preschool and kindergarten. Three aspects of preschool quality-overall quality, quality of the interactions, and location of the preschool within a school-had a stronger influence on rates of development among children who experienced certain social or economic risks. There was also evidence that rates of development of applied problem-solving skills were related to the degree of congruence between care-giving styles that children experience at home and preschool.

AB  - Two experiments addressed the effects of play group composition (segregated or integrated), type of play materials (functional, constructive, or dramatic), and group size (2 or 4 children) on the amount and diversity of peer-directed language used by preschool children with disabilities during play. Twenty-four children with disabilities, along with 12 peer playmates with disabilities and 12 typically developing playmates participated in each experiment. Dependent variables were rate of utterances, number of different words, and mean length of utterance transcribed from videotaped play sessions. Group composition and type of play materials had no significant effects. Group size had a significant multivariate effect on utterance rate and number of different words, with the children speaking more often when playing in dyads, but using more different words when playing in quartets.

AB  - Examined 718 infants (aged 11–17.9 mo), toddlers (aged 18–35.9 mo), and preschoolers (aged 36–61.7 mo), who were enrolled in 120 child-care centers from Massachusetts, Virginia, and Georgia, to determine the effects of quality of care on children's social outcomes. Four auspices of child-care centers were sampled: nonprofit, local for-profit, national chains for-profit, and church-sponsored. Social outcomes included mothers' ratings of attachment, observations of social skills in classroom, and parents' rating of behavior problems. Quality of care assessment was based on teacher characteristics, teacher:child ratio, and teacher–child interactions. In addition, child developmental patterns and family characteristics, such as work–family interference and family stress, were tested. Results show that there were few associations between teacher–child interaction and children's social outcomes. Higher work–family interference was associated with poorer social outcomes generally. Children in nonprofit centers had better social outcomes on some measures, although effects were small. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - THIS REPORT SUMMARIZES THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION EVALUATION OF ITS MORE EFFECTIVE SCHOOLS (MES) PROGRAM. MES, ESTABLISHED TO IMPROVE THE BASIC READING AND ARITHMETIC SKILLS OF DISADVANTAGED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CHILDREN, WAS INSTITUTED IN 21 SCHOOLS HAVING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PUPILS WITH LOW READING LEVELS, ENGLISH LANGUAGE HANDICAPS, AND POVERTY BACKGROUNDS. ITS SALIENT FEATURES WERE PRESCHOOL CLASSES, REDUCED CLASS SIZE, ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND ANCILLARY PERSONNEL, AND HETEROGENEOUS GROUPING. SOME OF ITS GOALS WERE TO CONDUCT THE PROGRAM IN INTEGRATED SCHOOLS AND TO ACTIVELY INVOLVE THE COMMUNITY. INNOVATIONS IN TEACHING METHODS AND MATERIALS WERE ALSO PART OF THE PROGRAM. ONE CHAPTER OF THE REPORT OUTLINES THE PROPOSED GOALS OF THE PROGRAM AND EXAMINES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WERE IMPLEMENTED. ANOTHER CHAPTER OFFERS SELECTED DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND THE FOLLOWING ONE REPORTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROJECT IN STIMULATING PUPIL GROWTH IN READING AND ARITHEMETIC. OTHER CHAPTERS DESCRIBE TWO LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND SUMMARIZE THE REACTIONS OF ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS, AND PARENTS TO THE MES PROGRAM. THE RESULTS OF THE APPRAISAL ARE "GENERALLY FAVORABLE." THE REDUCED CLASS SIZE AND PREKINDERGARTENS WERE SOME OF THE MOST VALUED FEATURES. TEST RESULTS SHOWED FAVORABLE PUPIL GROWTH IN READING, ARITHMETIC, SPEECH, AND ORAL COMMUNICATION. THE MAJOR RESERVATIONS WERE ABOUT THE GROUPINGS, THE LARGE ADDITION OF SCHOOL STAFF, AND THE NEED TO MEET THE DEMANDS TO ESTABLISH MES IN OTHER COMMUNITIES. (NH)

AB  - The present study investigated the measurement properties of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS) Toddler using data from 276 classrooms and 375 teachers in Dutch early childhood education and care provisions. First, confirmatory factor analyses based on the CLASS Toddler indicators confirmed the eight-dimension structure of the instrument. Second, a three-domain structure, involving Emotional Support, Behavioral Support and Engaged Support for Learning, fitted the data better than the commonly found two-domain structure that combines Emotional and Behavioral Support into one domain. Third, using Item Response Theory (IRT), we found good item difficulty and discrimination parameters of the CLASS Toddler indicators. Finally, significant associations were found between the CLASS Toddler domains and children-to-staff ratio, teachers' work experience and provided play and literacy activities, supporting the criterion validity of the instrument. Taken together, these results showed adequate measurement quality of the CLASS Toddler. Implications for practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Child care arrangements change as children age; in general, hours in home-based child care decrease as hours in center-based settings increase. This sequence of child care type may correspond with children's developmental needs; the small peer groups and low child-adult ratios typical of home-based care may allow for more individual child-adult time for infants and toddlers, whereas the social stimulation found in center-based care during the preschool years may prepare children for kindergarten. This study examined associations between school readiness and the timing of child care type among children in NICHD's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1349). Findings suggest that children who experience home-based care during the infant-toddler period and center care during the preschool period display the improved cognitive outcomes, but not the increased behavioral problems, generally associated with sustained center care attendance. Continuous home-based care was associated with higher social status at school entry partially through smaller peer groups during the preschool period. These patterns did not differ by child or family characteristics. Implications for policy and research are discussed. (Contains 7 tables.)

The model clarifies these variables' roles and explains regulation's potential costs and benefits. Regulation alone cannot improve overall child care quality. (18 references) (MLH)

AB  - Objectives. This study assessed outcomes for children when child care centers meet recommended care standards. Methods. Data from the NICHD Study Of Early Child Care were used to examine the association between meeting standards for child-staff ratios, group sizes, caregiver training, and caregiver education and children's development at 24 and 36 months of age. Results. There were 5 major findings: (1) most classes observed did not meet all 4 recommended standards (compliance ranged from 10% at 6 months of age to 34% at 36 months of age); (2) linear associations were found between number of standards met and child outcomes, and this was more the case at 36 months than at 24 months of age; (3) there was no evidence of threshold effects; (4) children in classes that met more standards had better school readiness and language comprehension scores as well as fewer behavior problems at 36 months of age; and (5) child outcomes were predicted by child-staff ratio at 24 months and caregiver training and education at 36 months of age. Conclusions. Outcomes were better when children attended classes that met recommended child-staff ratios and recommended levels of caregiver training and education.

AB  - This study was designed to experimentally examine how supplemental vocabulary instruction provided in either whole-group or small-group settings influences low-income preschoolers' word knowledge and conceptual development. Using a within-subject design, 108 preschool children from 12 Head Start classrooms participated in an 8-week intervention, which included four topics of targeted vocabulary instruction counterbalanced in either a whole-group or small-group configuration. Pre- and posttest measures examined children's outcomes in word learning and in conceptual and categorical knowledge. Our results indicated that group size did not appear to be a powerful mechanism for intensifying instruction. Although children gained significantly in word knowledge, concepts, and categories, they did so regardless of whether they were in small or whole groups. Implications for these findings, as well as limitations of the research and directions for future research, are discussed.

AB  - This paper presents evidence of the need to apply specific levels of competence to day care center staff, and describes the impact of these levels of competence on the children receiving care. Nine categories of staff necessary for quality day care are discussed and the duties of each are outlined. The categories are center director, director of social services, coordinator of volunteers, coordinator of parent activities, director of nutrition, health personnel, custodial staff, teachers and teacher aides. A discussion of the experience and training requirements of direct caregivers covers the following areas: traditional training, non-traditional training, competence-based training and certification. Finally, the paper examines the impact of staff personality characteristics and behavior on the development and academic achievement of children. This examination focuses on the age, warmth, gratification derived from interaction, emotional maturity, aspects of personal history, and certain aspects of the experience of the staff. Staff:child ratios are considered an important variable in the development of the child. The development of a screening process for hiring staff and the development of criteria for judging the competence of the on-going staff are recommended. (CM)

AB  - This paper presents data concerning the use and costs of center and family day care programs in Sweden. The typical center provides full-time care and has 4 sections, each with 2 preschool teachers, 1 attendant, and up to 20 children. In the family day care system, municipalities employ caregivers and parents pay the municipality. This paper discusses two studies in which: staff activities and social interaction were observed; data on staff/child ratios were collected; and parent and staff attitudes were assessed. The first study examined these factors for 6 day care centers; the second, for 29 caregivers and 110 parents involved in family day care programs. Results indicated that there were more toddlers in center care than family care, and more school-aged children in family care than center care. In family care programs, adults worked alone with a group of children; in centers, staff worked together with children. Educational activities were a dominant concern in center care; preparatory activities received precedence in family care. Family caregivers were more satisfied with their work than were center staff. On the whole, however, the results showed greater similarities than differences between center and family day care. A 15-item reference list is provided. (BC)

AB  - The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care has enrolled more than 1,300 children and followed most of them through the first 7 years of their lives to determine how variations in child care are related to their development. This booklet describes the study and its findings. Findings are divided into four main categories. The first set of descriptive findings paints a picture of the care that children in the NICHD study are receiving. This includes a look at the "regulable" characteristics of care, such as the adult to child ratio, the patterns of care used during the first year of life, and child care for children in poverty. Other categories include the role of family for children in child care, child care and its relationship to children's development, and child care and children's relationship with their mothers. Within these categories are findings related to the extent to which child care experiences are associated with different developmental outcomes for low-income children compared to more affluent children, and for minority children compared to white non-Hispanic children. There are also comparisons of current and past child care experiences as predictors of children's performance or mother-child interaction. Main findings of the study include that in general, family characteristics and the quality of the mother's relationship with the child were stronger predictors of children's development than child care factors, but that some child care characteristics or experiences do contribute slightly but significantly to children's development.

AB  - Evaluated the 'global' quality of the caregiving environment for young infants and toddlers in day care centers in Athens, investigating the role quality characteristics play in the course of child development. Factors evaluated included the 'structural' and 'dynamic' features in terms of group size, adult-child ratio, caregiving style, and interaction patterns developed between the caregivers and children. Children were 60 18-mo olds experiencing full-time (more than 20 hrs/wk) day care provision, and for at least 6 mo out-of-home care, while attending 25 day care centers. Children's assessments included measures of cognitive, language, and socio-emotional development. Interviews and observational techniques were used to assess the quality of the day caregiving environment and the interaction processes between caregivers and the children. Children's development was considered in terms of the quality of out-of-home care experience. It was found that the course of development could be predicted by the overall day care center quality index as measured by the Infant/Toddler Environment Rating Scale, with the separate contribution of some other variables according to the examined developmental aspect.

AB  - The 'global' quality of the caregiving environment for young infants and toddlers in day care centres in Athens, the 'structural' and 'dynamic' features in terms of group size, the adult child ratio, the caregiving style and, finally, the interaction patterns developed between the caregivers and the children, were all factors evaluated for potential developmental effects. Participants in the study were 60 toddlers, experiencing full-time (more than 20 hours/week) day care provision, and for at least 6 months out-of-home care, while attending 25 day care centres located in the greater Athens area. Children's assessments included measures of cognitive, language and socio-emotional development. Interviews and observational techniques were used to assess the quality of the day caregiving environment and the interaction processes between caregivers and the children. Children's development was considered in terms of the quality of out-of-home care experience. It was found that the course of development could be predicted by the overall day care centre quality index as measured by the ITERS scale, with the separate contribution of some other variables according to the examined developmental aspect. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Dans le cadre d'une recherche concernant les influences possibles sur le developpement des enfants, nous avons etudie les facteurs suivants: l'evaluation 'globale' de la qualite de l'environnement des services de soin et d'education dans les creches d'Athenes, les caracteristiques 'structurelles' et 'dynamiques' concernant la taille du groupe d'enfants en classe, l'analogie institutrices/enfants, le style de soin et de comportement de l' institutrice, enfin, le style d'interaction entre institutrices et enfants. Dans cette recherche ont participe 60 enfants de 18 mois, frequentant 25 creches de la region d'Athenes pour plus de 20 heures par semaine et pour une duree d'au moins 6 mois au moment de la recherche. L'appreciation du developpement des enfants concernait le domaine cognitif, langagier et socio-emotionel. Pour l'evaluation de la qualite de l'environnement des creches et les processus d'interaction entre institutrices et enfants, nous nous sommes servi de methodes d'interview et d'observation. Le developpement des enfants a ete´ evalue en fonction de la qualite de l'environnement des creches. Nous avons conclu que le developpement est correle avec la qualite globale de la creche, telle qu'elle a ete calcule avec l'echelle ITERS. Par ailleurs, nous avons observe la contribution d'autres variables selon le secteur etudie du developpement. La apreciacion global de la calidad del ambiente de la prestacion de servicios de cuidados y educacion a los ninos en las guarderias infantiles de Atenas, las caracteristicas estructurales y dinamicos que conciernen al numero de los ninos en la clase, a la proporcion maestras/ninos, al estilo de la prestacion del cuidado y del comportamiento de las maestras y, en fin, al esquema de interaccion entre maestras y ninos han sido los factores que se han examinado en cuanto a su possible influencia sobre el desarrollo de los ninos. En nuestra investigacion participaron 60 ninos de 18 meses de edad que frecuentaban 25 guarderias en la region de Atenas durante mas de 20 horas a la semana y por lo menos 6 meses hasta la investigacion. La apreciacion del desarrollo de los ninos se refiere al sector cognitivo, verbal y socio-emocional. Para la evaluacion de la calidad del ambiente de las guarderias y para los procedimientos de intercambio entre maestras y ninos se han utilizado las tecnicas de la entervista y de la observacion. El desarrollo de los ninos se ha apreciado en relacion con la calidad del ambiente de las guarderias. Ha resultado evidente que el curso del desarrollo guarda relacion con la calidad general de la guarderia, la cual se ha evaluado segun la escala ITERS, mientras se ha notado tambien el aporte de otras variables, segun el aspecto del desarrollo estudiado.

AB  - This study examined the influence on children's social development of variation in the quality of their child-care environments. The sample consisted of 166 children attending representative child-care centers that varied widely in quality. Possible relations associated with age, child-care experience, and family background were controlled using hierarchical multiple regression. Both global estimates of child-care quality and specific program features, such as director experience, ratios, and verbal interactions, were obtained from observational measures and staff questionnaires. Measures of social development were derived from parent and caregiver ratings of the children. Of greatest importance is the finding that overall quality, caregiver–child verbal interactions, and director experience were each highly predictive of the children's social development in child care. Family background measures were also significantly predictive of several of the social outcomes, whereas child-care experience showed few significant effects. The implications for social policies and future research in child care are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Examined effects on the quality of children's child care environments of (a) the stringency of state child care regulations, (b) voluntary compliance with proposed federal child care standards, and (c) the legal auspice of the center. Quality of care was assessed in 227 child care centers in five metropolitan areas. Centers in states with more stringent child care regulations tended to have better staff-child ratios, staff with more child-related training, and lower staff turnover rates. Similarly, centers that more fully complied with the ratio, group size, and training provisions of a set of proposed federal child care standards had significantly lower staff turnover rates, more age-appropriate classroom activities, less harsh and more sensitive teachers, and more teachers with specialized training. For-profit centers offered children less optimal care than did nonprofit centers. These findings are placed in the context of ecological models of research and of contemporary policy debates about child care.

AB  - This study reports data from a multisite study of typical center-based child care and children's development regarding (a) associations among quality of care defined by structural features, process indicators, and compliance with state regulations, (b) variation in quality based on the stringency of state child care regulations and center compliance, and (c) specific quality indicators that show especially strong links to children's experiences in child care. Findings confirmed prior evidence regarding the importance of ratios, teacher training, and group size for high quality classroom processes, but demonstrated the more significant contribution of teacher wages and parent fees. Both structural and process measures of quality varied with the location of the center in a state with more or less stringent child care regulations. The results indicate the importance of incorporating economic and regulatory considerations into future studies of childcare quality.

AB  - Storybook reading in child care classrooms typically occurs in one large group, a context that does not provide opportunities for each child to talk about the book. Two-year-old children, in particular, need individual support to facilitate their language participation, and they want to touch the book and be close to the teacher. The purpose of the present study was to determine if reducing group size would increase 2-year-old children's engagement and verbal participation during storybook reading, and to describe their nonverbal participation. Fifteen 2-year-old children and six teachers in two classrooms participated. A multiple baseline across settings time-series experimental design was used. Videotapes were transcribed and coded for children's engagement, comments and questions, and nonverbal participation. Observations of book use were conducted during freeplay. The average number of comments and questions per child approximately doubled when reading occurred in small groups. Children participated nonverbally by actions such as pointing, handling books, moving close to the teacher, interacting with peers, and pretending. The results indicate that reducing group size can be an effective method for increasing the verbal participation of 2-year-old children during storybook reading in child care classrooms. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of ecological context, and ways of including small group storybook reading in the daily schedule are suggested.

AB  - Research Findings: This study investigated the relationship between features of the classroom environment and misalignment between teacher and observer ratings of preschoolers’ classroom engagement and the extent to which years of teaching experience moderated this relationship. In a sample of 116 preschoolers and 21 teachers in 29 classrooms, classroom engagement was assessed using teacher report and independent direct observation. Classroom-level predictors included severity of challenging behaviors, child:adult ratio, and the percentage of students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Lower misalignment was noted on ratings of negative engagement than positive engagement. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that misalignment was largely independent of variation in classroom factors, except for a consistent interaction between years of teaching experience and child:adult ratio. Specifically, observers’ ratings were less misaligned with novice teachers’ ratings than veterans’ in classrooms with a high child:adult ratio, whereas the opposite trend was found in classrooms with low child:adult ratios. Practice or Policy: Findings are discussed in light of current best practice calling for a multidisciplinary approach when conducting assessments on young children, despite little guidance on how to handle misalignment between raters when determining service eligibility and developing effective interventions.

AB  - We observed 223 largely suburban or rural public school kindergarten classrooms in 3 states to describe classroom activities and child-teacher interactions involving I child per classroom. We also observed global classroom quality and assessed its relation to teacher, school, classroom, and family characteristics and target child outcomes. Classrooms were observed once for 3 hours starting at the beginning of the school day. Time samplings of activities, teacher behaviors, and child behaviors as well as global ratings of teacher-target child interactions and the classroom environment were obtained. The most frequently observed forms of activity were structured teacher-directed activity and whole-group instruction. There was tremendous variation in the occurrence of these activities across classrooms, ranging from 0% to 100% of the observation period. Global ratings of teachers' positive interactions with the target child, classroom instructional climate, and classroom child-centered climate were lower when the concentration of poverty in the school was high, when the target child's family income was low, and when the number of staff available to work with children in that classroom was low. Target students' observed social and on-task behavior and teachers' reports of social and academic competence for target children were higher when these global ratings indicated higher quality, even controlling for family background factors. These data may have implications for educational policies on class size and composition, and issues of equity in early school experiences.

AB  - Seventy culturally deprived preschool children, primarily of Mexican-American ethnicity, were chosen to participate in this study of self-perception. One of the most important aspects of a child's personality development concerns the conceptions he has of himself. It is posited that two important influences upon these conceptions are (1) interpersonal relationships and (2) physical environment. To test these postulates, 39 of the subjects of this study were placed in an experimental class presided over by mothers with no teacher training and with a ratio of one adult to four children. The remaining preschoolers attended a regular Head Start class. It was hypothesized that all subjects would demonstrate greater sensitivity to their own selves at the conclusion of the 6-week summer program than they had at the beginning and that the children in the experimental class would show a more significant change in accuracy of self-perception than the others because of the low adult-child ratio. A Doll-Self Point task and a Draw-A-Person task were used as pretests and posttests. The results from these tasks supported the first part of the hypothesis and, with reservations, the second part. Although the experimental class group showed significantly greater increases in self-drawing scores, they also had higher pretest scores. (WD)

AB  - Three studies examined aspects of child care in New Zealand. In the first study, supervisors of 38 child care centers were interviewed about the organization of their centers. Based on the responses, categories were developed to describe the type of center, the persons responsible for management decisions, organization of care by age grouping, and the number of children under 2 years of age attending the center. Six of the centers responding were selected for further examination in the second study. In this study, the interactions of caregivers with 36 infants and toddlers were observed. Behaviors observed most frequently included infant's solitary activity, caregiver's talking to infants, infant's peer interactions, and caregiver's touching. Behaviors observed least frequently included caregiver's expression of negative affect and infant's violation of adult standards. Child-staff ratio was noted, and behaviors were correlated to type of center. The third study was designed to gather information on the needs of children in care. Interviews conducted with parents and supervisors at the six selected centers revealed infants' emotional, social, cognitive, and health needs. Several parental, staff, and community needs were also identified. Implications of the study for staff management and training, curriculum, government support, and further research are discussed. Eight references are cited. (BC)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to document the impact of a targeted financial investment on the quality of Head Start programs over a period of five years. After 10 years of neglect and dwindling investment during the 1980s, the quality of the program was at an all-time low while enrollment levels were approaching all-time highs. A major shift in public policy was made by passage of the Head Start Expansion and Improvement Act of 1990, which required that 25 percent of all 'new' funding (after inflation) be set aside for improving program quality. This study explored the impact of this fiscal investment on indicators of quality currently available through national data. The primary concern was whether there was a change in quality during the five year period supported by the data for two types of quality; structural (child-adult ratio, child group size, family-staff ratio, staff turnover, and staff education) and service delivery (average daily attendance, health service performance, immunization rates, family service performance, and parent participation in parenting education). A second concern was whether the lower scoring programs on these measures in 1990 had improved in comparison to the total. The third issue was whether the initial size, initial quality, and/or growth rates impacted the programs' ability to improve. Finally, the study investigated the relationship between the indices of structural quality in 1990 and the indices of service delivery quality in 1995. The findings indicate that fiscal investment has significantly improved all indices structural quality, and that lower scoring programs in 1990 have made greater improvement than any other group in spite of the impact of initial size, quality, and/or growth. Additionally, a moderating effect was found between child group sizes and staff education in 1990 and the performance on some service delivery indices in 1995.

AB  - This study examined how well (i) structural measures which are monitored by the government such as the physical environment, Health/Safety, Staff qualifications and Staff-child ratios; and (ii) management-related measures such as administration/evaluation, and Staff-parent interactions predicted process quality of preschools in Hong Kong. Focusing on provision for 4-year-olds, 60 preschools, representative of the range of preschools in Hong Kong, were observed to determine process quality. Information about structural measures was obtained through interviews of principals/supervisors and complemented by observations. Results indicated significant intercorrelations among structural, management-related and process measures. There was considerable variability in process quality with higher process quality evident in preschools which exceeded government requirements for staff qualifications, space and equipment, and staff-child ratios. Structural and management-related measures significantly contributed to prediction of process quality and accounted for 27% of the variance in it. These findings have implications for increasing the stringency of regulatory requirements and training focusing on the management of preschools in Hong Kong.

AB  - Highlights • Confirmatory Factor Analysis provided support for the CLASS 3-factor structure. • The CLASS functions equally well in classrooms serving children with disabilities. • The CLASS functions equally well in classrooms from socially disadvantaged areas. • Modest associations between structural features and CLASS domains were found. Abstract This study investigates process quality and structural features of classrooms serving children at-risk of poverty and social exclusion and children with disabilities in Portugal. We examine (a) whether the three-domain structure of a widely used standard observational tool, the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta, LaParo, & Hamre, 2008) describes adequately teacher–child interactions in those classrooms and (b) associations between CLASS domains and structural features, including teacher education and group size. The study was conducted in 178 preschool classrooms. Data included classroom observations using the CLASS Pre-K and teacher reports on structural features. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the three domains of teacher–child interactions. In addition, the CLASS domains described teacher–child interactions equally well across classrooms serving children with disabilities and children at-risk of poverty and social exclusion. Finally, we found modest associations between structural features and CLASS organizational and instructional support, suggesting a complex interplay among structural features in predicting levels of teacher–child interactions.

AB  - Analyzes how social dynamics in early childhood classrooms change from fall to spring & from early to late preschool, based on sociometric ratings & peer contact patterns recorded during the fall & spring on a sample of 92 preschoolers in age-stratified (age 3, 4, & 5) classrooms. From early to late preschool, children's sociometric ratings became increasingly negative, especially toward cross-sex contacts, although the changes were not as linear as those in the sociometric ratings. The analysis of group sizes showed that the 4-year-olds spent more time in larger groups than both their younger & older peers did. Group sociometric ratings & contact patterns changed from fall to spring, but individual children showed considerable stability in the sociometric ratings that they gave their peers & in the size & gender composition of their play groups. 4 Tables, 30 References.

AB  - This dissertation used nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) to explore relationships between full-day kindergarten classroom factors, family socioeconomic status (SES), and public school children's gains in reading achievement and academic engagement over their first formal year of schooling. Specifically, the study focused on two aspects of kindergarten classroom factors that could maximize the additional time provided by full-day programs: instructional resources (i.e., class size and instructional aides) and instructional practices (i.e., time allocation across subject areas, grouping strategies, and instructional skills and activities). Two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses (i.e., full-day kindergartners nested within public schools) were conducted to investigate the effects of school-averaged classroom factors on children's reading and academic engagement gains over the kindergarten year, as well as possible effects of school-averaged classroom factors on the relationship between children's SES and the aforementioned outcomes. The study identified multiple classroom factors associated with overall differences in full-day kindergartners' average reading gains. Specifically, results suggested that increases in reading instructional time, decreases in class size, and a balance in the frequency of discrete literacy skills and comprehension-based skills could help to accelerate reading gains during the kindergarten year. This study did not find evidence to support concerns that full-day kindergarten programs might harm children's academic engagement because of an overemphasis on academics. Instead, full-day kindergartners' academic engagement tended to remain constant across the kindergarten year and did not vary in relation to most instructional practices. Results indicated that full-day kindergartners demonstrated increased academic engagement in schools that had instructional aides working at least one hour per day with kindergartners. This study also found that the effects of family SES did not vary between schools, so average classroom resources and practices did not influence differentially the reading achievement gains or the academic engagement gains of students from different SES backgrounds. In sum, this dissertation helps to provide some of the first evidence on how full-day kindergarten programs might structure instructional resources and time-related instructional practices in ways that increase children's reading achievement and academic engagement.

AB  - In this Norwegian study, bidirectional relations between children's behavior problems and child-teacher conflict and closeness were examined, and the possibility of moderation of these associations by child-care group size was tested. Eight hundred and nineteen 4-year-old children were followed up in first grade. Results revealed reciprocal effects linking child-teacher conflict and behavior problems. Effects of child-teacher closeness on later behavior problems were moderated by group size: For children in small groups only (i.e., ≤ 15 children), greater closeness predicted reduced behavior problems in first grade. In consequence, stability of behavior problems was greater in larger than in smaller groups. Results are discussed in light of regulatory mechanisms and social learning theory, with possible implications for organization of child care.

AB  - Considers the effects of gender, teacher's specialization, class size, and the interaction between them on children's adjustment to kindergarten as measured by teachers using the Child at School Schedule. The sample consisted of 240 children in kindergarten classes attached to primary schools. Results show that boys were perceived to be less well adjusted to kindergarten than girls. Children under supervision of an unprofessional teacher were perceived to be less well adjusted to kindergarten than children under the supervision of a professional teacher. Children in large size classes were perceived to be less well adjusted to kindergarten than children in small size classes. Lastly, the interaction between teacher's proficiency and class size did have an effect on children's adjustment to kindergarten classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - How quality of center-based child care relates to early cognitive and language development was examined longitudinally from 6 to 36 months of age in a sample of 89 African American children. Both structural and process measures of quality of child care were collected through observation of the infant classroom. Results indicated that higher quality child care was related to higher measures of cognitive development (Bayley Scales of Infant Development), language development (Sequenced Inventory of Communication Development), and communication skills (Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales) across time, even after adjusting for selected child and family characteristics. In addition, classrooms that met professional recommendations regarding child:adult ratios tended to have children with better language skills. Classrooms that met recommendations regarding teacher education tended to have girls with better cognitive and receptive language skills. These findings, in conjunction with the growing child-care literature, provide further evidence that researchers and policymakers should strive to improve the quality of child care to enhance early development of such vulnerable children.

AB  - Though quality in early childhood education and care has attracted last decades enormous research interest there is still not a unanimous agreement about its definition. Yet, almost all definitions attempted include interaction, group size, adult:child ratio and early childhood educators' level of education, as important indices of quality. Relationships are key resources for young children. There is agreement among researchers that the quality of caregiving by professional caregivers in child care centres has been established as an important influence on various aspects of child development. Thus, structural characteristics have been proven to affect programs' quality of services provided. The purpose of this research study was twofold: (1) to explore the quality of interaction between Greek early childhood educators and children; and (2) to record the structural characteristics of Greek child care centres. Correlations among structural characteristics and type of interaction were also examined. Research data indicate that Greek early childhood educators are positive but at the same time detached and permissive during their interaction with children, a finding that disputes their positive interaction. Thus, Greek child care centres have been found to adopt, based on Greek legislation, high ratios and group sizes, a finding which raises questions about the effects on children's well being and development. Limited correlations have been found between the type of interaction and the structural characteristics. Research data highlight the need for further research to undergone and for changes in Greek legislation, concerning the operation of Greek child care centres.

AB  - Compared the frequencies of peer and adult social interactions, the mean durations of social interactions, and the amounts of negative behaviors of 3-, 4-, and 5-yr-old children of both sexes (N = 131) in a Montessori nursery school, a university laboratory preschool, and a parent cooperative nursery school. The total amount of social interaction, the amount of peer interaction, and the duration of the average social interaction increased with age. The Montessori Ss differed from the Ss in the other 2 schools in amount of peer interaction and in duration of the average interaction in the same direction as older Ss differed from younger Ss. This finding suggests that teacher ratio and age distribution factors enhance the development of social interaction skills in Montessori nursery school children. (18 ref.)

AB  - The authors report on a research project aimed at identifying differences between day nurseries in relation to staff and child behaviour. Six day nurseries were studied in London: staff levels and behaviour were measured against child behaviour and interactions between adults and children. They conclude that management styles, group size and staff attitudes to parents affect staff behaviour and consequently problem behaviour in children. The work was supported by a grant from the Department of Health and Social Security. This paper is based in part upon a presentation to the Annual Conference of the British Psychological Society, Leeds, April 1988.

AB  - Observations were conducted in Israel on 47 toddlers in sponsored family day care, 18 toddlers in community-based center day care, and 20 toddlers in kibbutz children's homes in an effort to identify differences in the three types of care. Particular attention was given to characteristics of users and caregivers, experiences generated by the educational environment, and toddlers' behavior. Findings showed no differences between family day care and centers in caregivers' characteristics (except for experience), educational program, and quality of physical environment. In centers, caregivers offered interaction of a poorer quality and the emotional tone of the program was less relaxed than in family day care. But no differences were observed in the children's behavior. Kibbutz child care rated highest on all structural indicators of quality: small groups; high adult-to-child ratio; education, training, and experience of caregivers; and physical environment. Although there were no differences in the behavior of caregivers in kibbutz and family day care, kibbutz children engaged more than family day care children in positive learning experiences and social behavior. Analyses supported the contention that the quality of the educational environment, rather than the type of child care, determines differences in learning experience. (Author/RH)

It was hypothesized that the children in the treatment group would perform better on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory than their control counterparts. Findings for whole group differences suggested that there was no relationship between the professional development training on joint attention and language development. However, when controlling for adult:child ratio, the children in the treatment group did perform better. Additionally, the children within the treatment group whose child care providers engaged in more frequent and longer bouts of joint attention performed better than their within group counterparts. It is generally concluded that adult:child ratio affects the effectiveness of joint attention professional development for child care staff in less than quality child care centers. In addition, level of implementation is a factor in assessing the relationship between joint attention professional development for child care staff and children's language development.

AB  - Research Findings: Continuity of care is a recommended practice in child care intended to promote secure and supportive relationships between infants and toddlers and their caregivers. Toddlers (N = 115) between 12 and 24 months were observed in 30 continuity and 29 noncontinuity classrooms. The average duration of care for toddlers with caregivers was 14 months in the continuity rooms and 5 months in noncontinuity rooms. Toddlers observed in continuity rooms experienced higher levels of interactive involvement with their caregivers and were rated by their caregivers as having fewer problem behaviors compared with the toddlers in noncontinuity rooms. Toddlers in rooms with higher staff–child ratios also experienced more involved caregiving. We did not find evidence that the level of involved caregiving mediated the association between continuity of care and toddlers’ social competence or problem behaviors. Practice or Policy: Continuity of care may be a promising practice for programs that strive to provide high-quality care for infants and toddlers.

AB  - This study investigated questions adults asked to children with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive pre-kindergarten classrooms, and whether child (e.g. autism severity) and setting (i.e. adult-to-child ratio) characteristics were related to questions asked during center-time. Videos of verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (n = 42) were coded based on the following question categories adapted from the work of Massey et al.: management, low cognitive challenging, or cognitively challenging. Results indicated that management questions (mean = 19.97, standard deviation = 12.71) were asked more than less cognitively challenging questions (mean = 14.22, standard deviation = 8.98) and less cognitively challenging questions were asked more than cognitively challenging questions (mean = 10.00, standard deviation = 6.9). Children with higher language levels had a greater likelihood of receiving cognitively challenging questions (odds ratio = 1.025; p = 0.007). Cognitively challenging questions had a greater likelihood of being asked in classrooms with more adults relative to children (odds ratio = 1.176; p = 0.037). The findings present a first step in identifying the questions directed at preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder in inclusive classrooms.

AB  - Assessment of quality of care (QOC) in 363 classrooms with infants, toddlers, and preschool children was conducted in 120 child care centers in 3 states. Assessment measures included Infant and Toddler Environment Rating Scale, Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, and the Assessment Profile for Early Childhood Programs. Regulatable aspects of quality of child care included ratio of caregivers to children, group size, teacher training in child development or child care, teacher education, highest wage paid to a center teacher, and staff turnover. Process measures proved to be highly redundant, both internally and with each other. Much smaller sets of items, drawn randomly from the instruments' item pools, were found to be perfectly acceptable measures of QOC. Regulatable measures did not prove to be acceptable measures of QOC, except for teachers' wages, which were highly correlated with process measures of quality.

AB  - Background. Adult-child teaching interactions have been found to hell! children move to higher and more advanced levels of cognitive thinking and reasoning. Aims, The investigation of whether nursery nurses offer more verbal and non-verbal instructions when interacting with 3-year-old than 4-year-old children, a dyad than a tetrad, girls than boys and as the difficulty of the task increases. Samples. Four hundred and eighty 3- and 4-year-old preschoolers (240 boys and 240 girls) of middle class background from 25 nurseries in the area of Athens, Greece, were observed interacting with 40 nursery nurses while reproducing a numerical task. Methods. Each nursery nurse interacted with a dyad and a tetrad of children of each age group while solving a task of numerical correspondence consisting of three, six, or nine elements. Each child was expected to reproduce in succession a model array of cubes that the nursery nurse presented to them. All sessions were videotaped. Results. Nursery nurses made significantly more verbal and non-verbal instructional shifts when addressing 3-year-olds, dyads, and as the level of the task became progressively more difficult. Sex was not found to significantly affect nursery nurses' behaviour. Furthermore 4-year-olds were more successful in completing the task at all levels of difficulty. Conclusions, Nursery nurses adjust both the quality and quantity of their instructions according to the demands of the children with whom they interact. Their teaching methods in small groups are influenced by variables such as age, group size and task difficulty level.

AB  - The Haifa Study of Early Child Care recruited a large-scale sample (N = 758) that represented the full SES spectrum in Israel, to examine the unique contribution of various child-care-related correlates to infant attachment. After controlling for other potential contributing variables--including mother characteristics, mother-child interaction, mother-father relationship, infant characteristics and development, and the environment--this study found that center-care, in and of itself, adversely increased the likelihood of infants developing insecure attachment to their mothers as compared with infants who were either in maternal care, individual nonparental care with a relative, individual nonparental care with a paid caregiver, or family day-care. The results suggest that it is the poor quality of center-care and the high infant-caregiver ratio that accounted for this increased level of attachment insecurity among center-care infants.

AB  - In this Norwegian study, bidirectional relations between children's behavior problems and child-teacher conflict and closeness were examined, and the possibility of moderation of these associations by child-care group size was tested. Eight hundred and nineteen 4-year-old children were followed up in first grade. Results revealed reciprocal effects linking child-teacher conflict and behavior problems. Effects of child-teacher closeness on later behavior problems were moderated by group size: For children in small groups only (i.e., = 15 children), greater closeness predicted reduced behavior problems in first grade. In consequence, stability of behavior problems was greater in larger than in smaller groups. Results are discussed in light of regulatory mechanisms and social learning theory, with possible implications for organization of child care.

AB  - A total of 96 students identified as academically at risk were selected to participate in an extended-day kindergarten program featuring small class size and a whole-language approach to the curriculum and learning. High-risk students attended regular morning kindergarten classes as well as the extended-day sessions; comparison students attended morning classes only. Additional instruction time for the high-risk students ranged from 119 to 242 hours, depending upon which of five participating schools the students attended. A pretest posttest design was used to compare gains on the Listening subtest of the California Achievement Test, Part C, made by 33 students participating in five extended-day classrooms with gains made by 191 students in the same or similar schools who attended half-day kindergarten classes. A similar analysis was performed on gains on the "Prueba Boehm de Conceptos Basicos" made by 14 participants and 27 nonparticipants with limited English-speaking ability. The extended-day kindergarten was found to have a positive effect on the achievement of students regardless of students' language background. Program participants made statistically and educationally significant gains on standardized tests and on teacher ratings of classroom performance. In one school, where all 29 students participated in two extended-kindergarten classrooms, pretest posttest gains on the Metropolitan Readiness Test were higher than in previous years. (Author/RH)

AB  - This report concerns the results of Phase III of the National Day Care Study (NDCS). Phases I and II were preparatory to the experimental manipulations conducted in Phase III, and are reported elsewhere. Thirty-two day care centers in Atlanta and 16 each in Detroit and Seattle were selected for participation in the study. NDCS resources allowed for the selection of three cities: Atlanta, Detroit, and Seattle. These sites were chosen because they showed sufficient variability on the main independent variables to allow for the logical generalization of study effects to day care centers not included in the study sample. A consistent pattern of results emerged across different data sets and indicators of quality. The quality of the day care experience for young children was found to be significantly affected by the way in which both the psychological and physical environment is organized. NDCS results have helped to clarify the dynamics of center-based care for young children. Previously, staff-child ratio was thought to be the prime structural ingredient in assuring a good experience for young children in day care. The study concludes that federal regulations governing day care center subsidies should (1) tighten the ceiling on group size while relaxing the stringency of caregiver-child ratios, and (2) require caregivers to have child-related training/education. Since only ratio is strongly related to cost, implementing these conclusions would result in better care for children at lower cost. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Describes a series of experiments conducted over a 3-yr period with play groups of about 24 children each (mean age approximately 3 yrs) to investigate the effects of class size, nature and amount of play equipment, space available, and staff caretaking style on children's behavior and development. Findings show that, in more crowded conditions, socially cooperative play decreased and aggression increased; that providing more play equipment in a given space reduced motor activity; that there were some benefits to smaller classes; and that increased adult–child interactions came at the expense of child–child interactions, but provided more cognitive-linguistic stimulation.

AB  - Investigated how the introduction of a 3rd teacher influences the quality and quantity of staff/child interactions in kindergarten classrooms. It was predicted that addition of a 3rd teacher would increase the amount of interaction between children and teachers, increase positive interactive play between peers, and reduce negative interactive play between peers. Ss were 35 kindergartners (aged 3 yrs 2 mo to 4 yrs 5 mo) and 13 teachers from 8 kindergartens (4 that had introduced a 3rd teacher and 4 contrast centers). Data were collected from each classroom over 3 occasions in an 8-mo period. Results show that the introduction of a 3rd teacher was followed by an increase in the number of interactions that children had with teachers and in more prosocial play between peers. Most categories of child/teacher interactions (verbal, nonverbal, affective, play) increased from baseline to the 2nd and 3rd observations in 3-teacher kindergartens. Positive interactions with peers increased and negative interactions decreased after the arrival of the 3rd teacher. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - An evaluation was made on the effects of an improved staff ratio in New Zealand kindergartens. Aspects of four typical kindergartens staffed by two teachers were compared with aspects of four kindergartens that were provided with a third teacher. Data were collected from teachers, kindergarten children and parents. Findings indicated that the introduction of a third teacher was associated with a statistically significant reduction in children's negative behavior in relation to peers. Children had more positive play with peers, talked more, and interacted more with teachers after the third teacher arrived. After the third teacher was introduced, teacher behavior showed fewer changes than did child behavior, but teachers in the third-teacher kindergartens made more nonverbal initiations to children, talked more to parents, were more involved in children's play, and talked more to each other. Teachers believed that the introduction of a third teacher needed to be accompanied by considerable in-service work on leadership and management, and some findings lent credence to that belief. Adult-child ratios did not improve as much as expected in kindergartens with three teachers. It was concluded that the third teacher was a valuable addition, and that transition support should be provided. (RH)

AB  - The relationship of classroom-related variables to level of quality preschool for 4-year-olds in a multiethnic Southern California city was examined. The Early Childhood Environmental Rating Scale (ECERS; Harms & Clifford, 1980) was used to evaluate the quality of 26 preschool centers. Variables previously demonstrated to be good predictors of quality in nationwide studies were tested, including teacher to child ratio and group size. A novel variable, ethnic diversity, also was tested. Results did not support the hypotheses that smaller group size, higher teacher-to-child ratio, and greater ethnic diversity would be correlated with high quality centers. However, results did suggest that greater ethnic diversity was significantly negatively correlated with high quality in the 4-year-old classrooms.

AB  - Child care homes are the most common type of child care in the U.S. for very young children who receive regular non-parental care. Compared to center-based care, much less is known about relations between structural and process quality within this type of care. Further, professional associations have developed guidelines based on number and ages of the children in the child care home, but these have been empirically examined. We asked two questions in secondary analyses of two large studies of over 300 child care homes. First, we identified the structural dimensions that best predicted global quality. Regression analyses replicated the previously reported finding that caregiver training, but not ratio, was the structural characteristic that most consistently predicted observed global quality. Next, we compared observed quality of care in child care homes as a function of the professional association's guidelines regarding group size weighted by age of the children. No reliable association between quality of care and ratio guidelines was obtained. These findings suggest that parents and policy makers should rely more heavily on characteristics such as caregiver training or education than on group size or child:adult ratios as they make decisions about child care homes, at least...

AB  - Quality of care in child care centers & its relationship to receptive language skills are examined using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on a sample of 95 preschoolers. As hypothesized, quality of care (measured by group size & provider-child ratio), was not found to account for significant differences in preschoolers' cognitive abilities. However, a significant interaction was found to exist between quality of care, family income, & cognitive skills. In particular, preschoolers from low-income families were likely to have more favorable receptive language skills when placed in higher as compared to lower quality care, while no consistent relationship was found for children from other income groups. Family income & moderate hours of maternal work (1-39 as compared to no work or 40+ hours/week) were positively associated with preschoolers' language skills. 7 Tables, 1 Appendix, 42 References. AA

AB  - In 1989, the Nevada Legislature enacted the Class-Size Reduction (CSR) Act. The measure was designed to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio in the public schools, particularly in the earliest grades. The program was scheduled to proceed in several phases. The first step reduced the student-teacher ratio in selected kindergartens and first grade classes for 1990-1991 school years. The second step was designed to improve the second grade ratios; the 1991 Legislature made funds available for reducing the ratios to 16 to 1. The third grade phase was delayed until the 1996-97 fiscal year. Program costs are detailed, broken down by grade level, and the classroom configurations that have been employed are also described. Initial evaluation of the CSR program indicates that educators and parents were positive in their attitudes toward class-size reduction and that school districts reported fewer special education referrals. No exceptional results in achievement scores were reported. Subsequent studies of the program also produced mixed results, which it is believed reflect different teaching styles, maturity of students, and other factors. Special analysis of the program's impact on special-education referrals and grade retention are provided. (RJM)

AB  - This study examined characteristics of child care centers associated with preschoolers’ moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior while in child care (MVPA-C, SB-C), and attributes of outdoor play areas associated with the same behaviors during outdoor time (MVPA-O, SB-O). Participants were 89 children (3 -5 years) recruited from 10 child care centers in Brisbane, Australia. Children’s activity was measured by accelerometer over a 3-day period. Center characteristics and outdoor play area attributes were identified through survey and observation. We found that children were mostly sedentary while in child care. Lower child-staff ratios and using indoor play areas for motor activity were associated with more MVPA-C and less SB-C. Fixed play equipment in outdoor areas was conducive to more MVPA-O and less SB-O. This study suggests the possibility of enhancing preschoolers’ activity levels through changing these attributes. Further research with more centers from diverse settings is needed to test these findings.

The sample included 394 children (aged 3–5 yrs) from 32 child care centers. Results show that the profit child care centers had larger child groups than nonprofit child care centers, a lower adult to child ratio, and a positive staff attitude toward teaching goals. Age, gender, social background, and age span of the child care class were significant predictors of children's social and cognitive achievements. Adult-to-child ratio and teaching style did not prove to be good predictors of children's social or cognitive achievements. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - What is the developmental trajectory of the skills that underlie emergent literacy during the preschool years? Are there individual characteristics which predict whether a child will be at-risk for difficulties in acquiring literacy skills? Does a child’s experience in a high-quality early care and education environment enhance the development of his or her emergent literacy? The present study is an investigation of the individual and environmental factors relevant to children’s emergent literacy skills as they unfold in time. Using a combination of principal components analysis, growth modeling with a multi-level approach, and propensity score analysis, the trajectories of growth in emergent literacy were examined. In addition to child characteristics, the effects of early child environments on emergent literacy were also examined. The effects of home literacy environment and of high-quality early care and education environments were investigated using propensity score matching techniques. The growth in emergent literacy was examined using a nationally representative dataset, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study - Birth cohort (ECLS-B). Child characteristics, such as primary home language and poverty, were associated with lower initial abilities and suppressed growth in emergent literacy. A high-quality home literacy environment had a strong effect on the growth of children’s emergent abilities, even after controlling for child characteristics. High-quality early care and education environments, as defined by structural attributes of the program such as class size, had a modest impact on the growth of emergent literacy skills for some but not all children. When high-quality early education was defined in terms of teacher interaction, children who are exposed to such care experienced an increase in growth of their emergent literacy abilities. This study provides an examination of individual and group paths toward literacy as an element of school readiness, including the role of environment in the development of literacy skills. These findings have implications for early education policy, especially relevant to state-funded preschool programs and Early Head Start, to provide insight into contexts in which policy and the investment of resources can contribute most effectively to early literacy development.

AB  - This study examined prevalence, types, bully and victim characteristics, times and places bullying occur, relationship between class size and bullying, and relationship between teachers’ level of education and preschool bullying. Participants were a convenience sample of 246 Turkish preschool teachers working with children between 36 and 72 months. Preschool Peer Bullying Scale-Teacher Form was the main data collection instrument. Findings revealed that the most frequent bullying behaviours were rejecting a classmate joining in a game and hitting, slapping, punching, pinching or kicking a classmate. While preschool bullies were characterized as boys having behavioural problems, victims could be girls or boys obeying the rules. Bullying occurred when and where there was a lack of adult supervision, the number of boys increased the likelihood of early childhood bullying, and teachers having an undergraduate degree reported more bullying incidents. Implications are discussed for school counsellors and psychologists, researchers, as well as educational policy-makers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Manipulated numbers of children in 27 preschools to produce a low child–staff ratio (7.7:1), an average ratio (9.2:1), and a high ratio (11.2:1). Observations were carried out so that only 1 person (child or staff) was observed at any given time. Results showed a greater effect of ratio on individual child behavior than on individual staff behavior. Children annoyed and teased others more and were less absorbed in what they were doing under higher ratios. When the behavior of the whole group was considered, it was evident that (1) staff were confronted with a substantial increase in problematic child behaviors as the ratio went up (even by 2:1) and (2) the child's access to staff on an individual or tiny group basis was considerably reduced with the high ratios.

On probed and free recall comprehension tests, Ss who heard stories in the small-group setting performed significantly better than Ss who heard stories read one-to-one. One-to-one Ss in turn performed significantly better than Ss who heard stories read to the whole class. In addition, small group or one-to-one Ss generated significantly more comments and questions than whole-class Ss.

AB  - The article discusses the effect of the Early Learning Kindergarten (ELK) program on the physical activity of Kindergarten-aged children, particularly in Ontario. It cites the claim by former Ontario Minister of Education, Leona Dombrowsky, that full-day learning is part of the plan to make children have a strong start in school. Under the program, class size will increase to a maximum of 30 pupils and an Ontario Certified Teacher (OCT) and Early Childhood Educator (ECE) will teach them.

AB  - Class size has a long history of research. To date, there is high quality evidence from causal studies suggesting that smaller class size yields short and long‐term benefits for students. The understanding on how smaller class size achieve their benefits, i.e., the mechanisms, though, is less clear. Using data from the Head Start Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2009 cohort, I used propensity score techniques to investigate the effects of class size on behavioral outcomes for children who enrolled in Head Start for the first time in 2009, in full‐day classrooms with predominantly 4 and 5‐ year olds. I also studied the role of teacher‐student interactions in the classroom as a potential mediator of the above relationship. I found that smaller class sizes (17‐18 children per class) had a very small but non‐statistically significant effect (+0.10 S.D.) on student behavioral outcomes over comparison class sizes (19‐20 children per class). I also found a statistically significant effect of smaller class sizes on the quality of teacher-student interactions in the classroom (+0.33 S.D.). This effect was driven mainly by a sub‐component of the teacher‐student interaction scale, namely, classroom organization (+0.42 S.D.). The findings did not rule out the hypothesis that the quality of teacher‐student interactions in the classroom may be a potential mechanism by which smaller class size achieve their effects on students.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if selected state child care regulations impact school readiness as measured by children's cognitive test scores in reading, math, and general knowledge. Center based care has been shown to be beneficial for children's cognitive development (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network and Duncan, 2003). Every state assumes responsibility for regulating child care. Regulations vary widely regarding requirements for group size, ratios of children per staff member, teacher training, nutrition, health, safety, and space requirements. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study---Kindergarten (ECLS-K) (U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 2002), this study investigated the effects of state child care regulations on children's readiness for school. This study concluded that Individual state child care regulations impact school readiness as measured by the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study---Kindergarten Battery tests in reading, math, and general knowledge as children enter Kindergarten. Using data from the ECLS-K, this analysis suggests that children who reside in states with more stringent policies regarding staff-child ratios, group size, directors education level, directors hours in administration, directors early childhood hour requirement, teachers ongoing professional development hours, and requirements related to teachers obtaining an AA degree increases children's school readiness. Attending high quality centers in states with higher standards appears to impact children's reading, math and general knowledge scores as measured by the ECLS-K battery tests. Building more a comprehensive, high quality child care system requires implementation of the research. Individual states need to have a more efficient governance and management of the growing industry of child care. Investment of funds from the individual state governments is critical to the success of a comprehensive system. As states are developing more comprehensive systems, licensing regulations could be adapted accordingly. Local professional groups could assess licensing standards regularly to match them with current research. Overall, a partnership could be forged while developing a system of early care that includes a thorough analysis of existing structures and regulations.

AB  - Academic achievement has been the focal point in education for decades. In 2001, an Act of Congress was proposed to improve individual outcomes in education through evidenced based research using measurable goals, higher standards, and accountability. This federal legislation, known as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, mandates that all teachers be highly qualified by 2006 and that all students become proficient by the 2013/14 school year, specifically in the area of literacy. Consequently, kindergarten readiness has become an area of concern, thus placing preschool teachers under pressure to prepare children for school. The purpose of this study was to examine multiple factors that have been identified in the literature as impacting achievement in elementary and secondary education to ascertain their contribution toward literacy development in preschool children. Such factors included child (gender, race, home SES, attendance, behavior) and childcare site (teacher education, teacher experience, class size, site SES, class environment). Additionally, within-child protective factors were examined for their role in literacy development for children with and without challenging behaviors. To examine early literacy and behavior in preschool children, hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was conducted with literacy skills (expressive language and phonemic awareness) assessed at four points in time though the Individual Development and Growth Indicators (IGDI). A significant relationship was found between expressive language skills and race, attendance, classroom environment and class size. Phonemic awareness was significantly related to gender, home SES, and teacher education. Within-child protective factors positively impacted phonemic awareness skills for children in the non-challenging behavior group only. An in-depth description of the findings and limitations are discussed within this document. Overall, this study suggests that many of the factors impacting achievement in elementary and secondary education also impact literacy development in preschool children. These findings support the use of early intervention and preventative services for this population as a means to promote kindergarten readiness and future achievement.

AB  - Research Findings: Data from a national sample of Portuguese preschool centers were used to examine the relationship between age of start and number of hours in child care and levels of externalizing and prosocial behaviors with peers. Participants were both parents and teachers of 543 children (mean age = 4.5 years, 50.6% girls). Children started child care between 3 and 64 months and were attending child care 1-9 hr per day. The child care centers' classrooms had adult-child ratios between 5 and 8.7 and group sizes between 15 and 26 children. Externalizing and prosocial behavior with peers was assessed with the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation Scale-Short Form completed by the 3 adult informants. Control variables included family sociodemographics and education level, maternal parenting style assessed with the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, and maternal stress assessed with the Parenting Experiences questionnaire. Practice or Policy: Both the number of hours per week in child care and an earlier start of center-based child care had modest but significant associations with dimensional scores from teachers' reports of externalizing behavior but not with mothers' or fathers' reports, suggesting that externalizing behavior with peers could be regarded as context specific to peer relationships in group child care. There was no evidence that the quantity of exposure to child care per se could be a substantial risk factor for severe levels of externalizing behavior. Prosocial behavior with peers was not significantly associated with the number of hours in child care or with the age of entry into group child care.

AB  - The Early Childhood Observation Form was developed to compare and evaluate two distinct curriculums used in Title I and Title I Migrant Pre-Kindergarten classrooms in the Austin Independent School District during the 1979-1980 school year. Variables recorded on the form included language spoken, group size, activity, adult instructional involvement, instructional responsibility, adult contact, and curriculum used. Design of the form provided for day-long, minute-by-minute observations of randomly selected students on randomly selected observation days by two trained observers. The form was judged useful in examining a variety of curriculum approaches, assessing the extent to which a curriculum has been implemented, relating classroom practices to achievement gains, and/or contrasting curriculums. Findings from a total of 100 day-long observations were that Title I students received 22 minutes more instruction in a day which averaged 19 minutes longer, took more naptime (36% compared with 27%), spoke and heard less Spanish (1% compared with 11%), were part of larger groups (averaging 10 members, compared with 8), and received less instruction from teacher aides and more from teachers than Title I migrant students. Also included are background material on the form's development, directions and procedures for observers, statistical results, the Early Childhood Observation Form, a card file layout for computer analysis, and the computer program.

AB  - This interim report on the National Day Care Study (NDCS) presents preliminary findings of the 4-year research program designed to answer major policy questions about federal funding of center-based preschool day care. Major NDCS objectives have been to determine the impact of variations in staff-child ratio, group size, and staff size and qualifications on both the development of preschool children and the costs of center care. This document outlines the policy context within which the NDCS has been conducted, discusses its major objectives and overall design, and concludes with a presentation of preliminary findings and their implications, particularly the implications for Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements (FIDCR). The NCDS consists of a major cost-effects study, to which most of this report is devoted, and two substudies, from which findings are also included: an Infant Day Care Study (focusing on group care for children under 3 in 54 centers) and a Supply Study (a nationwide telephone survey of 3,100 centers). The major study has involved 1,800 children, 1,100 parents, caregivers in 120 classroom groups, and program and cost data gathered from 57 centers in Atlanta, Detroit and Seattle. (BF)

AB  - Objectives: Environmental characteristics within preschools that influence children’s motor competence are largely unknown. The purpose of the present study was to examine the contribution of various preschool environmental characteristics to children’s locomotor, object control, and total gross motor scores. Design: Cross-sectional, observational study of 3–5 year-old children (n = 229) from 22 preschools in South Carolina. Methods: The Children’s Activity and Movement in Preschool Study (CHAMPS) Motor Skills Protocol assessed MC. Preschool directors provided information regarding policies and practices. The research team measured playgrounds and classrooms, and the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised assessed preschool quality. Time spent in open space and electronic media use were also assessed using direct observation. The aforementioned variables predicted children’s object control, locomotor, and total gross motor scores. Results: Classroom size/child ratio, teacher education, playground size, electronic media use, and trips to outside organizations emerged as significant predictors of locomotor score and total motor score. The object control model was non-significant. Conclusions: Preschools may be able to promote motor competence by allowing children more time in open spaces, structured activity experiences, and by expanding existing outdoor playground space whenever possible.

AB  - Background. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the study protocol for the Learning Environments' Activity Potential for Preschoolers (LEAPP) study, the goal of which is to describe the activity levels of preschoolers attending various early learning venues and explore which attributes of these facilities (e.g. curriculum, policies, equipment, etc.) support activity participation. Design and Methods. This cross-sectional study aimed to recruit approximately 30 early learning environments requesting participation from preschoolers aged 2.5-5 years. Data collection included: Actical accelerometers (MiniMitter, Oregon, USA) to measure the activity levels of children for five consecutive days (15-second epoch length) while in care; the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation tool to explore the early learning environment's impact on activity; anthropometric data; the Child Temperament Questionnaire to assess the influence of preschoolers' temperament on physical activity; and demographic information from parents/guardians and early learning staff. ANOVA and linear regression analyses will be conducted to assess variances in activity levels among preschoolers attending different early learning types and to explore the impact of early learning environments on their activity levels. Independent sample t-tests will be used to examine differences in activity levels based on sex and weight status. Expected impact of the study for public health. This research will provide the first Canadian data to address environmental influences on preschoolers' activity levels in differing early learning environments. Additionally, this work will highlight the extent to which activity levels vary among preschoolers enrolled in full-day kindergarten, centre-, and home-based childcare.

AB  - Research Findings: This research examined preschoolers' exposure to 6 types of language stimulation techniques (LSTs) in classrooms serving at-risk children and considered whether specific activity contexts were associated with educators' rate of use of different LSTs. Several teacher-directed and child-directed activity contexts were videotaped in 14 classrooms. Adult utterances were coded for group size, activity context, and use of LSTs. A total of 5,017 utterances were analyzed. Descriptive analyses were used to determine frequency of LST use, and logistic regressions were used to predict the likelihood of LST use based on group size and activity context. About one third of adult utterances were classified as LSTs, and there was significant variation in educators' rate of use of LSTs. LSTs were more likely in small-group child-directed contexts than other contexts. Educators' use of child-dependent LSTs was relatively less frequent in relation to child-independent LSTs in teacher-directed contexts than in child-directed contexts. Practice or Policy: Results suggest that preschoolers attending at-risk classrooms are exposed to modest amounts of high-quality language, with some variability in exposure reflective of activity context and group size. These findings suggest the importance of professional development for educators to provide high-quality language learning environments within their classrooms.

AB  - This study deals with the relationship between the effectiveness of preschool centers and contextual factors, i.e. the way in which centers are organised and the family background of participating children. A comparison was made between the school achievements (more specifically, the literacy scores) of children that had participated in centers and a control group (N = 73 and N = 43, respectively). This comparison revealed effects on the total scores on an 'emergent literacy' observation form, and on teacher judgements of metalinguistic awareness and literacy orientation. Preschool teacher interviews were used to gather data on the 28 centers that had been visited by the children in the sample. Analyses showed a relationship between certain organisational features (especially adult-child ratio) and effectiveness of participation. Parent interviews were used to obtain information on children's family backgrounds. Analyses indicated a relationship between center effects and the extent to which immigrant children receive Dutch language input at home. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Phoneme awareness instruction plays a crucial role in reading acquisition for young children. While this early literacy topic has been studied for over 30 years, and cited by the National Reading Panel Report (2000) as an important area for further research, no reports to date explore the influence of instructional group size on phoneme awareness learning outcomes in children. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine the impact of Small Group Instruction (SGI) compared to Whole Class Instruction (WCI) on phoneme awareness outcomes from phoneme awareness with letter sound instruction provided to 66 kindergarten children from a low-income, urban district in upstate New York. ANOVA and ANCOVA results from this pretest posttest quasi-experimental study revealed significant learning across 10-weeks for both group sizes. However, no significant advantage was evident for SGI over WCI in phoneme awareness, letter knowledge, reading, or spelling. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of providing whole class phoneme awareness instruction as an alternative to traditional small group or one-to-one phoneme awareness instruction.

AB  - At 6 months of age, 576 infants were observed during 2 half-days in five types of nonmaternal child care (centers, child care homes, in-home sitters, grandparents, and fathers). Settings were assessed in terms of their structural characteristics (group size, child-adult ratio, physical environment) and caregivers' characteristics (formal education, specialized training, child care experience, and beliefs about child rearing). In addition, caregivers' interactions with infants were observed. Caregivers were rated as providing more positive caregiving when group sizes and child-adult ratios were smaller and when caregivers held less-authoritarian beliefs about child rearing. Significant differences were associated with type of care arrangement. Child-adult ratios and group sizes were largest in centers and smallest in informal in-home care (with fathers, grandparents, and in-home sitters); specialized training was highest in centers. Small group sizes, low child adult ratios, caregivers' nonauthoritarian child-rearing beliefs, and safe, clean, and stimulating physical environments were consistently associated with positive caregiving behaviors within each of these different types of settings.

AB  - Children's participation in the early childhood education context is a multidimensional issue and educators have a significant role in enhancing participation. In this paper, we focus on the existing challenges to children's participation and the ways that child care educators can work as teams to meet those challenges. The data were collected with a questionnaire from 1,114 child care teams working in the Helsinki metropolitan area. These teams consisted of almost 4,000 educators who took care of almost 20,000 children. Through ESEM factor analysis, the variables were organized into five factors: Adult-Child Ratios, Professional Skills; Managing Work; Work Practices and Special Needs. The team members felt they had a varying impact on the different challenges: highest on professional skills and managing work and lowest on Adult-Child Ratios. The results offer material for reflecting on practices in early childhood education especially when children's participation must be developed.

AB  - A cross-country comparison of children's cortisol levels at child care was performed in relation to their cortisol levels at home and the quality and quantity of child care they received. Participants were toddlers visiting child care centers in Spanish Basque Country (N = 60) and the Netherlands (N = 25) with substantial variation in structural child care quality (group sizes, childcaregiver ratios). Salivary cortisol was measured at mid-morning and mid-afternoon, both at child care and at home. Children's actual experiences in child care (global quality), as measured with the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale-Revised edition (ECERS-R), did not differ significantly across the two countries. Overall, children did not produce more cortisol at child care than at home. Results suggest that factors other than structural quality and quantity of care are responsible for cortisol diurnal changes. Global quality matters in explaining cortisol diurnal change in children visiting child care centers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents developments related to educational surveys in the U.S. Published earlier this month in the electronic journal "Education Policy Analysis Archives," a study is based on California's recent experiences at reducing class sizes to 20 or fewer students in kindergarten through the 3rd grade. Researchers from the RAND Corp., a Santa Monica, California-based think tank, examined the standardized-test scores over five years for pupils in 2,892 schools across the state. A new report examines the ways in which children from low-income families lag behind their more affluent peers academically, physically, and socially. There are strong indications that alcohol use contributes to school-related violence, but the problem gets too little attention from policymakers and administrators, concludes a recent study unveiled by the National Association of Secondary School Principals. A survey of more than 1,000 private schools has found that many would not participate in tuition-voucher programs if doing so would entail regulation of their curricula, decreased control over admissions, or a declining emphasis on religious instruction. The survey, conducted by the Cato Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates free-market principles, examines school voucher programs, and how private school administrators view them, following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2002 decision in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris.

AB  - The study examined the applicability and generalizability of the Classroom Assessment Scoring System Pre-K (CLASS Pre-K; Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008) and the associated conceptual Teaching through Interaction framework to understand classroom processes in the German early education system. Three broad domains describe effective teacher–child interactions: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support. In the present study, we observed teacher–child interactions in 63 classrooms drawn from 26 different preschools using the CLASS Pre-K. Consistent with research from the United States, CLASS Pre-K scores demonstrated that the quality of teacher–child interactions varied widely. Data indicated that the levels of Emotional Support and Classroom Organization were moderate. In contrast, the level of Instructional Support was rather low and even decreased over the course of the morning. Furthermore, Emotional Support was found to decrease over the day in classrooms with a higher child–teacher ratio. Results have important implications for policy and practice with regard to the quality of care and education in German preschools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper presents a follow-up study of the academic performance of children who had previously participated in one of eight experimental infant or preschool education projects. The initial phase of the study compared grade retention, special class placement and school dropout rates of the experimental program children with those of children in control classes. Results indicated lower rates of academic problems for all except one of the experimental programs. In an attempt to analyze which kinds of programs were the most effective, the second phase of the study correlated 25 variables intuitively related to program effectiveness with academic performance. These variables included length of program, size of groups, staff variables, and parent involvement among others. For this analysis, 21 individual programs sponsored by the eight projects were identified and analyzed. Results of this analysis indicated the most significant correlations between age of entrance into the experimental program, parental involvement, goals for parents, home visits, and adult/child ratio and placement in special education classes. It is suggested however, that more sensitive analysis and further research are necessary to clarify the exact nature of these relationships. (BD)

AB  - Hypothesized that the interaction between the arousal to action of environmental stimuli and recovery from that activity would generate biorhythms in the activity level of 16 kindergarten children. The level of environmental stimuli was manipulated by varying the play-group size and the apparatus; higher environmental complexity was expected to produce more pronounced rhythms. The heart rates of Ss playing in monad, dyad, and tetrad group sizes in 2 playroom configurations were monitored and spectral analysis was used to locate significant biorhythms. There was a tendency toward 40-min (slow frequency) and 15-min (fast frequency) biorhythms. The group size manipulation produced the strongest biorhythmic behavior in the dyadic groups. Apparatus differences were not significant, but the configuration containing a minimum quantity of play apparatus produced more variable activity than the configuration containing a large amount of play apparatus.

AB  - Studies of small-scale "model" early-childhood programs show that high-quality preschool can have transformative effects on human capital and economic outcomes. Evidence on the Head Start program is more mixed. Inputs and practices vary widely across Head Start centers, however, and little is known about variation in effectiveness within Head Start. This paper uses data from a multi-site randomized evaluation to quantify and explain variation in effectiveness across Head Start childcare centers. I answer two questions: (1) How much do short-run effects vary across Head Start centers? and (2) To what extent do inputs, practices, and child characteristics explain this variation? To answer the first question, I use a selection model with random coefficients to quantify heterogeneity in Head Start effects, accounting for non-compliance with experimental assignments. Estimates of the model show that the cross-center standard deviation of cognitive effects is 0.18 test score standard deviations, which is larger than typical estimates of variation in teacher or school effectiveness. Next, I assess the role of observed inputs, practices and child characteristics in generating this variation, focusing on inputs commonly cited as central to the success of model programs. My results show that Head Start centers offering full-day service boost cognitive skills more than other centers, while Head Start centers offering frequent home visiting are especially effective at raising non-cognitive skills. Head Start is also more effective for children with less-educated mothers. Centers that draw more children from center-based preschool have smaller effects, suggesting that cross-center differences in effects may be partially due to differences in counterfactual preschool options. Other key inputs, including the High/Scope curriculum, teacher education, and class size, are not associated with increased effectiveness in Head Start. Together, observed inputs explain about one-third of the variation in Head Start effectiveness across experimental sites.

AB  - The purpose of this study conducted in 36 infant-toddler centres ("Kinderkrippen") in the city of Munich in Bavaria/Germany was to explore structural characteristics of early child care and education and their effects on child care quality. Stepwise regressions and variance analysis (Manova) examined the relation between quality of care and structural characteristics such as group size, staff competence and preparation time. A multi-respondent approach was employed, including self-report questionnaires of educators ("Erzieherinnen") as well as data on local working conditions collected from the directors of the centres. The findings of this study suggest that different sets of variables can be used to predict quality of education for under-threes. The practitioners' reported quality of education was found to relate to higher competence (with regard to centre programme, documentation, teamwork and staff qualification), better orientation towards the children's needs and better working atmosphere. Furthermore there were multivariate effects of the availability of and networking with external specialists, preparation time, and grouping arrangements within the centre such as changing from a home-group approach to an open-group setting. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for research and the basic impact of education in early childhood. (Contains 4 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - To determine the effects of multiple vs individual caregiving, a day-care center was divided into 2 sections with the 20 6 wk–24 mo old infants in one section being assigned to an individual caregiver (1 caregiver for every 4 infants) and those in the other section being assigned multiple caregivers (5 caregivers for all 20 infants). Observations of social contacts and separations from and reunions with mothers were conducted, developmental testing (Bayley Scales of Infant Development) was performed, and attendance and turnover records were monitored. The majority of measures showed no differences between the 2 systems of care. Results indicate that the quality of care that a child receives depends more heavily on such factors as staff training and turnover, group size, and total number of caregivers, than on the single factor of method of assigning children to caregivers.

AB  - Reports data from a multisite study of typical center-based child care and children's development regarding (a) associations among quality of care defined by structural features, process indicators, and compliance with state regulations, (b) variation in quality based on the stringency of state child care regulations and center compliance, and (c) specific quality indicators that show especially strong links to children's experiences in child care. Data were collected during a single full-day visit to each of 104 nonsectarian childcare centers from 3 sites: Boston, Massachusetts; the central area of Virginia; and Atlanta, Georgia. Findings confirmed prior evidence regarding the importance of ratios, teacher training, and group size for high quality classroom processes, but demonstrated the more significant contribution of teacher wages and parent fees. Both structural and process measures of quality varied with the location of the center in a state with more or less stringent child care regulations. The results indicate the importance of incorporating economic and regulatory considerations into future studies of childcare quality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examines the impact of story exposure, instructional group size, and pre-kindergarten experience on children's story comprehension and receptive vocabulary skills. Young children lacking in emergent literacy development often enter school at a disadvantage to their peers. Educational institutions traditionally have assumed that most children are exposed early on to the practice of storybook reading. However, for many low-income, urban African-American children exposure to and preparation for literacy development does not occur. This negative learning context has led to a shift in emphasis from the home to the school for the task of effectively reinforcing pre-literacy development. Research on pre-literacy development strategies has found that children who were either placed into small reading groups or repeatedly exposed to the same story have shown improvements in their emergent literacy skills. However, research documenting the correlation between these variables has been limited. The sample for the study of these variables consisted of seventy-four African-American children from two low-income, inner-city public schools, located in the North Eastern region of the United States. The children attended schools considered by the school district to be 'at risk for school failure' and 'educationally disadvantaged' due to a history of low standardized test scores. Prior to and following the treatment phase, the Durrell Listening Comprehension Test and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised were administered. Analysis of covariance and multiple regression were utilized to assess mean differences and relationships between the three independent variables and the two dependent variables. Results of the statistical analyses show children with pre-kindergarten program experience to have significantly higher outcomes for both story comprehension and receptive vocabulary. Multiple story exposure and larger instructional groups also showed significantly higher means for receptive vocabulary. Reading group size and pre-kindergarten experience were found to have significant predictive relationships to receptive vocabulary while pre-kindergarten experience was also significantly predictive of story comprehension. Recommended steps for improving early literacy development include the following: Expanded teacher training, additional storybook resources to libraries and classrooms, multiple child instructional groups, increased government funding, and expanded pre-kindergarten programs. Additional study of the impact of these variables on children's emergent literacy development is recommended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between non-parental care and toddlers' behavioral outcomes using data from Australia. In particular, we explore heterogeneity in the relationship using the unique data on quality attributes: carer/child ratio, share of qualified staff, and expert ratings. The results suggest that full-time non-parental care, particularly center care, is negatively associated with toddlers' behavioral outcomes. The negative association is however mitigated when centers have a larger number of carers per child. The negative association between non-parental care and behavioral outcomes also appears to be larger for children with better-educated parents. (Contains 12 tables.)

AB  - A revised model or service delivery for early intervention or day-care services for preschoolers was examined. Setting Factors (i.e., educational and occupational prestige of parents, housing arrangements, family composition), Client Factors (i.e., children's developmental functioning, adaptive behaviours, motivation, overall preschool behaviour), Process Factors (i.e., length and intensity of service delivery, staff-to-child ratios, number of services received) and Outcome Factors (i.e., short-term changes in client functioning) were measured. Fifty-one intervention children comprising an archival data base were used in Study 1. A different group of 37 day-care and 31 intervention children participated in Study 2. Results indicated that both intervention and day-care children showed significant changes in specific areas of development over time which could be attributed to the provision of services. Family demographics and community variables were not significant predictors of children's functioning at the start of the service delivery period (i.e., Time One assessment). Children's functioning at the start of the service delivery period significantly predicted their functioning at the end of the service delivery period. The parameters of service delivery did not play a moderating role in the prediction of functioning at the end of the service delivery period. Issues relevant to the measurement of service delivery variables are highlighted. Theoretical implications regarding stability and continuity of development are discussed, as is the need for guidelines to help predict what combinations of services will have the greatest impact with specific types of children.

The relation between group functioning and structural group characteristics was also examined. Mean age and group continuity (i.e., how long the children have already been attending the group) predicted group functioning, with higher group functioning in groups with older children and in groups with greater continuity. Group size and group constancy (i.e., how many days a week children attend the child care group together) did not independently contribute to the prediction of the group functioning variables.

AB  - Comparative assessment of the physical growth and development of preschool children attending groups of different occupancy rate: 20 and 30 children per group was carried out. It was established that children of high occupancy rate groups had more frequent physical growth and development disorders - weight deficit, low annual weight growth, retardation of physiologic growth according to developmental norm, thoracic development dyspoiesis, body build disbalance, biological adulthood slowdown. Positive relation of physical disorders of the children and the occupancy rate of the groups of pre-school educational institution was found. Risk ratio of the delay of physical growth norms for the children from overcrowded groups is F5-2.2 times higher in comparison to their agemates from groups consisting of 20 persons. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Проведен сравнительный анализ показателей физического развития детей, посещающих дошкольные образовательные организации с различной наполняемостью групп. Установлено, что у детей, посещающих высоко комплектные группы, чаще регистрируются нарушения показателей физического развития - дефицит массы тела, низкие значения ежегодной прибавки веса, отставание в росте от физиологической возрастной нормы, дисгармоничность телосложения, снижение параметров развития грудной клетки и темпов биологической зрелости. Относительный риск отставания параметров физического развития от физиологической нормы у детей, посещающих группы с повышенной комплектацией в 1.5-2.2 раза выше, чем у их сверстников, посещающих группы с наполнением 20 человек. Выявлена достоверная зависимость формирования нарушений физического развития у детей от степени наполняемости групп ДОО. (Russian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Bulletin of Perm University.

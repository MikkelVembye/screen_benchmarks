AB  - This study explores how group size influences children’s conditions for wellbeing, learning and development in preschool in relation to the intentions in the revised (2010) Swedish preschool curriculum. The study is based on qualitative methods generated from interviews and open-ended questions in a questionnaire. Group size is dependent on three dimensions of preschool teacher’s experiences of group size, constituted of various aspects: preschool teacher qualifications and competence, physical indoor and outdoor environment and the composition of the child group. The dimensions and aspects affect the critical number of children for it to function in a qualitative good manner. If these dimensions and aspects do not interact constructively, teachers and children experience the group as large. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study observed the extent to which teachers supported the inclusion of children with disabilities into mainstream classrooms and involved monitoring 52 mainstream preschool settings in Greece. The association between programme quality, context and teacher characteristics was also tested. Findings showed that the quality of inclusion ranged from "low" to "minimal," with teachers more frequently implementing practices that only partially promoted participation for children with disabilities in academic and social classroom activities. The analysis also revealed that the quality of programming was not influenced by the model of special education provision, the group size, the number of children with disabilities, the training teachers had in special education or their teaching experience. The results are discussed both at a national and international level, revealing areas that need further examination into preschool inclusion quality.

AB  - Little is known about the quality and characteristics of the language used by childcare staff when interacting with infants in non-parental group care settings. This qualitative study analysed the manner in which staff used language when interacting with ten children aged between 9 and 20 months in four different long day care centres in Sydney, Australia. Each infant was audiorecorded for one whole day using a small recording device attached to her/his clothing, which captured all the language spoken directly to, or in their presence of, the infant. The infants and staff were simultaneously videorecorded as they went about their everyday activities, to provide additional contextual information. Using systemic functional linguistics as the theoretical underpinning, the study found that staff members tended to talk to more than one child at a time, limiting their potential to engage in the types of sustained conversations with individual children that have been shown to promote language development. Staff also tended to use language primarily to manage children's behaviour and provide physical care, rather than using language to encourage children to use their own developing language to represent their experiences in a variety of contexts. The findings have implications for group size, early childhood teacher education and inservice professional development.

AB  - I use examples from my ethnographic work on early childhood education and care settings in Japan and France to demonstrate that quality standards are cultural constructs and to question the universality of such core U.S. standards of quality in ECEC as low student-teacher ratios and multicultural curricula. My argument is that quality standards should reflect local values and concerns and not be imposed across cultural divides. In a heterogeneous society such as the U.S., notions of quality should arise out of conversations in local communities among early childhood educators and parents.

AB  - Data from an Israeli project shows higher proportion of insecurely attached infants in center care as compared with noncenter care (Sagi, Koren-Karie, Gini, Ziv, & Joels, 2002). The present study was designed to assess structural and emotional aspects characterizing infants' experiences in center care, aiming to explain, in part, the high incidence of attachment insecurity among center-care infants. In the present study, we focus on 151 center-care infants who were observed in the Ainsworth Strange Situation (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) with their mothers. Sixty-one percent of them were coded as securely attached to their mothers while 39% were coded as insecurely attached. In addition, 56 directors and 120 caregivers in 56 centers were videotaped throughout a full-day observation. The Assessment Profile of Early Childhood Program (Abbott-Shim & Sibley, 1987) was also employed. Results indicated that the centers in Israel are of low standards: Large group size, high caregiver–infants ratio, inadequate professional training, and minimal attention to individual emotional needs. No associations were found between infants' attachment and various aspects of the settings. The low quality of the Israeli settings may explain the higher rate of attachment insecurity in center-care infants. ©2005 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.

AB  - Described 25 early childhood teachers' behaviors when they became involved in children's naturally occurring peer interactions in the context of free choice activities. Relationships of these teacher interventions to adult/child classroom ratio, teacher education, teacher beliefs, and program quality were also examined. Results indicate that teachers became involved in an average of 5.5 peer interaction episodes in each 30-min observation period. The most commonly observed interventions were statements of rules and commands, and interventions in which the teacher terminated a peer interaction. Overall program quality, high adult/child ratio, teachers' beliefs about developmentally appropriate practice, and teachers' level of education were related positively to a variety of interventions having the potential to help children become autonomous in negotiating successful peer interaction. Greater specialized preparation in early childhood education was associated with more frequent intervention in peer interactions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study focused on small and large class sizes and the impact these classes had on four teachers’ self-efficacy during the 2011-2012 school year, and was conducted in a suburban elementary school. The study was qualitative and used triangulation of data sources to determine whether teachers had high or low efficacy levels, depending on their small or large class sizes. Two of the teacher participants were kindergarten teachers teaching small class sizes (nineteen to twenty students each), and two of the teacher participants were first grade teachers teaching large class sizes (twenty-four students each). All four teacher participants were female with experience teaching both small and large class sizes in their past years of classroom teaching. This study used data collected from interviews, observations, and journal entries of each of the four teacher participants. Common to all four teacher participants, twelve important trends emerged from the data collected. The participants’ data were compared and categorized according to positive or negative thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and actions in each trend. After comparing all four teacher participants’ data and identifying their statements, actions, and writing as positive or negative, it was determined that both teacher participants in the small class sizes displayed high (positive) teacher efficacy levels, and both teacher participants in the large class sizes displayed low (negative) teacher efficacy levels. The results of this study target the importance of school administrators to create teacher in-service workshops focusing on strategies to help teachers who teach large size classes. Learning and practicing efficient ways to implement curriculum, conduct assessments, effectively teach small groups, manage behavior, and utilize teacher assistants and parent volunteers would be helpful strategies for school administrators to offer to teachers prior to the year’s beginning. Extending teachers intensive training on how to manage large class sizes may help with teacher retention, as teachers may have more self-confidence, feel better about their teaching, and display successful and positive attitudes towards their students which may encourage them to continue teaching in the classroom and continue in the education field in general.

AB  - 37 daycare parents (mean age 30 yrs) were interviewed by phone about important aspects of their child's daycare center. Information about the daycare centers' structural and procedural characteristics was obtained through interviews with center directors. Comparisons between parental answers and the data provided by the directors revealed significant gaps in parental knowledge of daycare. On average, parents answered only 45% of questions correctly, and reported a lack of knowledge regarding both general center characteristics (i.e., turnover rates, caregiver training, and hiring practices) and specific group characteristics (i.e., group size, adult-child ratio, and child's daily schedule). Parental knowledge increased with length of involvement with the center, but other variables such as parent education and the number of hours the child spent in care per week did not contribute to prediction of parental knowledge.

AB  - Background: There is a limited amount of research about group size in preschool, and how it impacts on teachers’ working conditions and their ability to support children’s learning and knowledge development in line with curriculum intentions. Purpose: From a perspective on quality, this article examines the organisational conditions for children’s learning in preschool in relation to group size. The questions at issue are: how do teachers explain how they organise the child group and the learning environment in preschool, and why? Sample: The sample consists of 12 preschools from different parts of Sweden. The preschools selected for the study are stratified in order to represent small and large group sizes in Swedish preschools as defined by the Swedish National Agency for Education. The sample contains both urban and rural regions and represents districts that differ geographically, demographically, ethnically, and which include varied socioeconomic structures. The 12 preschools had children in three age groupings: 1–3, 3–5 or 1–5. The number of children in the participating preschools ranged from 12 children to 45 children, with seven of the preschools having more than 30 children in their groups. Design and method: The article is based on interactionist perspectives, Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, a critical ecology of the early childhood profession, theories of children’s learning, and four dimensions of pedagogical quality. Together, these theoretical perspectives contribute to an understanding of the relationships between policy issues, educational goals, group size and teachers’ competence in organising and creating conditions for children’s learning. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two teachers from each of the 12 preschools. The interviews lasted between 40–60 minutes and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The analytical process was conducted in three steps and can be described as an analytical process of abduction. The four dimensions of pedagogical quality were used as analytical lenses to discern and understand critical aspects related to the teachers’ understanding of group size. Result:Irrespective of group size, most of the children participate in different group constellations throughout the day, some organised by the teachers and some by the children themselves. Teachers’ competence to organise the children in such ways that good conditions for learning were created, differed between preschools, and depended on the teachers’ approach, which can be described as either intentional or unintentional learning. Conclusion:Teachers’ organisational approaches influence the quality of the preschool and conditions for children’s learning in distinct ways.

AB  - Searching for quality in day-care institutions, context factors soon appear as being most important; the staff must be qualified, teachers must be well trained, and the child-adult ratio must be in order. The large EPPE project is presented, and its results indicate the importance of: sustained common attention betw. children and teachers, a mixture of child and adult initiatives, knowledge abt. the development and learning of children, parent involvement, and conflicts solved by discussions. In Denmark we should also focus on efforts to include immigrant children and Danish children with weak backgrounds. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined kindergarten teachers' perceptions of the impact of changes in group-size policy on 3- and 4-year-old children in New Zealand's Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association. Data were collected through a series of interviews of Wellington kindergarten teachers from 54 kindergartens and focused mainly on the perceived effects of changing group size with regard to parent-teacher relationships, staff and child turnover, and adult-child ratios. The findings show that the changed policy had had a direct impact on children, programmers, teachers, and families. The major issues presented by the teachers are as follows: (1) they had less time to work with individual children and small groups; (2) even though the adult-child ratio remained constant at 1:15, the larger group size had a marked impact on the type of activities teachers were able to offer; (3) teachers were being forced toward a supervisory role; (4) increased roll numbers had an adverse, diluting effect on teachers' relationships with parents; (5) in some kindergartens children were being admitted at a younger age, which placed extra demands on teachers; and (6) there had been little training or support for teachers to cope with the consequences of the new policy. (Two appendices include the kindergarten group size project questionnaire and the interview schedule. Contains 44 references.) (AP)

AB  - This paper on day care services presents: (1) an examination of aspects of home care for children which characterize it as a behavior setting independent of the mother-child bond; (2) a comparison of these home aspects with several common types of day care; and (3) an evaluation of current day care types based on similarities to a good home. Research methodology is not included, but subjects chosen for observation included 14 children in 14 family day care homes, 84 children attending 14 group care centers, and 14 children who attended nursery school part-time and were cared for individually in 14 private homes and also attended nursery school part-time. Differences among types of day care are discussed. Other topics include: (1) child-initiated and teacher-initiated activities, (2) adult-child ratio during activities, (3) number and kinds of people in the setting, (4) kinds of adult input and (5) the physical setting. A final section discusses the logic of behavior settings and the home as a workable model for day care. (SDH)

AB  - In Sweden, preschool has been noted as being of a high quality compared to many other countries. However, dramatic changes in the preschool sector are taking place. A recent law states that it is a child's right to get a preschool place within a few months. As a consequence, the number of children in preschool has increased, which could influence group sizes since there is no state regulation of the number of children in a group. This article based on the project "The impact of group size on children's affordances in preschool" aims to describe and analyse preschool teachers' ideas of what an ideal preschool group is. It is a qualitative study based on a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions, answered by preschool teachers. The results show that preschool teachers define a well-functioning group as having a balance between gender, age and ethnicity. The preschool teachers stress that they prefer a group with fewer children than they have today. A key aspect of having a well-functioning group is also the preschool teachers' competence and the preschool environment. Preschool teachers' ideas of what constitute an ideal group of children may contribute to why they perceive the group size too large.

AB  - This book describes the results of film study of every day events in day care. It focuses on teacher and child behavior as they interact at meals, naps, and play, and proposes that minute examination of what actually happens to children in specific situations is necessary to identify the kinds of positive behaviors caregivers want to build on, as well as to help them identify the negative behaviors they need to avoid in children's day care experience. Following a brief introduction to changing demand for group child care, chapter 1 provides a rationale for the use of film in this exploration and outlines the chapters in the book. Chapter 2 then lays out the background and structure of the day care environment, covering topics such as space, curriculum, time, and routines. Chapter 3 discusses the abilities of young children to control themselves, learning through rhythm, repetition, and imitation. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the ways in which communication is learned in the early years, discussing topics such as hair pulling, biting, and crying. The sixth chapter examines the variety of adult values that are transmitted by interactions between teachers and children in day care by comparing a suburban center and an urban center. Chapter 7 provides an infant-toddler teacher's perspective with a description of the teacher's understanding of what constitutes good care and her feelings about her work. Chapter 8 is a general discussion of how children learn, and covers cognitive, social, and emotional learning. Contains 32 references. (TJQ)

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the current state of pre-kindergarten classrooms in the state of Indiana through the perspectives of public and private pre-kindergarten program directors. Survey results revealed a high concentration of female pre-kindergarten directors within the state of Indiana. Although directors rated their teaching staffs with a high level of early education background, they themselves felt less confident about their backgrounds in this field. Descriptive data also revealed that private student-teacher ratios are smaller, their instructional days are longer, their programs have been established for longer periods of time, and their directors have had longer tenures than their public counterparts. Statistical testing found that directors of public urban schools reported a higher quality rating than suburban and rural pre-kindergarten programs, based on the quality composite score. It was determined that student-teacher ratio and school type ("public, private") both served as significant predictors of the quality composite score. It was revealed that as student-teacher ratio increases, the perceived pre-kindergarten quality decreases. Results also showed that pre-kindergarten directors' perceived quality is less within the private setting than in the public setting, based on the composite quality score. The overarching purpose of this study was to provide an awareness of the potential benefits that "quality" pre-kindergarten programming could yield for the future citizens of Indiana as a whole and if perceived quality exists to some degree.

AB  - 20 fathers and 23 mothers (mean age 26.2 yrs) of infants who had enrolled in a daycare center were asked to evaluate their daycare experience as well as their children's current developmental status. In general, parent evaluations provided strong support for daycare as an effective means of supplementary infant care. When dissatisfaction with daycare was expressed, it focused on matters pertaining to infant health, physical resources of the center, parent involvement in center activities, and caregiver–infant ratios. Parents perceived their children to be advanced in competence skills relative to their peers. With few exceptions, parents viewed group daycare as the most desirable type of supplementary infant care, but only if high-quality staff and programs could be assured.

AB  - Examined the effect of child–caregiver ratio on social interaction and activity pattern in day-care centers. Two employees were observed in a day care center during 2 periods. There were 18 children (aged 1–12 yrs) in each time period; however, in the 1st period there were 4 staff members available, and in the 2nd period there were 3 staff members. An analysis of 711 observed intervals from the 1st period compared with 652 intervals from the 2nd period showed that the decreased ratio of children per caregiver was used in such a way that the staff reduced the amount of time spent alone with the children and instead worked as 2–3 caregivers together. In general, more staff in the unit was associated with a larger proportion of educational activities and a smaller proportion of basic care activities.

AB  - Observed the social interactions and activities of 20 caregivers from 6 day-care centers. Staff interview data and parent-completed questionnaire data were also gathered. Variations in observed patterns of activities and social interactions could not be explained only by referring to variations in child/staff ratio. More adults per child increased child-oriented activities and close interaction with the children only if the staff agreed on goals and methods in their work. Results agree with the view that the roles of, activities of, and relationships between teachers, children, and parents are influenced by the manner in which each person defines and experiences the ratio of adults to children in the day-care center. A model is presented in which child–caregiver ratio is related to group characteristics, adult working styles, and concordance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many young children spend a significant amount of time each day in preschool settings. It is important to understand how teachers create and maximize opportunities for children’s social and emotional learning (SEL) in the classrooms. This research was conducted in Singapore and explores how SEL is supported by teachers in areas identified in the national curriculum (self-awareness and positive self-concept, self-management, social awareness, relationship management, and responsible decision-making). The qualitative analyses draw on observations across six preschool classrooms. There were 32 instances identified in which teachers provided support for SEL across three aspects of interactional situations: group size, type of activity, and type of teaching opportunity. More opportunities for SEL were afforded in small group versus whole group activities and more often in outdoor play and planned lesson times than when children were in learning centers, at mealtimes, or making transitions between activities. Intentional teaching also afforded more opportunities for SEL as compared to incidental teaching. Teachers adopted a variety of verbal and non-verbal strategies to support SEL that included setting a positive tone, suggesting solutions, allocating tasks, and extending on responses. This research provides knowledge about how, and in what interactional situations, teachers demonstrate SEL support to individuals and groups of children in kindergarten classrooms.

AB  - This study looked at the factors Latina mothers want to see in their children's preschool centers, in order to provide a more holistic approach for defining high-quality preschools. A qualitative study was conducted in which 40 Latina mothers from a western region of the United States were interviewed to understand their views about quality preschools and what they look for when selecting a placement for their child or children. The data were analyzed using a Funds of Knowledge framework. Overall, the mothers first chose a preschool based on suggestions from their social networks, proximity, and affordability. Then, the mothers looked for centers that were safe, had trusting and loving staff, welcomed families, had a curriculum they desired, and a low student-teacher ratio. The analysis found that the mothers' preferences for their children's preschool stemmed from their past and present experiences. This study calls for a redefinition of quality that emphasizes the importance of valuing parents' culture, context, and unique desires for their children. In understanding the factors that families look for in their children's preschool, practitioners can better incorporate these factors and, in doing so, value families.

AB  - This paper addresses, in two parts, some issues in the staffing of early childhood services. Taking an international perspective, the first part of the paper discusses: (1) the structure of the early childhood workforce; (2) the social construction of the early childhood worker; (3) gender; (4) staff to child ratios; (5) processes of transition in the reform of staffing; (6) the relationship between the staffing of early childhood services and other services for children; and (7) family day care. This part concludes with a series of questions about the staffing of early childhood services, especially concerning training and education, and presents, as a basis for discussion, a set of targets for staffing drawn from a larger set of 40 "quality targets" produced by the European Commission Childcare Network, an expert group drawn from the European Union's member states. The second part of the paper consists of accounts of staffing in center-based early childhood services in six case countries. This part provides detailed material to illustrate the general points made in part one. The six countries selected for special attention are Denmark, France, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. They were selected because they illustrate most of the range of diversity outlined in part one, with the exception that five of the six have integrated responsibility for all early childhood services within one system and government department, while most countries continue to divide responsibility between education and welfare systems.

AB  - To investigate the current status of group time in early childhood centers, a small-scale exploratory study was designed and executed. Results of interviews with 35 teachers and observations in five classrooms serving children ages 2 1/2 through kindergarten revealed that all classrooms had at least one group time or circle time, usually in the morning. Of 14 broad categories of resources noted by teachers, books and stories, and music and songs were most frequently mentioned; poetry, nursery rhymes, and relaxation activities were least frequently mentioned. Teachers' written plans and observations revealed the actual use of a much narrower range of activities. Immediate concerns, such as "themes" and children's interests and needs, were primary determinants of what teachers did. Detailed written plans were seldom made. Teachers reported that their major problems involved disturbances of group time by students and balancing the needs of the individual child with those of the group. Teachers ascribed such problems to factors beyond their control; these included children's developmental level, home backgound, and group size. Observation revealed much inattention during group time, with teachers using relatively few techniques for monitoring, maintaining, and guiding children's attention and behavior. Implications for teacher educators, administrators, and teachers are discussed. Teachers are urged to take an active classroom leadership role by: (1) planning more systematically; (2) using group time to introduce new ideas and skills and develop positive attitudes and behavior; (3) expand their repertoire of materials and activities; (4) enlarge their techniques of monitoring and guiding behavior; and (5) coaching other adults in the classroom how to behave during group time. Measures used are appended. (Author/RH)

AB  - This exploratory netnographic study describes how a sample of Ontario kindergarten teachers perceive the new Ontario Full Day Kindergarten (FDK) curriculum. Discussions from teacher message boards, the comment sections of online news articles, and interviews with kindergarten teachers were analyzed and coded using a qualitative approach. Analysis revealed three major themes: 1) Class size concerns, 2) Team teaching concerns, and 3) Play-based curriculum concerns. Results are in broad agreement with those reported in existing research into Ontario's FDK initiative. Findings highlight the need for further research with educators involved in Ontario's FDK and also contribute to the burgeoning field of netnography research. Suggestions for future research and practice are included.

AB  - Since the beginning of the 1970s, quality early childhood education and care (preschool) has been a national priority in Sweden. Over the years, policy changes such as the marketisation of the welfare system with increased state regulation and a focus on cost-effectiveness and performativity have resulted in modifications to the services offered. Because of its potential impact on children's learning, wellbeing and development, the preschool environment--as reflected in its spatial design and pedagogical organisation--is considered an important quality indicator. Since the late 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, there has been a tendency towards flexible organisation, with 40-50 young children and a team of 6-8 staff members working together and sharing educational spaces. Taking these reforms as the point of departure, this article examines the rationale for the policy changes and considers their implications for children, teachers and the quality of the preschool education. Data sources include policy documents as well as contemporary research. Findings indicate that policy reforms with shifting pedagogical organisation seem to be proposed and introduced without robust research evidence of the implications for children and teachers.

AB  - This study describes the social contexts in which four-year-olds undertake practitioner-assigned cognitive/learning tasks within preschools and the different experiences these contexts provide for children. Data was collected in 34 preschool settings in South East England, using a phenomenographic mapping of activities and social groupings during learning activities. The data was subject to frequency-based analyses. Results identified distinct social pedagogic contexts wherein children interacted with practitioners or with peers; these contexts were differentiated by group size and composition, activity, type of interaction with practitioner and peers, level of cognitive challenge and genderisation of activity. The results revealed that while children engaged in cognitive/learning activities within both practitioner- and child-oriented pedagogic worlds the nature of the activities within these social contexts emphasised interactive inclusion and interactive exclusion respectively.

AB  - This dissertation provides a case study of the daily experiences of children and teachers in a nonprofit day care center. Located in a middle class suburb of a midwestern metropolitan area, the center serves 54 three- and four-year-olds of varied economic and racial background (20% of the children are black; family incomes range from below $8,000 to $40,000 per annum). Focusing on the orientation of four day care teachers toward children's individual and social experiences, the discussion gives specific attention to teachers' arrangement of environments, teachers' interactions with each other, and children's actions that teachers allow or encourage. It is argued that day care centers in their daily operations actually emphasize individual more than social or collectivist values and experiences. Chapter One describes the conceptualization of the research problem, the origin of the study, and the rationale for implementing the study. Chapters Two, Three, and Four depict at a micro-level how four day care teachers' actions tend to emphasize individual experiences more than social experiences. Chapter Five examines the broader structural context of this field study in order to reflect on how the research findings relate to America's tradition of individualism. Chapter Six concludes by focusing on implications for day care practice that might help promote a balance between individual and social learning for young children. Related materials are appended.

AB  - Children have the right to fulfill and expand on all their potentials and desires to learn. In 2010, the Ontario Ministry of Education introduced Full-Day Kindergarten (FDK) in Ontario and aimed at providing quality Kindergarten programs for children. FDK is expected to be implemented in all Ontario public schools by 2015/16. The literature and research (McCain, M.N. & Mustard, J.F., 1999; McCain et al., 2007; McCain et al., 2011) on early years education affirms that children benefit from quality early years educational programs as they are important in developing neurons in the brain before the age of six. This qualitative study focuses on understanding early years educational philosophies, and examining teachers' perspectives on FDK teaching and learning practices. The case studies are informed by the narratives of eight Kindergarten teachers through data collected from interviews, observations, classroom visits, and artifacts. The most significant findings of the study are that quality FDK teaching and learning practices are based on the following features: (a) learning through play-based, inquiry-based and experiential-based exploration; (b) making the educational experiences child-centred and authentic; (c) building on children's past experiences, nurturing self-expression and identity; (d) strengthening relationships and connections; and (e) creating stimulating environments, both indoor and outdoor, for children's learning and development. Teachers' perspectives and specific practices are described, analyzed, and discussed. Theory informed practice and practice informed theory, as models were developed and designed during this research journey. The theoretical framework served as a lens and was instrumental in examining FDK practices in each case study. The Integrated Child Development Model was created, later modified, and named the Early Years Education Model (EYE Model). The EYE Model, focused on integrated and comprehensive child development, identified important aspects of quality FDK and named developmental domains. The model served as a tool and conceptual framework in evaluating and analyzing classroom practice. Research implications that resulted from this study included improving class size and providing more teacher training. Greater opportunities for quality and varied play experiences were identified as being essential moving forward. The Kindergarten years lay a strong foundation for success in future schooling, and looking closely at teaching and learning practices in the classroom brings awareness to best practices.

AB  - This paper offers a summary analysis of 4 years of interviews with 1,003 kindergarten and first through third grade teachers regarding their experience in teaching either a small class, a regular size class, or a regular size class with a full-time teacher's aide. The paper uses teachers' descriptions of their experience to explore the effect of reduced class size or reduced teacher/pupil ratio on developmental appropriateness of primary grade curriculum and on adult-child interaction. Current class size research is briefly sketched. The paucity of findings regarding classroom processes is noted. Next, Project STAR, a 4-year longitudinal study of effects of reduced class size and teacher/pupil ratio in kindergarten through third grades is described. Results of the teacher interviews are summarized and discussed in relation to the National Association for the Education of Young Children's position statements on developmentally appropriate practice in the primary grades. It is concluded that small classes of about 15 students and regular size classes of about 25 students and a full-time aide contribute to a primary grade experience that is more congruent with the developmental and learning needs of students than is the experience of proportionally larger classes.

AB  - Difficulty with social competence is a core deficit of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Research on typically developing children suggests the amount of adult talk they are exposed to can positively affect their social competence. With growth in the number of children with ASD entering the inclusive preschool classroom, there is a need to understand how adult talk in this context influences their development of social competence. This study aimed to determine: (1) the types and amounts of adult talk children with ASD receive in the preschool classroom; (2) the relationship between child characteristics (i.e., autism severity, language, cognitive ability and behavior) as well as setting characteristics (i.e., adult-child ratio and activity area) and adult talk; and (3) the link between adult talk and the socially competent behavior displayed by children with ASD. The data for this study were drawn from a larger study comparing the efficacy of comprehensive treatment models serving preschool-aged children with ASD. Children (ages 3-5) with ASD who were enrolled in business-as-usual (BAU) (n= 23) or LEAP (n= 43) inclusive preschool classrooms made up the sample. Preschoolers were videotaped for roughly 30 minutes during normal center time activities. Videotapes were coded post-hoc by observers naïve to the purposes of the study using adapted versions of two coding schemes: Kontos' (1999) Teacher Talk classification and the Code for Active Student Participation and Engagement-III. The results indicate that child (i.e., autism severity, cognitive ability) and setting (i.e., activity area) affected the types of talk children received. Further, preschoolers who received higher amounts of certain types of adult talk (e.g., supporting peer relations) had more concurrent displays of socially competent behavior. In examining children's social competence over time, it was found that higher amounts of supporting object play and positive social contacts talk positively affected certain indicators of children's social competence (e.g., social motivation), as reported by teachers. Alternatively, children who received large amounts of behavioral management talk at the beginning of the school year were perceived by teachers to have worsening social competence (e.g., social awareness) by the end of the year. Implications future research and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research study examined the challenges faced by early childhood education (ECE) in rural China based on a qualitative study of 217 kindergarten classrooms in a large agricultural, rural province. This study utilised onsite teacher surveys, interviews, and observational field notes. This investigation's findings revealed important information in regard to (a) enrollment, class size, and student--teacher ratios; (b) facilities, basic furnishings, and materials; (c) teacher qualifications; and (d) curriculum and pedagogy. Kindergartens in the rural province of Hebei, typical of Chinese provinces with economically disadvantaged students and inadequate ECE funding, were found to be of poor quality across every ECE indicator measured. For the future improvement and well-being of children and their families in rural China, the authors recommend reform policy to increase ECE quality by affiliating quality kindergartens with existing elementary public school structures and to improve teacher quality by advancing teacher benefits, professional status, and professional development opportunities.

AB  - Aspects of the French child-care system are described and contrasted with aspects of child care in the US. French child-care teachers are more highly educated and trained than those in the US but teach larger groups of children. Ethnographic observations were made of interaction patterns in 5 French child-care centers. Results suggest that French teacher–child interaction is warm, sensitive, and responsive to children and that teacher training and working conditions may offset the high adult–child ratios found in the French system.

The naturally occurring behaviors of 40 toddlers (mean age 19.5 mo) and their peers were time sampled. Daycare facilities were community based and varied in group size, age composition, and the number and type of play objects. Toddler–peer social interaction was similar in the 2 environments. Findings suggest research approaches that focus on the characteristics of the particular playmate in the toddler period and on emerging influences of the structure of the social setting at later stages of the Ss' social development.

AB  - Swedish leisure-time centres were formerly part of Swedish social and family policies but were transferred to an educational context in the 1990s. This transfer was accentuated by both the Education Act of 2010 and the new teacher training established in 2011, which also included education particularly directed for leisure-time centres. The state's intention with this discursive shift was to highlight education and learning within the activity in a more distinct way. This article is based on an ethnography-inspired study at one leisure-time centre called the Sunflower. The data are based on six weeks of field work including participating observations, field notes and walk-and-talk conversations. The study takes its point of departure from representations by staff concerning what they emphasise regarding the centre's activity, how these representations are related to each other and which strategies staff members use when talking about and monitoring the pupils' activities. The results show the strong presence of older traditions concerning values and practices regarding the performance at work: supporting children with good care, stressing the importance of children's free play and using a peripheral subject position during work. The results also show that a stress on the child-to-staff ratio as circumscribing the activity which is enhanced by the pupils misallocated age distribution.

AB  - Background We examined whether children cared for by stressed caregivers show lower socio-emotional well-being and more stress, compared with children cared for by less stressed caregivers. Methods Perceived stress and cortisol levels of professional caregivers ( n= 44), and associations with children's ( n= 44) well-being and cortisol levels in home-based child care were examined. Results Caregiver perceived stress and cortisol levels were related to children's well-being but not to children's cortisol levels. Children's social fearfulness acted as a moderator between caregivers' mean ratio of diurnal change in cortisol and children's well-being. When caregiver cortisol levels decreased, more fearful children were reported higher on well-being than less fearful peers. In contrast, when caregiver cortisol levels increased, more fearful children were reported lower on well-being. Conclusions The findings point to differential susceptibility. Child care organizations and parents need to notice that a non-stressful child care environment is in particular important for children with a difficult temperament.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of two types of Turkish early childhood education programs: private and public preschools. Three public and three private preschools in a district of Istanbul were randomly selected. The quality of preschools was assessed using the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale developed by Harms et al. The preschools were visited by the researcher and were observed for a nine-hour school day. Observations indicate that activities such as daily routines, parent–teacher interactions, personal and professional needs are more appropriately handled by private preschool teachers than public preschool teachers. Shortcomings exist in both types of preschools in their physical class arrangements, authoritarian teacher child interactions, poor teacher– student ratio, and emphasis on structured and paper–pencil activities. Results suggest the need for Turkish preschool programs to be more child and family centered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The authors collected information from caregivers, trained observers, and parents to investigate quality elements in child-care programs designed for young children in center-based settings. Participants were 75 parents of children aged 15 to 36 mo and their caregivers; from 13 child-care centers in a southeastern state. Observers collected indicators of program quality and process and structural quality indicators, including adult-child ratio, group size, use of planned activities, use of child-designated space, housekeeping activities, and caregiver-child interactions. Participants responded to questions regarding their child-rearing beliefs, social support networks, perceived stress levels, and demographic characteristics. The best predictors of higher quality care and sensitive caregiver-child interaction in centers were specialized caregiver training, higher adult-child ratios, use of planned activities, and less perceived stress by caregivers. Implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The predictors of quality child care for toddler-age children were examined in 30 center-based and 22 family child care settings. Trained observers collected information on adult/child ratios, group size, use of planned activities, use of child-designed space, housekeeping activities, as well as completed the Arnett Caregiver Interaction Scale and the Infant-Toddler Environmental Rating Scale or the Family Day Care Rating Scale. Ninety-seven parents of toddlers and 28 caregivers responded to questions regarding their childrearing beliefs, social support networks, perceived stress levels, demographic characteristics, and the prosocial attributes of the toddlers. Higher quality care and sensitive caregiver-child interaction in centers were predicted by specialized training, higher adult-child ratio, and less perceived stress by caregivers. In family child care, use of child-designed space emerged as the best predictor of higher quality care. Family characteristics were not significant predictors of quality of care. Few relationships between toddler prosocial attributes and quality indicators were found. The average quality of care in both settings was in the minimal to adequate range.

AB  - This article presents results of a study of 229 kindergarten teachers who completed a survey designed to gather information about the current state of Michigan kindergartens. In addition to detailed data that reveals teachers' literacy instructional practices, teachers provided written responses to the following open-ended questions: What are the main issues facing kindergarten teachers? What, if anything, would make a difference in your ability to provide the type of program you would like to provide? What kind of professional development would be useful to kindergarten teachers? Teachers identified issues related to working conditions (time, class size, materials) and literacy instruction (autonomy for decision-making, developmental appropriateness of curriculum, student readiness, parental involvement in literacy, and professional development). Their patterns of response and vibrant words provide a window on the current kindergarten teaching experience and highlight the pull (or tensions) that many teachers experience in their instructional decision making because of the complex links between policy and practice. Implications for future policy makers and professional development based in principles of emergent literacy are discussed.

AB  - The occurrence of potentially stressful events in young children's everyday environment was investigated. Two, three and four year old children who attended one of ten day care centers participated in the study. The most commonly encountered everyday stressors involved object struggles and conflicts over freedom of locomotion. The most common source of stress was another child and the most frequently observed responsibility for an event was the 'child is a victim of another child's aggression'. This may reflect preschool children's limited social skills and abilities and be due to characteristics of the day care setting (adult-child ratio, number of peers etc). Age effects differed according to the events but overall significant decreases were seen with age. Gender related effects were significant at age two, with two year old boys involved in more potentially stressful events than all other age/gender classifications. Verbal assertion was the most frequently used coping technique for eight of the ten potentially stressful situations, while problem solving was used when a child tried to do something with an object and social support was used when a child was a victim of an accident. The type of the event and the source of the stress seemed to play a role in the type of coping technique the young children utilized. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - 42 female child caregivers participated 1 of 6 focus groups to examine how, when, and why they discipline young children. Aggressive behavior, not listening, and sexually-related behaviors were the most likely behaviors to concern caregivers. These behaviors most frequently elicited the disciplinary strategies of time-out, explanations, and redirection. How caregivers respond to misbehaviors was analyzed in terms of the attributions the caregivers make in regard to these misbehaviors. Age, gender, home, family, society, caregiver emotion, and child care setting circumstances were the most frequently mentioned factors to affect caregiver discipline. Results also indicate that caregivers with higher levels of early childhood education and experience, and those working with smaller group and adult-to-child ratios provide more thoughtful answers that are more congruent with developmental appropriateness.

AB  - An exploratory study of attachment security with family child care providers was conducted with 41 toddlers (age 12-19 months). Temporal stability of caregiver-child attachment security was assessed using the Attachment Q-Set, observing each dyad on two occasions, 1 to 2 weeks apart. Contextual correlates of child care provider attachment were also examined, including infant and family background characteristics, infant-provider interactive involvement, quality of the parent-provider relationship, provider characteristics and working conditions, and aspects of child care quality. Attachment Q-Set security and infant-provider interactive involvement were found to be stable over time. Correlations and path analyses revealed that significant direct predictors of attachment security were the level of infant-provider interactive involvement, family socioeconomic status? and overall child care quality. Significant indirect predictors of attachment security (mediated through infant-provider interactive involvement) were child care group size, number of months with the provider, and age at entry into child care.

AB  - Although "top-down" indicators, such as the ratio of adults to children in classrooms and program rankings based on standardized test scores, can predict some of the future impact of children's education, "bottom-up" factors, such as whether children feel welcome and whether they find the learning activities to be meaningful and engaging, may have a greater effect on children's long-term development. Yet little is known about children's perceptions of their schools and how their views may differ depending on the type and quality of schools they attend. In the present study, three methods--interview, autophotography, and picture selection--were employed to learn about children's perceptions of their schools and whether their perspectives differed depending on whether they attended schools labeled "successful" or "unsuccessful." The 156 participants in kindergarten to fifth grade (ages 5 to 11) were interviewed about their school experiences. In the context of making books about their schools, children took photographs that they felt would show others what the schools were like. They also selected photographs from a standardized set of other photographs--one they thought "best showed" their school and one that showed what was "most important" to them. The following were among the results: (1) Participants at the unsuccessful school were more likely to identify school as being about academics and evaluation/tests and less about play/fun, especially in the early grades. (2) The importance of friendships was more evident among children at the successful school than among children at the unsuccessful school. (3) Among participants from both schools, the pictures that children selected that "best showed" their school usually differed from what was "most important" to them.

AB  - This study examined infant educators’ beliefs about infant language development in the context of early childhood classrooms. Participants were 59 educators who were employed to work directly with under-two-year-old children. Educators were interviewed to determine their understandings of infant language development and Grounded Theory qualitative techniques were used to develop a conceptual model which illustrates their perceptions of the relationships between contextual, personal and teaching and learning components of their classroom contexts. The model provides a means of conceptualising ‘insider’ practitioner voices on how, as a dynamic system, contextual, individual and pedagogical components mutually interact to bring about the kinds of experiences and interactions that can shape language development. Findings have implications for understanding educators’ perspectives on infant room quality, suggesting that issues related to educator-infant ratios, staff consistency, qualifications and professional knowledge about language development processes may impact efforts to provide intentional language development support.

AB  - This paper maintains that the two basic dimensions of developmentally appropriate practice are age appropriateness and individual appropriateness. For the latter dimension, individuals' patterns of growth, personality, families, and culture are believed to be important. Teachers who use developmentally appropriate practices believe that young children learn by doing; that play is valuable in allowing the child to develop in a natural way; and that young children's methods of learning should govern the ways in which one teaches, and not vice versa. Differences between programs using developmentally appropriate practices and those using more traditional practices are discussed. In developmentally appropriate practices: (1) the learner is viewed as having developing abilities; (2) learning is viewed as a creative activity; (3) classrooms are child-centered and often use volunteers and parents to obtain low adult-student ratios; and (4) discipline usually takes the form of guidance, redirection, or prevention. In a traditional program, the learner is viewed as having measurable abilities; learning is governed by a set of principles and consists of the acquisition of a set of skills; and classrooms are teacher-centered and directed. Briefly described is a developmentally appropriate kindergarten program designed by a rural public school system in Arkansas that worked in conjunction with a local university. (SH)

AB  - This paper explored the challenges to the infant care profession in Hong Kong crèches, with an aim to contribute to the existing early childhood care literature for reference and comparison elsewhere. A questionnaire survey was conducted with 55 childcare workers and 12 supervisors, followed by interviews with some selected participants to examine the education, experience, training, working conditions and staff--child ratios of the practitioners in crèches, and their perceptions towards the profession. The findings identified the areas for enhancing the education level and training of the practitioners to improve the quality of infant care. The results also indicated the problems of low salaries, unpleasant working conditions and inadequate staff--child ratio in the profession, discouraging high-calibre candidates from entering the field. This paper discussed the implications of the findings and offered some recommendations to raise the status of the infant care profession and the attractiveness of the job for prospective practitioners.

AB  - A study examined issues of quality in corporate-sponsored child care centers for children up to the age of 6. The study used a combination of methods, including a literature review, telephone interviews with corporations sponsoring child care centers, and visits to 12 corporate-sponsored child care centers. The findings came under the four headings of issues related to quality, discussion with experts in the field, characteristics of corporate-sponsored programs, and case studies of six corporate-sponsored programs. The study determined that the quality of a center depends largely on the staff who provide the care. Specific indicators of quality include: (1) staffing patterns--the ratio of adults to children, group sizes, staff schedules, and staff turnover; (2) staff credentials--educational background, experience, ongoing training; (3) wages and benefits for staff, which influence recruitment and retention of highly qualified staff; and (4) existence of an educational plan or philosophy that provides a framework for the teachers. Additional criteria that reflect a center's commitment to these quality indicators include licensing and accreditation, auspice (financial and legal ownership), and the operating budget allocation for staff.

AB  - To examine relationships between variations within daycare settings and adult caregiving behaviors, the social experiences of 40 toddlers (aged 18–22 mo) and their caregivers in family and center care were systematically observed. Caregivers were interviewed and conditions of caregiving recorded. Caregivers in both settings with fewer children in their care, who worked shorter hours, with less housework responsibilities engaged in more facilitative social stimulation, expressed more positive affect, were more responsive, and less restrictive and negative. Family daycare caregivers who worked in spaces specifically designed to be safe and appropriate for children were less restrictive of toddler activity. Adult–child ratio and caregiver training appeared to be the best indicators of quality care in center daycare, while a safe and appropriate caregiving environment and small groups appeared as quality indicators in family daycare.

AB  - Infants and toddlers the youngest and most vulnerable members of our society are more likely to experience abuse and neglect than children from any other age group. Among myriad other negative developmental outcomes, the experience of maltreatment places children at an increased risk of developing an internal working model of relationships that reflects an insecure, or a disordered attachment relationship pattern. It has been well established that maltreated children are able to develop secure attachment relationships with alternative caregivers (e.g., foster parents, family-members) and that preschool-aged maltreated children are able to develop secure attachment relationships with their childcare teachers. It has also been well established that childcare environments characterized by high levels of caregiver sensitivity, involvement, and positive emotional climate as well as low teacher-child ratios promote the development of secure attachment relationships between teachers and children. However, given the lack of early intervention in the form of therapeutic childcare services for our youngest survivors of maltreatment, the development of secure attachment relationships between maltreated infants and toddlers and their childcare teachers has yet to be investigated. Therefore, this case study of a therapeutic childcare agency for maltreated children documents attachment relationship development between maltreated infants and toddlers and their primary childcare teachers over time and describes the therapeutic childcare context in terms of structural and process quality as well as supports available to teachers. Findings support prior research that suggests that maltreated infants and toddlers, like their non-maltreated counterparts, can develop attachment relationships with their childcare teachers in the context of a childcare program characterized by teacher sensitivity, involvement, and low teacher-child ratios. Distinct trends in teacher-child attachment behavior as well as relationship patterns emerged over time. Further research is required to determine if these trends and patterns can be replicated with a larger and more diverse sample. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Since 1953, Norwegian national standards regulate ratios of children to staff training requirements, group sizes, leadership and subsidies. Both national and local subsidies support the management and qualify level of day care centers. In Norway a current viewpoint on quality in day care is to stimulate innovation in day care activities by rewarding local initiative and creativity. Outdoor activities and giving the children freedom to learn are highly valued. Preschool teacher education, which is three years at college, shares a common frame of a governmental curricular guideline as well as a nationwide curriculum for day care. A responsive and warm interaction between staff children and parents is a definite moral value of the preschool teacher profession. Current issues of quality are related to the shortage of highly qualified directors and leaders in public day cave as well as the expansion of private centers with questionable quality. Quality control of day care centers is now discussed as a necessary surveillance system of the quality of contexts and interactions in children's daily life.

Observations were categorized according to J. C. Watts's (1973) scale for each behavior setting in each center. Results indicate that Ss in the center with the 1:3 adult–child ratio received interaction experiences similar to those reported by Watts for comparably aged children who developed high levels of competence, while Ss in the other center (a 1:6 ratio) received interaction experiences comparable to those reported by Watts for children who developed lower levels of competence.

AB  - This study examined the applicability of Watts' Human Interaction Scale to day care settings, and was also concerned at a more general level with the question of whether it is possible for day care settings to approximate good homes. Six 2-year-olds in each of two day care centers were each videotaped for a total of 45 minutes in a variety of behavioral settings. Results indicated that: (1) the scale can be used in group settings with the addition of a distinction between adult/individual interaction and adult/group interaction; (2) interaction involving activities and interaction techniques which Watts found associated with high competence development occurs most frequently in structured activities and to some extent in free play settings. Also discussed: other results involving differences in the two day care centers; the adult/group mode of interaction; behavior setting sampling; adult responsiveness; adult/child ratios; quality versus quantity of interaction; and assessment of the direct impact of day care environments on the development of competence. It is concluded that day care can provide experiences comparable to good homes. (MS)

AB  - Reported are conclusions from the continuation of an investigation into cross-cultural aspects of education of children of 3-8 years of age. Discussion focuses on educational practices in Australia, Austria, India, Russia, and Zimbabwe. Topics include teacher actions and verbalizations, and school organization and administration. Teacher actions are discussed in terms of behavior toward individuals, small groups, large groups or whole classes, and teacher demonstrations of lesson content. The material on teacher verbalization focuses on such behavior as contributing bodily presence, responding to requests of children, elaborating on information already given, asking children to respond, and intervening to help students give the desired response. Concluding discussion includes notes on organization and administration, specifically pupil-teacher ratio, teacher and in-service training, and financial support. (RH)

AB  - The research presented in this paper explores how preschool teachers in Sweden negotiate tensions stemming from perceived cultural dilemmas among themselves, the children they work with, and the children´s parents or guardians. The aim in characterising this process of negotiation is to expand knowledge about how to adapt pedagogically to the increasing diversity of the preschool sector in Sweden. The study is based on focus group interviews with preschool teachers who work in schools where nearly 70% of the children are newly arrived immigrants or have parents or guardians who were born in a country other than Sweden. The interview data were subjected to a thematic analysis. Three themes emerged: Circumventing conflicts by keeping preschool peaceful; Culture as a barrier and opportunity for dealing with dilemmas; and engaging with conflicts as a means of developing the preschool profession. The themes are discussed in relation to Gert Biesta's concepts of the rational community and the community of those who have nothing in common.

AB  - This article is based on a collaborative study in Iceland, Sweden and Norway of the youngest children in institutional settings, such as preschools. At the present time, preschool curricula and frameworks are changing to include increased learning. However, preschool teacher education lacks sufficient focus on this age group. New preschool organisations depend both on the increased number of very young children in the system and on new versions of pedagogical approaches. This study is based on the voices of preschool staff who work with very young children. The results showed the dilemmas and challenges that these teachers experience in their everyday work.

AB  - As poverty, dysfunctional families, and special needs continue to affect students, educators seek improved ways to start children in formal education. One such approach is to lower the teacher-to-pupil ratios, and recent research shows that this method positively influences pupil achievement. How the process works is not well understood. To fill this gap in knowledge, an examination of how teachers teach in these classrooms is provided in this report. The study describes life in a primary-grade classroom (with a low teacher-pupil ratio) in a fully Chapter 1-eligible school. Procedures for the research included interviews, structured classroom observations, informal classroom visitations, and the comparison of project school processes with research, other small-class settings, and"regular" or non-small settings. The focus was on first grade results, with comparisons offered for kindergarten and second grade. Findings show that comparisons of the pre- and post-observations of teachers indicated few observed changes in their behaviors following inservice activities. However, teachers in small classes demonstrated high levels of individualized instruction and minimal discipline problems. Factors such as space and materials facilitated instruction, and pretests and posttests indicated that students' performance in the small classes (n=14) were significantly better than those in the larger (n=23) classes.

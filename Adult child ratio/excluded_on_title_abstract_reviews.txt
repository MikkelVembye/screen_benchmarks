AB  - Understanding the contributing variables that promote high-quality preschool is a complex and multilayered endeavor. Mounting evidence indicates that the structural measures of quality indicators typically used to validate preschool programs are not sufficient for determining quality experiences for students (e.g., Howes et al., 2008; Mashburn, et al., 2008). Whereas some studies have indicated that structural variables such as teacher educational attainment and teacher to child ratio (e.g., Cost Quality and Outcome Study) predict higher quality programming, these studies of more static and distal measures of program quality do not demonstrate as consistent and strong evidence as studies that have investigated process measures of program quality. Careful identification of the contributing factors related to quality preschool programming has important implications for policy makers. Using data from a state-funded preschool program, the focus of this study was to measure variables of process quality that focus on the interactions of teachers and students in relation to student outcomes while controlling for a number of structural variables typically used to validate quality preschool programming. Direct observations of classrooms, teachers, and students garnered both global ratings and real time duration of specific behaviors and interactions. It was hypothesized that classroom climate would relate to student receptive language gains and behavioral functioning of students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Child care licensing is a consumer protection responsibility of each state. Each licensing standard establishes a right that children and parents in private early care and education programs have in that state. Because each state sets its licensing standards at a level its citizens agree to support, child care differs dramatically among states. This report compares state child-staff ratio and group size requirements in child care licensing and examines changes from 1989 to 1996. The National Day Care Study (1979) found that low child-staff ratios have positive effects on children's test scores, child behavior, and staff behavior and influence child care costs directly. Infant-staff ratios also affect quality strongly. Ratios may vary widely among states because of differences in measurement techniques. Best practice ratios recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Public Health Association range from 3:1 for birth to 12 months to 12:1 for 9- to 12-year-olds. Group size also influences child and staff behavior; best practice figures range from eight infants in a group up to 12 months, to 24 school-age children in a group. Results of this national study indicate that for 9-month-olds, more than half the states set a ratio of 4:1, with few changes since 1989. For 18-month-olds, only 26 states have ratios of 5:1 or lower, with no change since 1989. For 3-year-olds, 20 states set a ratio of 10:1 or lower, with little change since 1989. A table delineates the child-staff ratios and group size by state for 9-, 18- and 36-month-olds for 1989 and 1996. (KDFB)

AB  - Rarely have scholars attempted to align school-based objectives with specific socialization processes to identify what might promote the development and achievement of such objectives. The goal of this chapter, therefore, is to describe what is known about the process of socialization within school settings and to offer suggestions for future theory development and research in this area. In this chapter, socialization is defined with reference to contextual affordances, that is, supports and opportunities that facilitate the development of children's school-based competencies. In this regard, schools are viewed as complex systems that can provide students with multiple affordances as a function of the school itself (e.g., size, heterogeneity of student body, teacher:child ratios), as well as through social interactions and interpersonal relationships that are embedded in the educational process. This chapter begins with a consideration of how to define competence within the context of school settings. Then, the literature on the processes of socialization is reviewed, including those associated with structural characteristics of schools, as well as more proximal social and interpersonal processes that might support competence development. Children's experiences in preschool and child care as well as in K-12 schools are considered. Finally, the chapter ends with a discussion of remaining issues and challenges to the field.

AB  - The current study provides a systematic examination of child care quality around the globe, using the Environment Rating Scales (ERS). Additional goals of this study are to examine associations between ERS process quality and structural features (group size, caregiver-child ratio) that underpin quality and between ERS and more proximal aspects of child care quality (caregiver sensitivity). Furthermore, we consider possible differences in ERS associations arising from scale characteristics (infant vs early childhood version, original version vs revised scale, full version vs shortened version). The reported meta-analysis combines results of ERS child care quality reported in 72 studies from 23 countries across five international geographic regions. Group center care appeared to be of average quality with higher quality levels in Australia/New Zealand and North America. Our results suggest that: (1) ERS characteristics are not associated with differences in ERS scores and (2) ERS scores are related to indicators of proximal quality of care (caregiver sensitivity) and, to a lesser degree, structural quality of care (caregiver-child ratio). The meta-analysis provided cross-cultural comparisons on child care quality on a common instrument as a means to advance discussion on child care quality internationally.

AB  - Practice and policy in early childhood education rely heavily on professional expertise and guidelines developed from research on early care and education (ECE) quality, but these guidelines have not been extensively researched. Data from six large studies of ECE quality were analyzed to relate structural and process quality indicators based on professional guidelines to childrenâs language, literacy, math, and social outcomes. Results indicated small gains related to some quality indicators (e.g., quality of teacherâchild interactions, curriculum, and teacher and director education) for some of the preschoolersâ outcomes, but not other indicators (e.g., global quality, group size). Combining quality indicators into a single index also predicted gains in preschoolersâ language and literacy scores, but effect sizes for the quality rating were smaller than for individual indicators.

AB  - Reviews studies on the effects of daycare (DC). A number of weaknesses in the DC literature are pointed out, including problems of ecological validity and the failure to examine for differential effects. It is concluded that (1) the cognitive development of middle-class children does not appear to have been affected by participation in DC. (2) There is little evidence that attendance at DC weakens attachment. (3) There is no way to challenge (to correct or corroborate) the potential harmful effects of DC on children's social development from existing studies. (4) It is not possible to make valid comparisons between group and family DC with respect to the quality of care received or impact on the child from existing studies. (5) There is evidence that group size is significantly related to developmental outcomes for children in DC. Ss who attended DC in smaller groups performed better on such measures as the Preschool Inventory and the PPVT. (6) Relatively little is known about the week-to-week, day-to-day, moment-to-moment transactions and events that occur in DC, especially family care. The few studies that have considered them have had as their primary focus comparison of one form of DC to another or comparing DC to home.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to synthesize and summarize the basic conclusions of literature concerning the effects of day care on infants and young children. The first section of the document briefly indicates limitations of day care research. The second section offers research-based generalizations concerning the effects of day care on intellectual, emotional, social, and physical development (including health and safety). The third section focuses on comparisons between center and family day care; research reviewed indicates that the most critical day care variable is program quality. The fourth section reviews findings of research related to components of quality day care, such as group size, child/staff ratio, caregiver qualifications, caregiver continuity, curriculum, physical environment, and parent involvement. The fifth section points out implications of findings for caregivers, administrators, parents, social policy, legislation, and researchers. A table summarizes and comments on 16 studies comparing effects and characteristics of center day care and family day care. In addition, recommendations for controlling communicable diseases in day care facilities are appended. (RH)

AB  - This report summarizes research on the impacts of alternative early intervention programs to prevent school failure. Also considered are the magnitude of estimates of program effects and policy implications of using the programs. The nine principal types of early schooling programs reviewed are those involving: (1) substantial reductions in class size; (2) provision of instructional aides in the early grades; (3) preschool for 4-year-olds; (4) extended-day kindergarten; (5) retention in kindergarten and first grade; (6) provision of transitional first grade, developmental kindergarten, and other extra-year programs for immature or at-risk children; and (7) one-to-one tutoring; and (8) IBM's Writing to Read Program; and (9) Success for All program. The review concludes that among the nine strategies, the most effective by far for preventing early school failure are those that involve one-to-one tutoring in reading for first graders, especially in structured models that use well-trained certified teachers as tutors. Such programs not only have the greatest immediate effects on reading achievement, but they are also the only programs known to have lasting effects, at least through the third grade. Appended are 62 references. (Author/GLR)

AB  - A meta-analysis of published research on the effects of nonmaternal care on child development was undertaken. One hundred and one studies published between 1957 and 1995 involving 32,271 children met the inclusion criteria. Most of the children in these studies came from middle to upper-middle class homes (63 studies; 62.3%), were Caucasian (77 studies; 76.2%), and were American (78; 77.2%). Dependent variables in four domains (cognitive, social-emotional, behavioral, and attachment) were coded and effect sizes (d) between maternal and nonmaternal care (independent variable) were computed for both weighted and unweighted effect sizes. Results of unweighted effect size analysis indicated that there were negative consequences for nonmaternal care for cognitive outcomes (d =.14), social-emotional outcomes (d =.26), behavioral outcomes (d =.38), and attachment to mother (d =.39). Weighted effect size analysis decreased magnitude of effect sizes in the social-emotional (d =.16) and behavioral (d =.28) domains, but not in the cognitive and attachment domains. Studies within each of the daycare and maternal employment research camps were analyzed as separate aggregates. To test potential effect size difference between research aggregates, Levene statistic for homogeneity of variance was computed. There were no significant differences across all four domains. Effect size analysis was conducted for each of the daycare and maternal employment aggregates across all domains. Analysis of equality of effect size between daycare and maternal employment research aggregates was conducted. Negative outcomes for children in nonmaternal care were significantly greater for children sampled in the daycare research aggregate compared to children sampled in the maternal employment aggregate in both the social-emotional and behavioral domains. Moreover, males tended to fare more poorly with nonmaternal care than did females. Analysis of potential mediating family, quality of care and study characteristic variables were assessed and analyzed with quality of study as covariate. There was a lack of impact of study characteristics on effect size in the four domains. In the social-emotional domain, studies published after 1985 produced a greater weighted effect size than studies prior to 1985. Non-white children fared worse in nonmaternal care compared to white children. In the behavioral domain, children with siblings fared better in nonmaternal care than did children without siblings. In the attachment domain, children in nonmaternal care with higher caregiver-child ratios fared worse than did those in lower caregiver-child ratios. Independent assessments of quality of study and quality of care were conducted, quality of care did not mediate outcomes in the four domains. The results are discussed within the context of attachment theory and the possible implications for public policy are raised. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - A review of the literature on educational outcomes for children of early childhood education can provide relevant information for policymakers. Research suggests that the quality of programs offered in early childhood centers affects the extent to which children experience education. On the basis of the studies, the main characteristics of low quality centers are: (1) inappropriate caregiver-child ratios; (2) inadequate staff training; (3) large group size; (4) high staff turnover; (5) inexperienced staff; (6) inappropriate programs; (7) low levels of interaction; (8) limited parental involvement; (9) low maintenance of indigenous cultures; and (10) an inadequate physical environment. Insufficient provision of early childhood services adversely affects all children, but affects most strongly those children who are at risk. Recent research also highlights the importance of funding levels in the maintenance of quality programs. In New Zealand, the quality of early childhood centers and the provision of early childhood education compares favorably with the quality and provision found in the United States. Research with children in New Zealand childcare centers supports the importance of high staff-child ratios, staff training, and ongoing inservice training. (Contains 86 references.) (SW)

AB  - Child-staff ratios are a key quality indicator in early childhood education and care (ECEC) programs. Better ratios are believed to improve child outcomes by increasing opportunities for individual interactions and educational instruction from staff. The purpose of this systematic review, and where possible, meta-analysis, was to evaluate the association between child-staff ratios in preschool ECEC programs and children's outcomes. Searches of Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, websites of large datasets and reference sections of all retrieved articles were conducted up to July 3, 2015. Cross-sectional or longitudinal studies that evaluated the relationship between child-staff ratios in ECEC classrooms serving preschool aged children and child outcomes were independently identified by two reviewers. Data were independently extracted from included studies by two raters and differences between raters were resolved by consensus. Searches revealed 29 eligible studies (31 samples). Child-staff ratios ranged from 5 to 14.5 preschool-aged children per adult with a mean of 8.65. All 29 studies were included in the systematic review. However, the only meta-analysis that could be conducted was based on three studies that explored associations between ratios and children's receptive language. Results of this meta-analysis were not significant. Results of the qualitative systematic review revealed few significant relationships between child-staff ratios and child outcomes construed broadly. Thus, the available literature reveal few, if any, relationships between child-staff ratios in preschool ECEC programs and children's developmental outcomes. Substantial heterogeneity in the assessment of ratios, outcomes measured, and statistics used to capture associations limited quantitative synthesis. Other methodological limitations of the research integrated in this synthesis are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Noting that child care licensing is the first line of protection for children in out-of-home child care settings in the United States, this issue of NCEDL Spotlights summarizes research findings relating various program characteristics to program quality and provides recommendations for state licensing requirements and funding policies. The issue summarizes research findings related to: (1) child-to-staff ratio and group size; (2) staff turnover and compensation; (3) staff education and training; (4) director competence; (5) design and maintenance of the physical environment; and (6) relationships and activities. Recommendations for states include: (1) hiring more licensing staff to adequately enforce standards; (2) raising their standards to reduce the risk of harm to children; (3) requiring staff training specific to the age group served; (4) requiring directors to have management and child development training; (5) requiring substantial annual training with college credit for all child care workers; and (6)raising preservice qualifications. Recommendations related to funding policies include establishing fiscal standards and monitoring for subsidized care not covered by licensing, paying higher rates for higher quality care, and withdrawing subsidy from programs with records of repeated noncompliance.

AB  - This report is designed to help Pennsylvania policymakers compare two current school reform ideas that are intended to improve student achievement: private school vouchers and class size reduction. It begins with a brief history of educational vouchers, then reviews the achievement effects of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Cleveland, Ohio, educational voucher programs. The reported benefits of these programs are compared to the benefits of reducing class size in grades K-3, using data from studies on class size conducted in Tennessee, Indiana, Nevada, California, and Wisconsin. The report concludes with policy recommendations for Pennsylvania based on evidence which indicates that small classes generate the greatest gains in kindergarten and grade 1. These recommendations include providing universal, publicly funded, full-day kindergarten with student-teacher ratios of 15:1; reducing class size in first grade to 15 students; and implementing an experimental program of class size reductions in grades 2 and 3 in which class size reductions are achieved in a variety of ways.

AB  - This review of research literature explores the possible harmful effects of day care programs on children's health and physical development, motor development, cognitive development, and social and emotional development, and suggests how variations in staff/child ratios may influence these effects. Two broad categories of conditions are identified as being harmful to children: directed techniques in which the caregiver is being actively harmful and general sensory deprivation which can be active but often takes the form of benign neglect. Findings indicate harm is an elusive concept: children can be harmed physically, but psychological harm requires severe deprivation over extended periods of time before consequences become irreversible. Child/staff ratios are examined in relation to child characteristics, setting (family-style or center-based), program philosophy, caregiver characteristics, and level of standards (for minimal vs. optimal quality programs). Findings indicate that low child/staff ratios tend to produce quieter, less aggressive children who perform better on standardized tests. It is suggested that the Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements (FIDCR) should focus on specifying the actual number of children working with a caregiver, rather than an overall ratio of all children to all caregivers in a program.

AB  - This chapter discusses evidence concerning the effects of alternative early childhood programs for different lengths of time on children's development and the implications of recent advances in knowledge for specific policy alternatives. The authors show that both model (e.g., pilot) and large-scale early education programs have accomplished many of their short- and long-term goals, including enhancing children's cognitive skills, increasing social maturity, and reducing rates of grade retention and special education placement. Although the overall pattern of findings is similar between model and large-scale programs, the effects of large-scale programs such as Head Start are smaller in size and less consistent from program to program. The characteristics of the successful programs discussed include the quality and quantity of treatment dosage (e.g., more is generally better), provision of developmentally appropriate services, use of smaller class sizes, implementation by well-trained staff, and quality of parent involvement. Based on the evidence reviewed, the authors indicate that in balancing cost and effectiveness, 'lite' early childhood programs are unlikely to work, and that it is better to provide more extensive and longer lasting educational and family services to fewer children than less extensive services for shorter periods of time to greater numbers of children.

AB  - This report provides a literature review of the evidence on the quality of early childhood education and care for children under three. It considers the implications for policy and practice, particularly for the Government's programme of free early years provision for disadvantaged two year-olds. The review of the research evidence identified four key dimensions of good quality pedagogy for all children under three: (1) Stable relationships and interactions with sensitive and responsive adults; (2) A focus on play-based activities and routines which allow children to take the lead in their own learning; (3) Support for communication and language; and (4) Opportunities to move and be physically active. In order to deliver high quality pedagogy, practitioners need to be skilled and knowledgeable and to work within environments which support them in their practice. The review of the research evidence suggests five "key conditions" for quality: (1) Knowledgeable and capable practitioners, supported by strong leaders; (2) A stable staff team with a low turnover; (3) Effective staff deployment (e.g. favorable ratios, staff continuity); (4) Secure yet stimulating physical environments; and (5) Engaged and involved families.

AB  - Recent research suggests that quality of experience in child care centers and family child care homes in the United States is mediocre. The research literature over the past 20 years indicates how variations in quality of care in center-based and family child care affect children's development. Higher levels of quality across a wide range of child care settings are associated with enhanced social skills, reduced behavior problems, increased cooperation, and improved language in children. There appear to be no detrimental effects of infants' attachment relations with their mothers as long as mothers provide adequate attention to infants at home. Longitudinal studies have found that some benefits in the social and cognitive domains persist into elementary school. The dimensions of quality most strongly related to child well-being include structural features of the child care setting such as lower child-staff ratios and smaller group sizes and caregiver-child dynamics, especially the caregiver's sensitivity and responsiveness in interactions with children. Structural features of child care settings provide the foundation for higher-quality dynamics, justifying increased costs that smaller ratios and group sizes entail. The research base for these findings includes studies using experimental and nonexperimental designs. Stronger designs and analytic techniques are needed to understand the contribution of child care quality and family characteristics on children's development. Not enough is currently known to guide policy by specifying the point at which lower levels of quality are clearly detrimental to children. Defining thresholds of quality along its critical dimensions is the next research challenge. (Contains approximately 75 references.) (KB)

AB  - Because of the increased attention to family day care resulting from several state and national initiatives to improve quality, there is a need for a solid knowledge base about family day care. This book examines recent research on family day care. The book is divided into six chapters according to focus. Chapter 1 examines the ecology of family day care, how caregivers and children behave, caregiver-child interactions, quality variations, and the effects of family day care enrollment on children's development. Chapters 2 and 3 include descriptive data of family day care providers, including their personal, professional, and program characteristics. Chapter 4 focuses on the clientele of family day care and addresses family and child characteristics, parents' satisfaction with child care, and provider-family relationships. Chapter 5 reviews training methods and outcomes. Chapter 6 examines the regulatory climate in the United State by comparing states with respect to licensing versus registration, how regulatory status is determined, group sizes, training requirements, and age-level limitations, including methods of family day care accreditation or credentialing. Each of these chapters is followed by a discussion of the implications of the research on policy and practice. The seventh chapter examines the key issues of compensation and affordability, quality, training and professionalism, regulation, family support, and turnover. This chapter also looks toward the future of family day care. Contains 170 references. (KB)

AB  - Preparing America's children to start school ready to learn will depend in large part on the availability, quality, and affordability of early education and care. Research conducted since the 1970s indicates that, despite increases, the supply of formal early education and care programs is not adequate to meet the needs of all families. Many centers and regulated child care programs are operating at capacity, while many parents of preschoolers report that they would prefer another type of care. Formal education and care options appear to be more limited for children at risk of later school failure. Average group sizes, child-staff ratios, and teacher turnover have increased since the late 1970s, while teacher qualifications have improved dramatically. The quality of care has decreased since the 1970s in order to keep parent fees affordable. First, this paper presents data from the Profile of Child Care Settings (PCS) study on the availability and adequacy of options for formal care, utilization rates, parental satisfaction with care, admission policies, recruitment strategies, average enrollment, and enrollment of children from low-income and minority families. Next, other studies on the availability, quality, and affordability of formal early education and care are reviewed. Information is presented on: (1) average group sizes in centers and regulated family child care; (2) child-staff ratios in both settings; (3) caregiver qualifications in centers and regulated home-based settings; (4) turnover among caregivers; (5) organizational sponsorship of home-based providers; (6) parent fees; and (7) revenues from government sources.

AB  - This paper addresses multiple perspectives on the quality of early childhood care and education, including lessons learned from programs in various countries, the implications of these perspectives, and recommendations for the improvement of early childhood provision. It also examines the ideas expressed in the 1994 "Start Right" report on early childhood provision issued by the Royal Society for the Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in London, England. The paper reviews five perspectives on quality: (1) top-down, which focuses on caregiver-child ratios, staff qualifications, and physical environment; (2) bottom-up, which considers the views of the children in the program; (3) inside, or staff views; (4) outside-in, which focuses on parent attitudes; and (5) outside, or the community and society at-large. The paper recommends the strengthening of early childhood teacher education programs, the use of mixed-age grouping in early childhood programs, and the use of parent cooperative models of early childhood provision, by which all parents would have direct involvement in their young children's care and education.

AB  - There is a strong association between the quality of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) provision and the outcomes for children, with high quality ECEC being associated with better child outcomes later in life. This brief reviewed the broad range of indicators that have been linked to quality, with a focus on understanding how these indicators relate to quality and eventual child outcomes. Following the academic literature on this subject we distinguished between structural quality, which relates to the physical environment and staffing requirement, and process quality, which relates to curricular practices, caregiver qualities, and parental involvement. We found that the interaction between structural and process indicators of ECEC quality is complex, and varies significantly across socio-economic, cultural and national contexts, which reflects the beliefs, needs, roles, and motivations of the different stakeholders involved in defining ECEC services. Despite this complexity we identified several structural indicators which are frequently considered indicators of high process quality. For each of these indicators we present policy levers for improving ECEC quality, and discuss the context in which these levers work, i.e. whether they act at national level, family and community level or at the level of the childcare setting. Key Findings: (1) Childcare quality and the associated child outcomes can be measured by looking at structural indicators, which relate to inputs such as the physical environment and staffing requirements, and process indicators, which relate to the processes that are required to deliver ECEC services and how children experience these inputs; (2) High process quality often follows from high structural quality: structural indicators such as staff-child ratios or the availability of sufficient learning materials facilitate positive child experiences and interaction with the childcare environment; (3) To understand differences between EU member states in ECEC quality it is important to relate these indicators to the cultural, educational and social context in which the ECEC is provided; and (4) Within different policy contexts we identified potential policy levers for improving ECEC quality, based on structural factors which are frequently considered indicators of high process quality.

AB  - This paper investigates the evidence for adult-infant ratios in day care centers, finding that current evidence is based largely on the premise that a low number of infants per adult should result in greater interaction between the adults and the infants, and, thereby, better infant care. Support for this premise is derived from three main sources: (1) research conducted on animals and institutionalized infants; (2) research which shows that small numbers of children per adult can result in increased IQ's and cognitive functions; and (3) statistical reports which show high infant mortality rate, particularly among children of low social status parents. It is concluded that the polemics over staff-infant ratios in day care centers can only be resolved by scientific research into day care center conditions, and surveys of staff and parents of children served in the centers under consideration. Quality day care, rather than ratios, is the issue to be emphasized. Also discussed are a number of points of departure for determining quality day care and characteristics of good early childhood programs. (Author/MS)

AB  - Undertaken as a background paper for an early childhood education policy study intended to identify current issues in early childhood education and policy alternatives for consideration by the State Board of Education of Illinois, this report focuses on the effectiveness of early childhood education programs. Specifically addressed are (1) reasons commonly advanced for offering education at an early age, (2) indicators of program effectiveness, (3) types of programs and program characteristics in the light of their relative effectiveness, (4) the SES of children who benefit from programs, and (5) the developmental role of early childhood education programs in the child's learning environment. A review of research for each of the following topics is covered in the paper: rationale for early childhood education, indicators of program effectiveness (including IQ, scholastic achievement, scholastic placement, non-cognitive development, and social responsibility), types of characteristics of programs (including leadership, program duration, adult-child ratio, curriculum, continuity, program location, and parent involvement), the SES difference of children in relation to benefits from early childhood education, and the learning environment.

AB  - Quality of child care has been shown to have a crucial impact on childrenâs development and psychological adjustment, particularly for orphans with a history of maltreatment and trauma. However, adequate care for orphans is often impacted by unfavorable caregiverâchild ratios and poorly trained, overburdened personnel, especially in institutional care in countries with limited resources and large numbers of orphans. This systematic review investigated the effects of structural interventions and caregiver trainings on child development in institutional environments. The 24 intervention studies included in this systematic review reported beneficial effects on the childrenâs emotional, social, and cognitive development. Yet, few studies focused on effects of interventions on the childâcaregiver relationship or the general institutional environment. Moreover, our review revealed that interventions aimed at improving institutional care settings have largely neglected violence and abuse prevention. Unfortunately, our findings are partially limited by constraints of study design and methodology. In sum, this systematic review sheds light on obstacles and possibilities for the improvement in institutional care. There must be greater efforts at preventing violence, abuse, and neglect of children living in institutional care. Therefore, we advocate for combining attachment theory-based models with maltreatment prevention approaches and then testing them using rigorous scientific standards. By using approaches grounded in the evidence, it could be possible to enable more children to grow up in supportive and nonviolent environments.

AB  - Most teachers and the public believe that children in kindergarten and the primary grades benefit from small classes because of children's need for individualized instruction and teacher attention. This report, part of a comprehensive policy study of early childhood education, presents a review of the research on the effect of class size on student outcomes, including achievement and adjustment to school. Topics covered include the following: (1) child development theory, (2) class size research, (3) a review of practices in South Carolina, Florida, and Indiana (4) a review of current Illinois statutes and practices, and (5) a summary of the findings in terms of policy implications for the Illinois State Board of Education. A review of the mandates for class size in the School Code of Illinois (1983) is given and tables provide comparisons between grades and types of programs. Data on kindergarten/primary class sizes of three selected states, South Carolina, Florida, and Indiana, is highlighted because of the different methods used in these states to achieve lower student/teacher ratios. A table in the appendix summarizes the recommended class sizes for kindergarten through third grade for all fifty states. In conclusion, this review shows that there is general agreement that at the primary grades smaller classses facilitate learning and that class size must be sufficiently small - at least below 20 - for significant benefits.

AB  - Prepared to assist Congress in its deliberations of various child care proposals, this report identifies key child care center standards that are critical in helping to ensure high quality child care. The article also examines the extent to which states incorporate these standards into their own standards, and discusses other important issues that relate to child care standards and their effect on quality. The analysis clearly shows that the standards which appear to be good predictors of high quality child care are those which focus on caregiver education and training, child-to-staff ratios, group sizes, and safety and health. Except for group size, all states have standards in the key areas identified, although the extent to which state standards reflected those set by the National Association for the Education of Young Children and the National Health and Safety Performance Standards varied. The report also discusses other key issues that affect child care quality, including caregiver turnover and caregiver wages. (JPB)

AB  - This dissertation is comprised of three separate manuscripts, each focusing on a unique aspect of child care. Together, they examine both family and child characteristics that are associated with parental decisions regarding child care and provide a better understanding of the impact of child care on children. The first two studies use a longitudinal sibling study consisting of 716 children within 358 families to investigate between- and within-family variables that are associated with child care use, stability, and type. A specific focus is on 'going beyond' typical demographic variables by including two aspects of the psychosocial family environment (i.e., maternal depression and marital conflict). Associations between stability of care and type of setting and children's language and social-emotional behaviour are also explored. The third paper focuses exclusively on studying the effects of child-staff ratios on child development by conducting a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of published research. This dissertation provides badly needed utilization data for Canada. It also highlights important differences in child care utilization patterns between the current Canadian sample and U.S. data and therefore calls into question the appropriateness of generalizing U.S. findings to the Canadian context. Inferential results indicate that child care use, stability, and type are associated with characteristics of the family and thus highlight inequalities that may exist between Canadian families in accessing child care. Controlling for these family characteristics, a higher frequency of marital conflict within the home was associated with greater odds of having attended child care. Finally, there was very little evidence of child care effects on children's functioning across the three manuscripts. Discussion centers on the importance of identifying child care selection factors and the complexity of identifying child care effects given methodological and conceptual limitations inherent in the child care literature.

AB  - â¢ Developmental theory suggests that children develop within complex systems, but most research on ECE focuses on discrete aspects of quality. â¢ This study uses a framework common in ECE policy to examine the association between ECE quality defined by multiple indicators and child outcomes. â¢ Replicated analyses were conducted with six large studies of ECE quality to relate structural and quality indicators to child outcomes. â¢ Small gains in child outcomes were observed related to quality of teacherâchild interactions, curriculum, and teacher and director education. â¢ Combining quality indicators into a single index also predicted gains in preschoolers' language and literacy scores, but effect sizes were small. Practice and policy in early childhood education rely heavily on professional expertise and guidelines developed from research on early care and education (ECE) quality, but these guidelines have not been extensively researched. Data from six large studies of ECE quality were analyzed to relate structural and process quality indicators based on professional guidelines to children's language, literacy, math, and social outcomes. Results indicated small gains related to some quality indicators (e.g., quality of teacherâchild interactions, curriculum, and teacher and director education) for some of the preschoolers' outcomes, but not other indicators (e.g., global quality, group size). Combining quality indicators into a single index also predicted gains in preschoolers' language and literacy scores, but effect sizes for the quality rating were smaller than for individual indicators.

AB  - Reviews literature on the influences of ratio and group size (GS) on children's development in day care. When measured separately, ratio and GS are sometimes, but not always related to children's development. When included as variables in quality clusters, ratio and GS are more likely to be related to developmental outcomes. GS more consistently influences development in the expected direction than ratio. This suggests the need for increased attention to GS in the policy arena. Regardless of methodology, ratio and GS explain a relatively small portion of the variance in children's development. Ratio and GS have been found to have both direct and indirect effects on development, indicating that they are potentially valuable as proxy measures of children's experience in day care programs.

AB  - This report examines the evidence that high-quality preschool programs can help to improve the school readiness of at-risk children, focusing on 10 programs that have been the subjects of careful evaluations. These programs include four well-known "model programs" (High/Scope Perry Preschool Project, the Carolina Abecedarian Project, the Chicago Child-Parent Centers, and the New York State Experimental Prekindergarten program) and the federal Head Start program, as well as state programs in Florida, Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, and Texas. The report concludes with a discussion of the characteristics that distinguish these programs as high-quality in the areas of health and safety standards, student-to-teacher ratios and class size, teacher qualifications and compensation, curricula, and parent involvement.

AB  - This background paper discusses the current system of child care finance in Washington State and analyzes options for improvement. It describes prominent characteristics of the early childhood care and education system, findings relating program quality to staff/child ratios and staff educational levels, characteristics of quality, parent preferences about care, needs for quality care, and the current financing system. A model of financing is presented involving individual employee benefit accounts for early childhood care and education. These accounts would have a 50/50 employer match which can be saved and invested, and drawn down as needed. The government would provide tax incentives to employees and employers to create a backup pool for non-covered employees and to invest in teacher training. Preliminary cost estimates for parents, government, community, and employers are discussed. The report also examines the increased costs of moving to a high quality child care and education system. Mechanisms to directly link funding to quality through a combination of regulation and incentives are examined. The report's appendix compares early childhood care and education in the United States and other countries, delineates different ways to finance early childhood education, and illustrates the use of sliding fee scales. An annotated list of national and state resources in child care, early education, and work/family relationship concludes the report. (KB)

AB  - This study uses data from a comprehensive database of U.S. early childhood education program evaluations published between 1960 and 2007 to evaluate the relationship between class size, child-teacher ratio, and program effect sizes for cognitive, achievement, and socioemotional outcomes. Both class size and child-teacher ratio showed nonlinear relationships with cognitive and achievement effect sizes. For child-teacher ratios 7.5:1 and lower, the reduction of this ratio by one child per teacher predicted an effect size of 0.22 standard deviations greater. For class sizes 15 and smaller, one child fewer predicted an effect size of 0.10 standard deviations larger. No discernible relationship was found for larger class sizes and child--teacher ratios. Results were less clear for socioemotional outcomes due to a small sample.

AB  - States across the country are developing pre-kindergarten standards that articulate expectations for preschooler's learning and development and define the manner in which services will be provided. There are two different types of standards: student outcome standards and program standards. Student outcome standards define the knowledge and skills children are expected to demonstrate by the end of their preschool year. Program standards describe characteristics of the preschool program, such as required teacher qualifications and student-teacher ratio. This Information Capsule provides a summary of research-based recommendations for policymakers and educators who are developing each type of standard. This paper also reviews factors that contribute to gaps in children's preschool readiness. The factor that has been found to correlate most highly with preschool learning disparities is family income level. Children's home learning environment, parents' level of educational attainment, ethnic and cultural influences, as well as parental beliefs and behaviors are also related to school readiness and school performance outcomes. However, since most of these factors are strongly tied to socioeconomic status, researchers have concluded that income level is the most powerful predictor of children's educational success. A brief discussion of the research, indicating that participation in high-quality preschool programs can significantly reduce early learning disparities by diminishing the negative effects of family and environmental risk factors, is included. Finally, a description of Miami-Dade County Public Schools' pre-K programs is provided. (Contains 1 table.)

AB  - Research studies on the length and time scheduling of the school day, class sizes and teacher self-concept were examined in an attempt to determine the influence of these variables on the academic success and developmental growth of children during their kindergarten year and beyond. Section I reviews research literature on class size and discusses nine major statements on the effects of class size on both teachers and students. Section II reports on the results of several studies dealing with the length and scheduling (full day, half day, alternate full days) of the school day. Section III contains conclusions and recommendations. Major results are discussed. The literature reviewed on class size generally supported the smaller class size as being more beneficial than larger classes in the areas of cognitive development, academic development, social development, emotional development, teacher effectiveness and teacher satisfaction. The literature search on length and scheduling of the school day did not produce conclusive evidence as to the advantages of half-day or full-day programs for children. However, teachers who worked with two groups of children each day indicated frustration with trying to provide for all the needs and interests of two different sets of children. Teacher self-concept appeared to be a variable that affected student self-concept and school achievement. (Author/SE)

AB  - Over the past two decades, early childhood educators and researchers have identified a number of factors that are essential to the provision of quality out-of-home care for young children. Some researchers have focused on the relative salience of a particular aspect of care as an indicator of quality; significant factors include adult-child ratio, group size, and caregiver training and compensation. Others have investigated the effects of overall child care quality on specific outcomes for the children enrolled, for example, on language or social development. This study identifies an inherent limitation in the existing literature by demonstrating that children's experience of child care quality is neither categorical nor additive; it is comprehensive, immediate, and far more complex than these broad indicators can reveal. This dissertation explores the intersection of child care practice, social policy, and child development theory and research in a unique format. The manuscript synthesizes original research, which consists of structured observations of children in a variety of child care settings, with those research findings in the field that are relevant to recognizing and promoting quality early childhood programs. Issues of child care quality are examined from the children's perspective through an account of a typical day in two very different child care centers. The days described represent composites of observations that are reconstructed to exemplify conditions in poor and good quality child care. The stories demonstrate how children's child care experiences vary as a function of the conjoined effects of different quality indicators. The daily events, interactions, and environmental descriptions are annotated with extensive references to the research literature that interpret and illuminate the anecdotal narrative. What distinguishes the design of this study from others is its ability to describe the cumulative effects of specific quality indicators on the overall character of a child's experience in child care. Examined from the children's perspective, policies and practices that influence the quality of care take on tangible dimensions that allow adults-early childhood educators, policymakers, and parents-to understand how their actions and decisions affect children's lives, often dramatically, each day.

AB  - This report provides an overview of findings from the research on primary class size reduction as a strategy to improve student learning. Its purpose is to provide a comprehensive and balanced picture of a very popular educational reform strategy that has often been seen as a "quick fix" for improving students' opportunities to learn in schools. The report draws from a comprehensive review of the body of research on class size reduction in Canada and the United States, describes recent Canadian trends in class size reduction, and identifies the major findings and conclusions from a recent study of Ontario's Primary Class Size Reduction (PCS) initiative. Concentrating on the Ontario initiative, the report describes the policy context that gave rise to primary class size reduction and the province's implementation strategy. It summarizes the impact of primary class size reduction on teaching and learning and on the work of administrators in schools and school districts. The study was designed to provide information on the existing research about class size reduction; broad province-wide trends in terms of costs and achievements; direction provided by school districts and principals during implementation; changes in students' and teachers' experiences of teaching and learning; parents' perception of primary class size reduction; the intersection of class size reduction policies with other policy initiatives; and recommendations for policies or programs to maximize the benefits from class size. The research team reviewed the research base and analyzed statistical data collected by the Ministry of Education between 2003-04 and 2007-08. Much of the study involved field research in eight school districts, 24 schools, and 84 classrooms. Classroom observations were undertaken at each primary grade level, from Kindergarten to Grade 3 (K-3). All teachers were surveyed in each school. Parent surveys included representation from every school district in Ontario. [For "Ontario's Primary Class Size Reduction Initiative: Report on Early Implementation," see ED573357.]

AB  - The first years of life lay the foundations for a child's future development and learning. Many countries have increased their financial support for provision of early childhood education and care (ECEC) over the past years. More recently, the focus of debate has been shifting from expanding access to affordable ECEC to enhancing its quality. A growing body of research suggests that the magnitude of the benefits for children will depend on the level of quality of early childhood services, with especially strong evidence in the case of disadvantaged children. In light of budgetary constraints, policy makers require the latest knowledge base of the quality dimensions that are most important for ensuring children's development and early learning. However, current research is often narrow in focus or limited to programme-level or national-level conclusions. This book expands the knowledge base on this topic. It draws lessons from a cross-national literature review and meta-analysis of the relationship between early childhood education and care structure (e.g. child-staff ratios, staff training and qualifications), process quality (i.e. the quality of staff-child interactions and developmental activities), and links to child development and learning. This report concludes with key insights, as well as avenues for further research. [This work was written with contributions from Victoria Liberatore, Arno Engel, and Miho Taguma, and was produced with the financial support of the Jacobs Foundation Switzerland.

AB  - The paper reviews available evidence on the impact of child-care centers attendance on children's cognitive and social development as well as cost-benefit analyses related to compensatory programs for disadvantaged children. Most research found a connection between child-care centers attendance and more favorable cognitive development in terms of school readiness, in which the literature particularly emphasizes importance of cognitive-oriented curriculum and the group size. In the area of social development, outcomes depend on the quality of a child-care center and on the authors' interpretation of a certain behavior as problematic or socially competent. Preschool programs targeted to very disadvantaged children obtained high rates of return as they managed to significantly improve life chances of their participants, while universal programs' potential rate of return has been only roughly estimated and there is no an unambiguous answer as to whether do they produce an economic return on invested means.

(English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] U radu se razmatra institucionalizirani predÅ¡kolski odgoj i obrazovanje kroz pregled postojeÄih istraÅ¾ivanja o utjecajima pohaÄanja predÅ¡kolskih ustanova na kognitivni i socijalni razvoj djeteta te kroz pregled analiza troÅ¡kova i koristi programa ranog razvoja za djecu slabijeg socio-ekonomskog statusa. PohaÄanje predÅ¡kolskih ustanova pozitivno je utjecalo na kognitivni razvoj djeteta u smislu bolje pripremljenosti polaznika za Å¡kolu, pri Äemu se posebno istiÄe vaÅ¾nost kognitivno usmjerenog kurikuluma i veliÄine grupe. U pogledu socijalnog razvoja ishodi su ovisili o kvaliteti predÅ¡kolske ustanove te o tome jesu li sami autori tumaÄili odreÄeno ponaÅ¡anje kao problematiÄno ili kao socijalno kompetentno. PredÅ¡kolski programi ciljani na djecu vrlo slabog socio-ekonomskog statusa poluÄili su visoke stope povrata jer su proizveli znaÄajne promjene u Å¾ivotnim Å¡ansama polaznika, dok su za univerzalne programe u literaturi izraÄene tek procjene te nema jedinstvenog odgovora o tome proizvode li ekonomski povrat uloÅ¾enih sredstava.

AB  - This brief summarizes findings on class size from over 25 years of work on the Tennessee Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) randomized, longitudinal experiment, and other Class-Size Reduction (CSR) studies throughout the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Sweden, Great Britain, and elsewhere. The brief concludes with recommendations. The STAR research shows that small classes (15-17 pupils) in kindergarten through third grade (K-3) provide short- and long-term benefits for students, teachers, and society at large. Although all students benefit; poor, minority, and male students reap extra benefits in terms of improved test outcomes, school engagement, and reduced grade retention and dropout rates. Differing formulas for counting students and teachers are a major impediment to understanding and using small classes correctly: a pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) is a division problem, class size is an addition problem. The two are not the same, and thus PTR data cannot be used as a substitute for actual class-size data. (Contains 2 tables, 4 resources and 13 footnotes.)

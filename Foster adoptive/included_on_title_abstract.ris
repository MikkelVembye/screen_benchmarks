AB  - The Fostering Attachments Group (Golding, 2006) is a group intervention combining social learning theory and attachment theory to inform the parenting of looked after children who present a wide range of emotional and behavioural difficulties. Evaluations to date have consistently found high rates of satisfaction from participants and a greater understanding of the child's needs, but only limited impact on the child's behaviour. Identifying the mechanisms of change in these well-received groups, Ben Gurney-Smith therefore, seems important. Ben Gurney-Smith, Charlotte Granger Anna Randle and Jenny Fletcher report on a novel evaluation of this group using, for the first time, a mixed group of foster carers and adoptive parents, with measures repeated at pre-, post- and three- month follow-up, and consistent with both theoretical models. The group was rated highly for satisfaction and sustained improvements were found in the caregiver's understanding and the perceived difficulties of the child. Significant positive and sustained changes were found in specific behavioural difficulties named by the caregiver, the child's hyperactivity and in the caregiver's mind-mindedness when they perceived a break in the relationship with their child. The study supports the use of measures capturing change over time in both the child and caregiver, which are consistent with both theoretical approaches used within the group.

AB  - Central to the success of therapeutic foster care (TFC) is the quality and stability of the relationship between the child and carer. This key relationship may, from a therapeutic perspective, facilitate healing by addressing the impact of complex developmental trauma experienced by the child who has been placed in care. Stability of the carer–child relationship is critical in this context. Therapeutic carers have been shown to be significantly more likely to remain in the role of carer than their counterparts in mainstream foster care. The research reported on in this paper draws upon findings from an evaluation of a TFC programme and gives voice to the Circle Carers, presenting the components of TFC which are important to them. The paper commences with the story of Ruby in TFC as told by a carer. The focus then becomes a detailed exploration of the experience of carers and their capacity to care. Implications for practice are identified.

AB  - Preventing the negative impact of maltreatment on children's mental health requires interventions to be contextually sensitive, grounded in theory and research, and effective in reaching and retaining children and families. This study replicates and extends previous findings of the Fostering Healthy Futures (FHF) program, a 30-week mentoring and skills group intervention for preadolescent maltreated children in foster care. Participants included 426 children recently placed in out-of-home care who were randomized to intervention or control conditions. Outcomes measured 6-10 months postintervention included a multi-informant (child, caregiver, teacher) index of mental health problems as well as measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms, dissociative symptoms, quality of life, and use of mental health services and psychotropic medications. There were high rates of program initiation, retention, and engagement; 95% of those randomized to FHF started the program, 92% completed it, and over 85% of the mentoring visits and skills groups were attended. The FHF program demonstrated significant impact in reducing mental health symptomatology, especially trauma symptoms, and mental health service utilization. These program effects were consistent across almost all subgroups, suggesting that FHF confers benefit for diverse children. Results indicate that positive youth development programming is highly acceptable to children and families and that it can positively impact trauma and its sequelae.

AB  - This study assessed the executive functioning and behavioral self-regulation of 7-11 year-old adopted children via parent interview, behavior rating forms, and computerized neuropsychological testing. It was predicted that early relationship adversity would be associated with deficits in neuropsychological functioning, such that children who experienced instability and maltreatment would demonstrate below average performance on tasks of executive functioning. Results indicated that adopted children performed more poorly than the standardization sample on computerized tasks of executive function. Although early relationship adversity was not a significant predictor of performance on computerized tasks of executive function, it was a significant predictor of adopted children's behavioral self-regulation problems as assessed by parent behavior rating instruments. Specifically, early relationship adversity was associated with poor inhibitory control, inattention, aggression, rule-breaking behaviors, and working memory difficulties. Children's executive functioning problems were also associated with high levels of parenting stress and low levels of parental acceptance. Findings provide information about aspects of early care that can place children at risk for developing executive functioning and self-regulatory deficits. This study may have implications for interventions and policy regarding adopted children and their caregivers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Reviews the book, A Practical Guide to Caring for Children and Teenagers with Attachment Difficulties by C. Taylor (2010). This book is a resource for practitioners that is aimed at professionals working with, and living alongside troubled children such as residential and foster carers. It has been written by an author with a wealth of practice experience in this area. The book presents a therapeutic approach that is underpinned by an understanding of how attachment relationships influence the emotional, cognitive and behavioral development of them. The approach is a behavioral one in the sense that attachment theory describes patterns of organized behavior within a relationship, and the outlined strategies for working with children are focused on managing their behavior. The book gives a rich and detailed account of how attachment difficulties in early life impact on future development and offers practical guidance on how to work with children in a way that mitigates these past difficulties and helps them recover. The book is divided into eight chapters. The first chapter is called 'Patterns of Attachment' and outlines an understanding of attachment that is based around the theory of John Bowlby and the experimental research of Mary Ainsworth. The remaining seven chapters take different aspects of a therapeutic mode based around working with a child who has a negative Internal Working Model (IWM) to develop a positive one, by creating an environment in which the child can develop secure attachments. This book explores the impact of attachment difficulties on the behavior of young people and offers a therapeutic framework and approach to care that attempts to address this behavior. It offers a valuable resource to practitioners who work directly with young people, providing them with a strategy and practical tools to manage difficult behavior in a way that supports young people and ensures their recovery.

AB  - Mentalization-based interventions show promise in improving mental health outcomes for children and parents through increasing a family's reflective functioning, or ability to mentalize. Mentalizing involves the ability to understand behavior in relation to mental states, such as thoughts and feelings, and typically develops within the context of secure attachment relationships. One area not given much consideration when training foster parents is their capacity to mentalize. This study evaluated Family Minds, a newly developed psychoeducational intervention for foster parents, designed to increase their ability to mentalize. The current paper reports on the development and preliminary empirical evaluation of Family Minds in a quasi-experimental study where 102 foster parents received either Family Minds or a typical foster parenting class, which served as a control group. Results indicate that parents who received Family Minds significantly increased their levels of reflective functioning as assessed with the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire and a new Five-Minute Speech Sample procedure coded using the Reflective Functioning Scale, and revealed a tendency to show decreased levels of parenting stress on the Parenting Stress Index, while the control group showed no such improvements. These findings support the hypothesis that a short-term psychoeducational intervention may improve foster parents' ability to mentalize themselves and their children. These skills are very beneficial for foster parents, as they frequently deal with children who come into their home with challenging behaviors, attachment issues, and negative internal working models of relationships. This type of intervention has the potential to lower placement breakdowns and improve the mental health of foster children.

AB  - As outlined in earlier chapters, phase or stage-oriented trauma treatment models are becoming more prominent and widely accepted. Most focus on establishing stability, integrating traumatic memories among children in care to reduce the impact of the trauma, consolidating personal and interpersonal growth to return to a normal developmental trajectory, and forming more secure attachment relationships. Conceptually, Resource Parent Curriculum (RPC) is a workshop that maps best onto the integration phase of trauma treatments supporting the permanency goals within the child welfare umbrella of services. RPC teaches parents what they need to know about how adverse childhood experiences impact a child’s perception of adults and the world. Parents also learn about how to shift their own thinking to better understand challenging child behaviors and look at these behaviors through a 'trauma lens.' Parents who participate in RPC groups learn about and practice key skills to attend to children, minimize their reactivity to issues common in children who have experienced trauma, and support the overall goal to maximize placement stability in the home to trauma, RPC can provide them with skills and supports to help advocate for comprehensive trauma-focused assessments, selection of treatments that will best address the concerns identified in the assessment, and for regular involvement of tae caregiver in the treatment to monitor and maintain progress once connected to a provider.

AB  - This study examined measures of placement stability and social–emotional well-being for a federally-funded demonstration project of inhome Parent Management Training-Oregon model (PMTO) for children in foster care with serious emotional disturbance (SED). Following a cultural exchange framework for translational research and a tollgate approach to evaluation, this formative study tested these measures prior to further investment in summative evaluation. The research aim was to observe whether measures of social–emotional well-being and placement stability performed as expected. Using a pretest–posttest randomized consent trial, children identified as SED within six months of entering foster care were randomly assigned to PMTO or to a services-as-usual comparison group ( N = 121). A multi-group structural equation model was tested to observe the relationship of baseline social–emotional wellbeing and placement stability on post-test social–emotional well-being. Results showed that post-test well-being was significantly predicted by baseline well-being for both groups and, importantly, only the intervention group demonstrated significant effects of placement stability on post-test well-being. For the intervention group, as placement stability increased, post-test social skills significantly improved, demonstrating an association between well-being and placement stability that was not evident in the comparison group. Overall, wellbeing measures performed as expected and detected relationships between variables and variation as hypothesized. Additionally, placement stability may have been mediated by the PMTO intervention. In conclusion, by using a real world example of the translational research concept of cultural exchange between university-based researchers and agency-based practitioners, this study shows that formative evaluation offers an important opportunity to test ad hoc research questions inspired by the process of implementation itself.

AB  - This study examined changes in parenting practices among parents receiving Parent Management Training Oregon model (PMTO). These parents had children in foster care with serious emotional disturbance and were randomized to receive in-home PMTO for up to six months. Using data from the Parent Child Checklist, an observation-based measure administered by therapists after each parent-child session, latent growth curve modeling was conducted with a sample of 318 parents of children, aged 3–16 years old, in foster care. Results showed that overall parenting effectiveness improved and that the change trajectory was best fit by a cubic model (two changes in trajectory). Parenting effectiveness initially increased but was found to turn downward temporarily, then rebounded toward additional improvements. Similarly, three of the six subscales – skill encouragement, positive involvement, and communication/monitoring – demonstrated significant change and a cubic trajectory. In contrast, problem solving and effective discipline subscales showed significant improvement but the trajectory was best fit by a quadratic model, indicating that these parenting practices improved and then leveled off near the end of treatment. The ineffective discipline subscale did not demonstrate significant change. Additionally, parents with high initial scores experienced lower rates of improvement and higher rates of deceleration. However, parents who started with relatively high rates of change were better able to maintain improvements over time. Overall, the results suggested PMTO was associated with increased effective parenting but the trajectory for positive change included both gains and setbacks. Future research is needed to determine whether gains in parenting practices are sustained beyond the treatment period.

AB  - Although parental substance abuse has been identified as a risk factor for poor foster care outcomes, current research on effective interventions is limited. A few studies have shown that parenting interventions improved parenting skills and family functioning and decreased time to reunification among children in foster care due to parental substance abuse. However, more research is needed to evaluate whether these interventions positively impact reentry rates. Using propensity score analyses to establish a matched comparison group, survival analyses evaluated the relationship between participation in a parenting intervention, the Strengthening Families Program (SFP), and reentry among a sample of 493 children previously reunified with their parents. The overall reentry rate was 20.9%. Analyses indicated that there was no difference in reentry rates between the SFP (23.7%) and comparison groups (18.6%). Significant predictors of reentry were child behavior problems, family poverty, and reunification between 15 and 18 months from removal.

AB  - Child welfare have historically experienced high dropout rates. As evidence-based interventions (EBIs) spread to the child welfare field, treatment noncompletion could interfere with successful outcomes. Using a mixed methods approach, this study investigated the differences between completers and noncompleters, and reasons for treatment noncompletion of an EBI for families of children in foster care. The sample comprised 315 families randomized to receive Parent Management Training, Oregon Model (PMTO). Researchers examined clinicians' discharge notes to explore reasons for noncompletion. Using data collected from a battery of assessments, bivariate logistic regression compared completers and noncompleters on demographics, socioeconomic factors, children's social-emotional functioning, and parents' functioning. About one third of families were noncompleters. Single fathers and parents with lower socioeconomic status were more likely to drop out. By contrast, parents with lower functioning on child behavior and parenting trended toward higher completion rates. Formidable challenges were parental substance abuse and mental illness. Results suggest parent training may require tailoring for specific subgroups and pairing with strategies for enhancing early engagement and reducing treatment barriers. Future research is needed to include parents' views on noncompletion and to more closely examine the influence of specific factors, such as severity of parental mental illness and substance abuse.

AB  - Abstract Evidence-supported parenting interventions (ESPIs) increasingly are used in child welfare to improve child well-being and parenting. However, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of ESPIs with biological families of children in foster care with serious behavioral health problems. To address this gap in the literature, we examined the outcomes of in-home Parent Management Training Oregon model (PMTO). PMTO was evaluated in a randomized trial in which 918 children were assigned to PMTO or services as usual with assessment at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Outcome domains included child social-emotional well-being, parenting, and caregiver functioning. Our results show PMTO demonstrated linear improvements in children's social-emotional functioning, problem behaviors, and social skills. Although results for parenting were inconclusive, two of four caregiver functioning outcomes (parent mental health and readiness for reunification) were significantly improved. Overall, these findings suggest PMTO and similar ESPIs may hold promise for promoting better outcomes for biological families of children in foster care with behavioral health problems. Highlights • All child social-emotional well-being outcomes showed linear improvement. • Results for parenting practices were inconclusive due to measurement issues. • 2 of 4 caregiver outcomes improved – mental health and readiness for reunification.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the effects of Parent Management Training, Oregon (PMTO) model on parenting effectiveness and caregiver functioning. Method: Children in foster care with emotional and behavioral problems were randomized to PMTO (n = 461) or services as usual (n = 457) in a nonblinded study design. Using an intent-to-treat approach, analysis of covariance models tested the intervention’s overall effect and time interactions for parenting and caregiver functioning. Additional analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of outcomes. Results: PMTO did not significantly affect parenting practices; however, positive effects were observed on caregiver functioning in mental health (odds ratio [OR] = 2.01), substance use (OR = 1.67), social supports (OR = 2.37), and readiness for reunification (OR = 1.64). While no time interactions were detected, several child, parent, and case characteristics were associated with improvements in 6-month outcomes. Conclusion: This study extends evidence on PMTO to biological families of children in foster care, including those with older youth.

AB  - Evidence-supported parenting interventions (ESPIs) have expanded into child welfare because a growing research base has demonstrated positive results among children with serious emotional and behavioral problems. Despite a clear federal policy emphasis on reunification, few randomized trials have tested ESPIs with biological families of children in foster care; even fewer studies have investigated the distal outcomes of ESPIs. The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of Parent Management Training, Oregon (PMTO) model on reunification. Children in foster care with emotional and behavioral problems were randomized to in-home PMTO ( n = 461) or services as usual (SAU) ( n = 457). Cox regression models tested whether children in the PMTO group achieved higher rates of reunification. We applied life tables data for integrals calculations to estimate days saved in foster care. Analyses were conducted as intent-to-treat (ITT), and per protocol analysis (PPA). ITT results showed reunification rates were 6.9% higher for the PMTO group (62.7%) than the SAU group (55.8%) with 151 days saved per typical child. PPA indicated that intervention completion strengthened effects as PMTO completers’ reunification rates (69.5%) were 13.7% higher than the SAU group (55.8%), and were 15.3% higher than non-completers (54.2%). Days saved were also greater for completers as compared to the SAU group (299 days) and non-completers (358 days). Overall, findings suggest that an in-home parenting intervention positively affected reunification as delivered to biological parents of children and youth in foster care with serious emotional and behavioral problems. Implications and future considerations for research are discussed.

AB  - Objective: This study tested the effectiveness of Parent Management Training, Oregon (PMTO) model on child social–emotional well-being. Methods: Using a randomized controlled design and three measures of social–emotional well-being, the study investigated effectiveness of PMTO with families of children in foster care with serious emotional disturbance (SED). Participants included children (3–16 years) and parents who were randomly assigned to PMTO (n = 461) or services as usual (n = 457). Study condition was known to participants and assessors. Six months after baseline, analysis of covariance models examined the intervention’s overall effect and time interactions using intent-to-treat analysis. Follow-up analyses identified salient predictors of well-being. Results: PMTO demonstrated small but significant positive effects on three primary outcomes: social–emotional functioning (Cohen’s d = .31), problem behaviors (Cohen’s d = .09), and prosocial skills (Cohen’s d = .09). Conclusion: Results suggest that PMTO was effective at improving short-term social–emotional well-being in a high-risk population of children with SED.

AB  - The editorial presents the issues involved in the parental couple relationship in child and adolescent mental health. In this editorial, the author would particularly like to draw the reader’s attention to the latter part of this quote and briefly consider its implications. It is author's intention to raise the profile of couple work in a work context which has historically not been inclusive of couple therapy or couple work into their service provision. From my experience as the Lead of the Family Therapy Department in a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in the United Kingdom, it has become clear that we ought to include working with the couple relationship more often, if not as standard in the practice. In order to effectively work with children, one needs to take account of their environment. The first and immediate environment is the home environment. This home environment may consist of the biological parents, a step-parent or an adoptive parenting couple or even foster carers. The final two family constellations may have some specific issues attached to them, but essentially in order. There are some systemic frameworks that acknowledge the importance of attending to the couple relationship in family therapy; Attachment-Based Family Therapy.

AB  - Jeanette Allen and Panos Vostanis describe the set-up and preliminary evaluation of a seven-week training programme for foster carers and supervising social workers based on attachment theory. It has long been recognised that parenting children with complex and challenging needs in a family setting is extremely demanding, with research indicating that foster carers' lack of confidence in managing such demands is a significant factor in placement breakdown. This study suggests that attachment theory provides a useful model to help carers understand and respond to the complex difficulties presented by children with a history of abuse and trauma, and that the provision of a conceptual framework may be a significant factor in improving foster carers' confidence to manage the difficulties presented by the children in their care. The clinical implications of this evaluation are discussed.

AB  - This chapter provides case vignettes of abused children and foster parents who have experienced difficulties after the child has been placed in the foster or adoptive home. Interventions and support for these families is discussed. Many children entering local authority care have been traumatized within the context of an attachment relationship. Helping such children develop new powerful attachment relationships is therefore a vital component in the resolution of their early experiences, but the needs of both parties in the relationship must be considered. Supporting foster carers and adoptive parents relating to children who resist new relationship experiences is fundamental in helping the children make developmental progress. Providing day-to-day parenting skills is one element of this support, but the needs of carers or parents suggest that support should be more comprehensive, including a conceptual framework to understand the child and an opportunity for carers or parents to reflect on their own emotional issues and their impact on the dyadic relationship.

AB  - Children with histories of child abuse and neglect, particularly children residing in foster or adoptive homes, are commonly considered by many professionals to need 'attachment therapy' in order to address emotional and behavioral needs. However, evidence-based treatments rarely utilize an attachment-based justification outside of the infancy through preschooler age range. In actuality, many evidence-based treatments can be understood through the lens of attachment theory. This paper reviews the tenets of an attachment-based approach to treatment and describes how one evidence-based treatment, Parent–Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), conforms to all expectations and requirements prescribed by attachment theory and research. Next, pilot data from an open trial of PCIT with a sample of adopted children and their adoptive caregivers (n = 85) are provided. Results demonstrate significant improvements in positive parenting techniques, reductions in parenting stress, and reductions in externalizing and internalizing concerns among the children. These results are discussed in the context of improving the quality of care for children often described as in need of 'attachment therapy.'

AB  - In the United States, approximately 400,000 children reside in foster care, and most have been exposed to caregiver abuse, neglect, or abandonment. A majority of foster children suffer the effects of damaging circumstances including poverty, violence, inferior health care, and substandard housing. Consequently, young foster youth frequently struggle to accomplish developmental tasks such as establishing secure attachment relationships, cultivating pre-academic skills, and acquiring social-emotional competence. The purpose of this research was to determine the impact of Peace4Kids, a nonprofit community-based organization, on young foster youths' social-emotional development and pre-academic skills. Data collected from parents, teachers, and administrators during semi-structured interviews documented children's experiences as they attended the organization's Saturday Core Program. Participants noted that as foster children participated in a variety of curricular and co-curricular experiences at Peace4Kids, their social, emotional, and academic development were positively impacted. Parents, teachers, and administrators reported that the organization's culture of consistency, trust, and accountability promoted secure attachment relationships among foster youth, staff members, and peers at the Saturday Core Program. Participants iterated that secure relationships provided a foundation for foster children to subsequently acquire social and emotional capacities, including persistence, conflict resolution, self-regulation, and autonomy. As youth in foster care developed social-emotional competencies, pre-academic skills such as literacy and numeracy emerged. This study's findings indicate that a comprehensive approach is necessary to address the unique needs of foster children who have experienced prior trauma. Additionally, this research study contributes to a growing body of work that explores the role of attachment relationships in group and organizational settings.

AB  - Professionals in the child trauma field, eager to bring best practices to children and their families who have suffered from traumatic life events, have developed a number of evidence-based treatments (EBTs) and promising practices available for adoption and implementation into community practice. Clinicians and researchers alike have raised questions about “if, when, and how” these EBTs can be applied to some of the more complex trauma presentations seen in real world practice. The authors take an evidence-based practice approach, including critical appraisal of clients' unique needs and preferences, utilizing applicable trauma treatment core components and current EBTs, and emphasizing monitoring strategies of client progress, particularly when needing to adapt EBTs for select clients.

AB  - Because of the newness of post-legal adoption services, very little research exists regarding the effectiveness of services (Barth and Miller, 2000). This program evaluation presentation provides a brief overview of post-adoptive services to over 200 families involved in a federally funded project, in addition to information on programming for families who adopt high-risk children. Three years of qualitative and quantitative results provide evidence of the effectiveness of this project.

AB  - Attachment issues in foster care are examined with special focus on preschool children. Children in foster care are at risk for psychological problems, due to their experiences with adverse life conditions. Attachment theory can give useful contributions to understanding developmental processes for foster children, where secure attachment is acknowledged as a protective factor. However, research indicates that there can be difficulties for children who are placed in foster care after 12-18 months of age, to form secure attachments. Their previous attachment experiences have a strong impact in forming new relationships. In many cases there is a need for interventions that directly target the forming of attachments in foster care. Research concerning treatment approaches is outlined in the article. A clinical case is presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate mental health and resilience in adolescents who have been internationally adopted and their non-adopted peers and examine the potential interaction between adoption status and resilience on mental health problems. Data from the population based youth@hordaland-survey, conducted in Hordaland County, Norway, in 2012 was used. In all, 10 257 adolescents aged 16-19 years provided self-reported data on several mental health instruments. Of these, 45 adolescents were identified as internationally adopted. Adoptees reported more symptoms of depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and perfectionism than non-adopted adolescents, but there were no differences regarding resilience. Adolescents with higher resilience scores reported fewer symptoms of mental health problems, however, no interaction effects were found for adoption status and total resilience score on measures of mental health problems. Our findings indicate that knowledge of resilience factors can form the basis for preventive interventions.

AB  - The experience of being removed from one's home and the transition to a residential care system pose enormous challenges for a child. Substantial evidence has been found regarding severe developmental effects due to early exposition to extreme psychosocial and affective deprivation. The research on Bowlby's theoretical proposals has highlighted the link between insecure, disorganized and atypical attachment patterns and children both living in foster care facilities and adopted out of those institutions. The goal of this pilot study is to investigate the attachment representation in an Italian sample of children in middle childhood (9-13 years old) who have been removed from their homes. Method Two compared groups of children participated in this study. The first group was composed of 24 Italian children who had been removed from their homes. The second group, considered as the control group, was composed of 35 Italian children who had never been in foster care placement. The quality of children's attachment to their primary caregivers was assessed by the Child Attachment Interview, an innovative semi-structured interview that seeks to bridge the measurement gap identified in middle childhood Results The children in foster care placement show a higher percentage of insecure and disorganized attachment representations and lower scores on the Child Reflective Functioning Scale. Conclusions The clinical implications and enhancements to effective intervention for foster children's caretaking are discussed. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This mixed methods study examined foster and adoptive parents' experience of an attachment-based psychoeducational course. A semi-structured qualitative interview explored parent perceptions of the course content and the impact of the course on parental stress levels, parent-child interactions, and child behavior in a sample of parent participants, after parents completed the 8-week Attachment Security Course. Prior to and following completion of the course parents completed quantitative measures of parenting stress, parent-child interaction, and child behavior. Due to the small sample size, the quantitative results were not interpretable in aggregate form. Emphasis was placed on the qualitative data to gather information about participants' experience. As the research process progressed a secondary product emerged, a special topics in parenting guide for therapists working from an Attachment Security intervention framework. The results of this study, combined with the literature and clinical experience of providing an Attachment Security Course for Veteran parents were used to generate the guide.

AB  - Children in foster placement often experience a variety of social and emotional problems that stem from their history of being abused or neglected and from the disruption of being placed in foster care. These problems and the transience of their home life in the foster care system can have a powerful impact on their ability to function in school. This article describes programs designed to help foster children by expediting and advocating for appropriate school placement academic tutoring, counseling, coordination of services, and guidance toward independent living. These programs have been evaluated and found to be very effective in aiding placement of children in appropriate school programs promptly, facilitating academic progress, and helping students successfully graduate from high school. Providing this group of high-risk students with appropriate guidance and services can be a very cost-effective method of preventing future social problems associated with school failure and dropout.

AB  - This study evaluated the new online Emotional Attachment and Emotional Availability (EA2) Intervention for use with adoptive families in enhancing parent–child EA, parental perceptions of EA, child attachment behaviors, parent–child emotional attachment, and reducing parent‐reported child behavioral problems and parenting‐related stress. Participants in this study were adoptive parents and their adopted children ages 1.5 to 5 years old (N = 15 dyads). Participants were placed in an immediate intervention group (IG) or a delayed intervention group (DG) that would receive the 6‐week EA2 Tele‐Intervention after the IG. Results revealed significant differences in the IG in child behavioral problems, parent–child EA, parental perceptions of EA, and parent–child emotional attachment, improvements not seen in the DG. Analysis of effects of the DG after receiving the EA2 Tele‐Intervention revealed significant differences over time also in most of these qualities.

AB  - It is well established that looked after children are more likely to develop complex behavioural and emotional difficulties that can leave many carers struggling to help and understand the child. This can lead to the breakdown of placements whereby the lack of placement stability leaves the child even more vulnerable. The Family Minds (FM) psycho-educational and interactive programme is a newly developed intervention for groups of foster and adoptive parents. It lasts for nine hours and comprises elements of mentalisation-based family therapy, lectures, group exercises and homework, with the aim that parents will be able to better understand and support their fostered or adopted child through increased reflective functioning. In a study undertaken in Texas we evaluated whether there was a change in the parents’ reflective functioning (verbal mentalisation) pre- to post-FM training compared to a comparison group who experienced a ‘treatment as usual’ intervention comprising four hours of lecture information about trauma and attachment. Using five-minute speech samples pre- and post-training, we coded whether the capacity to think reflectively about oneself and one’s child altered in either training group. We found that, unlike the comparison group, parents in the FM group significantly increased their reflective functioning. This outcome was independent of several factors such as the age of the parent, age of the child and time as a carer. The only factor influencing the significant change was the training group in which the parent was placed. These findings suggest that this novel mentalisation-based psycho-educational training programme can successfully increase parents’ reflective functioning which, in turn, should enhance and strengthen the understanding and relationship between the foster/adoptive parent and the child and reduce negative outcomes.

AB  - Foster parents in nontraditional foster care programs receive more extensive, ongoing training and support than foster parents in traditional foster care programs. This study examined whether differences exist in the levels of perceived parenting stress, satisfaction, and efficacy among traditional and nontraditional foster parents. Twenty-four foster parents completed the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) and the Parenting Sense of Competence scale (PSOC). Nontraditional foster parents reported higher levels of overall parenting stress and lower levels of foster parent role satisfaction than did traditional foster parents. However, response profiles indicated that nontraditional foster parents had children with more emotional and behavioral problems than traditional foster parents, which likely impacted stress and satisfaction scores. Qualitative information regarding foster parent perceptions was collected through phone interviews with 12 participants. Traditional foster parents reported low levels of agency satisfaction and frustration with inadequate support, while nontraditional foster parents reported satisfaction with type and amount of support and training. Implications of the findings and recommendations for nontraditional foster care communities, traditional foster care programs, and foster care professionals are discussed.

AB  - This study was designed to add to our knowledge about the impact of intensive case management (ICM) on the level of functioning of severely emotionally disturbed (SED) adolescents in out-of-home care. Three hypotheses were tested in this research: SED adolescents receiving ICM, after six months of intervention, would (1) demonstrate a higher level of social competence and a greater decrease in behavioral/emotional problems, (2) a higher level of school functioning, and (3) a higher level of residential functioning than SED adolescents receiving foster care case management (FCCM). The participants in the study were 71 adolescents in the custody of the South Carolina Department of Social Services who, (1) were in out-of-home placement and (2) met the CASSP criteria for SED. The study used a field based, experimental design with simple random assignment to two treatment groups--intensive case management (ICM) and foster care case management (FCCM). ICM was clearly defined and operationalized and multiple measures of outcomes were used at both the system and interpersonal level. The Youth Self-Report was used to measure the adolescents' levels of social competence and behavioral/emotional problems. Over the six months of the intervention, data were collected on the factors associated with the population, case managers, the treatment intervention, and the interrelationship among these factors. Analysis revealed that the majority of the adolescents were diagnosed with character disorder or attention deficit disorder, had spent extensive time in foster care, and were placed in residential treatment facilities. The primary case management activity was monitoring, followed by assessment and planning. The findings provided evidence that ICM adolescents achieved a higher level of social functioning and moved to less restrictive residential placements than those adolescents receiving FCCM. Implications for social work practice, research, and education are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: Caring for children in foster or adoptive care with behavioral health needs can severely stress parents, contributing to adverse outcomes for children and families. Trauma-informed services from the child welfare and mental health sectors may help prevent poor outcomes by helping children and parents identify and understand trauma and its impact on children’s behavioral health and receive effective treatment. To help understand the role of trauma-informed services for the child welfare population, we examined whether trauma-informed child welfare and mental health services moderated the relationship between children’s behavioral health needs and parent satisfaction and commitment. Method: The researchers analyzed data from a cross-sectional statewide survey of foster and adoptive parents (n = 512 respondents, 42% of 1,206 contacted) from one state. Results: Foster (but not adoptive) parent ratings of trauma-informed mental health services significantly moderated the relationship between children’s behavioral health needs and foster and adoptive parent satisfaction and commitment. As ratings of trauma-informed mental health services increased, the association between child behavioral health needs and parent satisfaction and commitment became nonsignificant, suggesting a buffering effect. Trauma-informed child welfare services did not moderate the relationship for foster or adoptive parents. Conclusions: Leaders and policymakers are urged to promote trauma-informed mental health services for children involved with child welfare to potentially buffer foster parents against lower parenting satisfaction and commitment. More research is needed to replicate and expand on these findings and to examine the effectiveness of trauma-informed services on other relevant child and family outcomes.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of a newly integrated version of an intervention targeting adoptive mothers' positive parenting for promoting children's emotional availability, by testing the moderating role of both two maternal genetic polymorphisms (i.e., 5HTTLPR and DRD4-VNTR) and emotional availability-EA on intervention outcomes. Mothers with their children (N = 80; M-age = 42.73 years, SD = 3.79; M-age = 33.18 months, SD = 16.83 months) participated in a RCT testing the Video-Feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline-VIPP-FC/A effectiveness. Mixed effects regression models showed a significant improvement in mother-child EA for the VIPP-intervention vs. the dummy intervention condition, with a moderating role of maternal EA on children's outcomes. No significant moderating effect was found for the two genetic polymorphisms inquired. Children's and mother's outcomes obtained are discussed.

AB  - Parenting interventions represent a means for experimentally inquiring socio‐emotional change of post‐institutionalized children after adoption. We used this approach in a three time point RCT study involving 83 post‐institutionalized children (Mage = 33.5 months, SD = 17.1) and their adoptive mothers (Mage = 42.6, SD = 3.9), attending either the Video‐Feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting in adoption and foster care or a dummy intervention. Controlling for gender and age at adoption, children showed a significant change in their socio‐emotional adjustment in the specific variables inquired—that is, emotional availability‐EA, and behavioral problems—after intervention attendance. Mediation and moderated mediation models showed that maternal EA was a main factor affecting children's EA and externalizing behavioral problems, with a key moderating role played by children's temperament; children with high scores on temperamental negative affect benefitted most from their mothers' increase in EA.

AB  - While adoptions in general are highly successful, families do experience disappointment and disruption, outcomes that may be reduced by provision of post-adoption services. Studies show that adoptive parents request a variety of services, yet few demonstration projects have been done to evaluate their effectiveness. In this paper, the authors recognize the predominance of attachment theory in post-adoptive services and identify alternative approaches that may have a better fit with the needs and preferences identified by families. They also identify service adaptations for adoptive families that may amplify the power of existing service programs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Trauma exposure is pervasive among children living in foster care, and yet most resource parents (foster parents and kinship caregivers), child welfare staff, and others in the child welfare system are not adequately prepared to recognize and respond effectively when children exhibit trauma symptoms. Trauma-systems Therapy-Foster Care (TST-FC) is a systemwide model of trauma-informed care focused on meeting the emotional needs of children in foster care who have experienced traumatic events. This study evaluated the implementation of TST-FC in two state child welfare agencies that included training for staff ( n = 123) and resource parents ( n = 111). Study findings show training participants had positive perceptions of TST-FC and found it useful. TST-FC also was associated with significant increases in trauma-informed parenting and tolerance of children's misbehavior by resource parents, as well as more trauma-informed policies and practices in the child welfare agencies. Training participants reported that TST-FC provided useful tools and a common language about trauma that enhanced their capacity to collaborate with one another and manage children's difficult behavior. An exploratory study of resource home retention and children's placement stability revealed fewer foster home closures and placement disruptions when resource parents were trained in TST-FC compared to homes not trained in the model. The results of this study suggest that TST-FC is a promising model for increasing the capacity of child welfare agencies to provide trauma-informed care to children and families in the foster care system.

AB  - Child abuse remains a serious and expensive social problem in the United States. Few evidence-based treatments (EBTs) exist for at-risk families and/or maltreating families where neglect or abuse has occurred, limiting the ability of social service agencies to comply with legislative mandates to use EBTs with clients. One promising intervention, parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT), has been tested in 11 separate trials with this population. This review of research on PCIT with abusive adults found that overall PCIT is an appropriate, efficacious intervention method to prevent future maltreatment by targeting parenting skills and child externalizing behaviors. These findings must be taken with caution, since the key factor to determine efficacy is completion of treatment, and all the studies involved showed significant problems with sample attrition. While the current studies are promising, there is a need for research that focuses on measuring parental sensitivity and attachment levels, explores use in the foster and adoptive communities, and studies that use tertiary subjects to serve as unbiased reporters of perceived levels of behavioral changes.

AB  - The current study is based on naturalistic data consisting of parents’ and teachers’ observations in the child’s natural environment. Such studies are more likely to capture naturally occurring behaviors. The goal of this study id to compare behaviors of previously institutionalized and non-institutionalized Romanian foster children with normative data for non referred children derived from the Romanian language version of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment manual. The Romanian normative data for both the CBCL/6–18 and TRF were based on a large Romanian sample. Socio-cultural characteristics for these comparative Romanian studies are not available. Using other archival data that we have obtained regarding the same Romanian foster children, we would like to pursue the following lines of research the future. First, we would like to assess children’s behavior regarding the different pathways they followed as they were moved among various institutions (e.g. nurseries, maternity wards and residential placement centers) within the Romanian child welfare system. Second, we plan to explore the relationship between foster parents’ psychological characteristics and their foster children’s emotional and behavioral development. Finally, we plan to explore the effects of rationale emotive behavior therapy on the Romanian foster parents’ perception of their own parenting behaviors.

AB  - Despite the tremendous mental health need evidenced by children in foster care and high rates of use of mental health services among children in foster care, little is known about the impact of outpatient mental health services on the behavioral health of this population. This study utilizes data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW), the first nationally representative study of child welfare in the United States. A subsample of 439 children who have experienced long-term foster care were included in this study. These data were used to estimate the impact of outpatient mental health services on the externalizing and internalizing behavior problems of children in long-term foster care. A propensity score matching model was employed to produce a robust estimate of the treatment effect. Results indicate that children who have experienced long-term foster care do not benefit from the receipt of outpatient mental health services. Study results are discussed in the context of earlier research on the quality of mental health services for children in foster care. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - We examined caregiver report of externalizing behavior from 12 to 54 months of age in 102 children randomized to care as usual in institutions or to newly created high-quality foster care. At baseline no differences by group or genotype in externalizing were found. However, changes in externalizing from baseline to 42 months of age were moderated by the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region genotype and intervention group, where the slope for short–short (S/S) individuals differed as a function of intervention group. The slope for individuals carrying the long allele did not significantly differ between groups. At 54 months of age, S/S children in the foster care group had the lowest levels of externalizing behavior, while children with the S/S genotype in the care as usual group demonstrated the highest rates of externalizing behavior. No intervention group differences were found in externalizing behavior among children who carried the long allele. These findings, within a randomized controlled trial of foster care compared to continued care as usual, indicate that the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region genotype moderates the relation between early caregiving environments to predict externalizing behavior in children exposed to early institutional care in a manner most consistent with differential susceptibility.

AB  - The first part of this article was devoted to the evaluation of the prevalence of different types of child maltreatment and their long-term consequences in children; here we conducted a literature review of studies evaluating the efficacy of medico-social interventions in these children. A better recognition of cases remains a major issue for improving the current system of reporting, the factors associated with delayed or no reporting was underlined in different reviews, and several proposals have been made to remedy, as professional training focus on warning signs. If psychological support can take different forms depending on the clinical context, encouraging verbalization of emotions in children and identification reliable person in the environment is well recognized, as well as the importance of extending follow-up for the most vulnerable children. Over the last twenty years, several studies have been dedicated to the evaluation of social interventions, as home or out-of-home care intervention. These studies highlight the reversibility of such disorders presented by children as well as positive effects on development and overall health in adulthood. In addition, research on risk factors for abuse have encouraged the development of targeted interventions with families with psychosocial risks to promote the quality of parent-child interaction and parenting skills. Such programs, for instance home-visiting program based on attachment theory in association with perinatal services, are currently under evaluation in France and showed encouraging results, although their direct effect on child abuse is not specifically assessed yet.

AB  - This study compared three groups, 2 treatment groups and a control group, to examine whether caregivers who adopted children with attachment challenges from the foster care system would report behavioral changes in their adopted children after participating in parenting programs and which program was more effective. Children with attachment trauma historically have been treated using behavioral modification, forced eye contact, and talk therapy. The problem with traditional treatment is that it does not educate the caregiver about the underlying issues or the neurobiology of attachment trauma, which can cause the child to react out of need for survival. Historical treatment has also focused on controlling the child's behavior rather than helping the caregiver create a relationship with the child. In this study, two well-known parenting programs were tested: The Benjamin Interactive Parenting Model (BIPM), a biopsychosocial based model, and the Love and Logic Parenting model (LLP), a behavioral based model. The BIPM is based on the stress model of parenting, which addresses the neurology of a child after experiencing attachment trauma and incorporates caregivers' psychological introspection of their own historical traumas that can interfere with the attachment process. The BIPM adds an interactive component using kinesthetic bilateral stimulation as a means to build relationship between parent and child, as well as to enhance areas of the brain that are depleted when a child experiences trauma due to neglect or abuse. The behavioral model LLP integrates love and kindness in parenting skills while creating discipline through naturalistic consequences. Outcomes were measured by the Child Behavior Checklist and the Revised Adult Attachment Scale. A multivariate analysis of covariance showed that there were no significant differences in the caregivers' reports of children's behavior or in levels of attachment among the three groups after controlling the pretest differences. One major limitation of the study was that not enough time was allowed for complete changes in behavior or attachment to take place. Caregivers who attended the parenting programs did report feeling more confident in their parenting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Families First Program provides families in crisis with a broad range of support services on an intensive, short-term basis. The program attempts to stabilize families by addressing underlying sources of stress that often lead to neglect and/or violence. Many program services are offered in the home, allowing caseworkers to strengthen, empower, and preserve families. Families who have children at imminent risk of removal from the home are referred to the program by MDSS staff. A caseworker contacts the family within an average of 28 hours. Over the next 4 to 6 weeks, the family receives intensive services in such areas as parenting, financial management, transportation, and job skills. Confidential surveys of referring workers, program staff, and participating families revealed a high level of satisfaction with the program. In particular, 82 percent of participating families reported improved communication and more appropriate discipline and care of children. When compared to a matched group of 225 children previously placed in foster care, 225 families in the Families First Program evidenced a consistently lower out-of- home placement rate 3 to 30 months following intervention. Recommendations to enhance the Families First Program are offered that focus on program integrity, outcome monitoring, service effectiveness, net widening, and followup using the MDSS management information system. 3 tables and 4 graphs

AB  - Children with histories of maltreatment and disruptions in care are at elevated risk for impairments in early language development, which contribute to difficulties in other developmental domains across childhood. Given research demonstrating associations between parent responsiveness and children's early language development, we examined whether a parenting intervention administered in infancy improved preschool receptive language skills in children involved with the child welfare system. Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) is a 10-session intervention that aims to enhance parent-child interactions. The follow-up results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that infants who received the ABC intervention (n = 24) scored significantly higher on a test of receptive vocabulary at age 36 months than infants who received a control intervention (n = 28). These results provide evidence of the critical role of parental responsiveness in supporting optimal language development among young children with histories of child welfare involvement.

AB  - It is hard to imagine child psychology without the work of John Bowlby: his insights into children's relational experience have left a major impact across the mental health professions. But of all these fields, clinical work with children—which deals so much with the consequences of faulty attachment—seems to have the most affinity with Bowlby's observations. Attachment-Based Clinical Work with Children and Adolescents assembles current theory and findings on attachment, applies them to clinical work with diverse youth populations, and offers valid ideas for building an attachment framework in practice. This volume covers the spectrum of attachment-oriented practice throughout the country with infants, toddlers, grade-schoolers, and teens in individual, family (including adoptive and foster families), and group settings. The novel interventions illustrated here, with their therapeutic and training implications, show attachment-oriented clinical work as evolving, relevant, open to multidisciplinary collaboration, and highly effective in repairing relationship damage in vulnerable youngsters. A sampling of the coverage; How mother-infant research informs attachment-based clinical practice, using modern attachment theory to guide clinical assessment of early attachment relationships, an attachment-based video intervention in a community mental health center, the essential role of the body in the parent-infant relationship, peer-play psychotherapy enhancing development among young children, and implementing attachment theory in the child welfare system.

AB  - The article discuses attachment, adversity, gene-environment interaction and implications for the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP). The BEIP is unique in its effort to determine whether a positive postinstitutional experience of high-quality foster care, experienced on a random basis by institutionalized children, prevents the anticipated adverse developmental consequences of growing up in an environment characterized by severe deprivation. The gene-X-environment (GXE) interaction evidence indicates that the disproportionate concern of psychiatric geneticists for the negative effects of adversity risks misrepresenting the nature of human development. It seems especially notable that it is found that the GXE involving attachment proved significant even with the GXE interaction involving the intervention taken into account with the reverse being true as well. every child deserves a decent quality of life. One should not lose sight of theory suggesting that plasticity itself can be induced by developmental experiences. To the extent that this proves to be the case, then it may be that even when genetic evidence suggests otherwise, those seemingly impervious to anticipated effects of developmental experiences and environmental exposures can have their development shaped by them.

AB  - The Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996) is a rich clinical and research instrument. In a matter of 60-90 minutes, it is possible with this instrument to uncover characteristic ways that the individual approaches attachment-relevant memories, thoughts, and feelings. The AAI reveals the individual's 'state of mind with regard to attachment' (Main, Goldwyn, & Hesse, 2003). In our work, we have developed an intervention program to help foster parents provide nurturing, sensitive care to their children. The task for parent trainers is very different depending on parents' state of mind. The AAI is integral to what we do in terms of tailoring a manualized treatment procedure, and in the predictions we make regarding treatment use and effectiveness. In this chapter, we describe the use of the AAI in this work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The current study examined predictors of treatment use among 56 foster mothers who participated in an attachment-based intervention program for foster infants. Foster mothers' levels of treatment use were coded at early, middle, and late phases of the intervention program. Foster mothers' states of mind with regard to attachment predicted their understanding of the intervention session concepts. Specifically, autonomous foster mothers showed higher levels of understanding at the start of the intervention program, when compared with non-autonomous foster mothers. State of mind with regard to attachment also predicted foster mothers' levels of reflective functioning during the intervention sessions. Autonomous foster mothers showed higher levels of reflective functioning at early, middle, and late stages of the intervention program, when compared with non-autonomous foster mothers. The relevance of these findings for both treatment effectiveness and treatment delivery is discussed.

AB  - Infants in foster care need sensitive, responsive caregivers to promote their healthy outcomes. The current study examined the effectiveness of the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up Intervention, a short-term, targeted, attachment-based intervention program designed to promote sensitive caregiving behavior among foster mothers. Ninety-six foster mother-infant dyads participated in this study; 44 dyads were assigned to the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up Intervention, and 52 dyads were assigned to a control intervention. Results of hierarchical linear modeling indicated that foster mothers who were assigned to the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up Intervention showed greater improvements in their sensitivity from pre- to postintervention assessment time points when compared with foster mothers who were assigned to the control intervention. We conclude that a short-term, targeted, attachment-based intervention is effective in changing foster mothers' responsiveness to their foster infants, which is critical for foster infants' healthy socioemotional adjustment.

AB  - Abstract: This paper presents the results of an independent evaluation of the Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) programme for young offenders in England, where it is known as Intensive Fostering (IF). Methods: A quasi-experimental, mixed methods study was carried out at the three pilot sites, with a total sample of 47 at follow up. Young people sentenced to IF were compared to a similar group, matched on the eligibility criteria for IF, the majority of whom were sentenced to custody. The groups were well-matched in terms of their characteristics and criminal histories. Official data on reconviction were collected at baseline and one year after entry to the IF placement or release from custody (Stage 1), and further data on programme completion and secondary outcomes were collected via interviews with young people and parents and questionnaires to professionals at baseline and follow up. Official data on reconviction were also collected one year after exit from the IF placements (Stage 2). Results: At Stage 1 the IF group were less likely to be reconvicted, had committed fewer and less serious recorded offences, on average, and took longer to commit their first recorded offence. At this point the IF group were more likely to be living with their families and less likely to be in custody than the comparison group. However by Stage 2 no significant differences in patterns of reconviction remained. Conclusions: IF successfully contained a high-risk group in the community, but the effects of the intervention washed out once they left their foster placements. Environmental effects on entry to and exit from the IF placements may help to explain the results at both stages.

AB  - This chapter discusses the importance of the development of positive caregiver-infant relationship in the fostering of attachment. Advances in the care of newborn infants, both healthy and sick, reflect a greater focus on family participation in infant care, an increased emphasis on infant mental health, and a broader systems approach to service delivery. The notion that developmental processes are impacted not only by individual characteristics of the child but by a 'transaction' between those characteristics and the environmental context is no longer new. However, translating that concept into a public policy that supports families' nurturing of child behavior and development has been over 30 years in the making. During that time, developmental programs and the provision of therapy services for infants and young children have been transformed. The prevailing direct service model, in which parents observed while individual therapies were administered, has been replaced by a relationship-based model that acknowledges the inherent complexity of developmental processes, and the primacy of the family in the infant's life. This evidence-based model demands that clinicians acquire a broader skill-set, shared across disciplines, including strategies for active engagement of the family and for supporting the family psychosocially.

AB  - Background: Children in foster care and their substitute caregivers (i.e., foster parents) lack access to evidence-based interventions designed to 1) mitigate the effects of maltreatment on child behavior and 2) strengthen parenting skills needed to effectively care for children with a history of maltreatment. Previous research has established that Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is an evidence-based intervention for children with a history of maltreatment. Yet, PCIT's broader impact on child welfare outcomes (i.e., placement and permanence) and the implications of adapting PCIT for foster families remains largely unknown. Furthermore, intervention effects on children's resilience remain largely unstudied, although interventions that facilitate child resilience may help to advance children's overall well-being. Methods: First, using foster parent reports from a randomized controlled trial of group PCIT and child welfare administrative data, logistic regression and survival analyses were employed to compare placement outcomes, permanency outcomes, and whether foster parents maintained their licenses between foster parent-child dyads who received group PCIT and foster parent-child dyads who received child welfare services-as-usual while accounting for child and parent-level covariates. Second, thematic analysis of focus group data explored PCIT practitioners' and foster parents' perceptions of PCIT within the context of child welfare. Third, a new measure of child resilience, the Early Childhood Measure of Resilience (ECMR), was developed and piloted with a sample of foster parent-child dyads to examine its psychometric properties using traditional and contemporary (i.e., Rasch modeling) analysis strategies. Results: Results from the first study indicated that children who received group PCIT were significantly more likely to have permanence within 12 months post-baseline compared to children who received services-as-usual. Furthermore, differences were observed across the groups on placement disruption, with children in the intervention condition having better placement stability, though analyses did not rise to the level of statistical significance. Foster parents' license status was comparable across the intervention and control groups. In the second study, analysis of PCIT practitioners' and foster parents' perceptions resulted in four exploratory themes related to the implementation of PCIT within child welfare: 1) Barriers to implementing PCIT in child welfare, 2) Factors that facilitate the implementation of PCIT in child welfare, 3) Developing a trauma-informed approach to PCIT, and 4) Strategies to facilitate the translation of PCIT into child welfare. Results from the third study revealed that the ECMR had acceptable internal consistency, concurrent validity, divergent validity, test re-test reliability, person reliability and item reliability. Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors underlying the ECMR. Rasch analyses provided insight into future instrument refinement. Implications: The current study findings contribute to the field's understanding of the effects of PCIT on placement and permanence, highlight the potential benefits of relying on multiple stakeholders' perspectives to help guide PCIT implementation within child welfare, and draw attention to assessing positive well-being (e.g., resilience across various domains of functioning). Collectively, study results help to support the translation of PCIT and the resilience framework into child welfare.

AB  - Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) has been shown to reduce challenging child behavior and improve parenting skills, yet treatment attrition, non-adherence and non-response remain matters of concern. This study analyzes rates and factors associated with attrition, non-adherence, and non-response using data from a randomized controlled trial of foster parent-child dyads who received brief, group-based PCIT. Multivariate logistic regressions demonstrated that, as compared to prior estimates of conventional outpatient PCIT, rates of treatment attrition, non-adherence and non-response from the group-based PCIT intervention were low. Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, rates of attrition were significantly higher among African American foster parents. No study variables were linked to treatment non-adherence. Foster parent ratings of child externalizing symptoms were positively associated with non-response. Implications for promoting retention and treatment effectiveness, successfully integrating PCIT into child welfare services and advancing future research are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: This study explored the experiences of youths in the Missouri foster care system who were receiving mental health services in order to identify characteristics that they valued in relationships with mental health professionals and in the services they received and to examine whether their attitudes toward services were associated with their experiences with services.Methods: As part of a larger study, 389 youths aged 17 years were asked open-ended questions about their experiences with mental health providers. The qualitative responses were classified through thematic analysis, and the frequencies of themes were assessed. Service use was measured, and the confidence subscale of the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help scale was used to measure attitudes.Results: Youths' comments generally centered on three aspects of their mental health care: their relationship with their mental health provider, the level of professionalism of their provider, and the effects of the treatment, including medication management. Youths who reported only negative experiences had less positive attitudes toward services than other youths, but they were not any more likely to have experienced changes in service use or medication six months later.Conclusions: Soliciting feedback from youths about mental health services is important to the provision of high-quality care. In addition to themes identified in similar studies, this study suggests that medication management plays an important role in the acceptability of the treatment that youths receive.

AB  - Background Persistent behavioural difficulties are common following paediatric acquired brain injury ( ABI). Parents and families also experience heightened stress, psychological symptoms and burden, and there is evidence of a reciprocal relationship between parent and child functioning, which may be mediated by the adoption of maladaptive parenting practices. Despite this, there is currently a paucity of research in family interventions in this population. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of Stepping Stones Triple P: Positive Parenting Program ( SSTP), with an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ( ACT) workshop, in improving child outcomes and parenting practices following paediatric ABI. Methods Fifty-nine parents of children (mean age 7 years, SD 3 years, 1 month; 35 males, 24 females) with ABI (Traumatic injuries 58%, Tumour 17%, Encephalitis or meningitis 15%, Cardiovascular accident 7%, Hypoxia 3%) who were evidencing at least mild behaviour problems were randomly assigned to treatment or care-as-usual conditions over 10 weeks. Mixed-model repeated-measures linear regression analyses were conducted to compare conditions from pre- to postintervention on child behavioural and emotional functioning (Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) and dysfunctional parenting style (Parenting Scale). Assessment of maintenance of change was conducted at a 6-month follow-up. The trial was registered on Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ID: ACTRN12610001051033, ). Results Significant time-by-condition interactions were identified on number and intensity of child behaviour problems, child emotional symptoms and parenting laxness and overreactivity, indicating significant improvements in the treatment condition, with medium-to-large effect sizes. Most improvements were maintained at 6 months. Conclusions Group parenting interventions incorporating Triple P and ACT may be efficacious in improving child and parenting outcomes following paediatric ABI. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The current study was designed to explore the use of behavioral (i.e., accuracy and reaction times) and electrophysiological measures (i.e., event-related potentials) to assess the impact of a family-based preventive intervention for preschool-aged, maltreated children in foster care. These measures were recorded during a computerized flanker task designed to assess cognitive control and response monitoring. The sample was recruited from a larger randomized efficacy trial of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC-P) and included foster children assigned to the intervention condition (n = 10), foster children assigned to a services-as-usual comparison condition (n = 13), and low-income, non maltreated community children (n = 11). The children’s behavioral and electrophysiological performance on the task was generally consistent with previous research with adults and older children. There were no group differences on the behavioral measures of cognitive control or response monitoring. Notably, however, group differences were observed on the electrophysiological measures of response monitoring. Specifically, the foster children who received services as usual were significantly less responsive to performance feedback about errors than the foster children who received the intervention and the non maltreated children. Applications of this methodology and implications of the results for future prevention research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Every day, the United States child welfare system is entrusted with the care of over 400,000 children through foster care. The majority of children entering this social setting are infants, the most developmentally vulnerable. METHODS: human health ecology model and attachment theory are used to delineate the social setting of foster care and its impact on developmental health, and elucidates the relationship between childhood experiences and the overall continuum of health. Additionally, the notion of inherited genes and environmental influences or epigenetics toward gene expression will be explored. RESULTS: Research points out that what happens in childhood matters; the consequences of not addressing childhood adversity and the associated risk factors of foster care increase a child's risk for poor developmental health and other major illnesses noted later in life such as cardiac disease, depression, and even premature death. Healthcare providers and others charged with caring for this vulnerable population who understand the social setting of foster care and its impact on developmental health may help identify and treat developmental problems earlier, thus potentially reducing long-term effects of abuse and neglect. CONCLUSION: Improvement plans that promote best practice for child welfare must include those that directly address the unique developmental needs of all infants and children in foster care itself. Such plans will ensure that foster care as an intervention to protect vulnerable children at risk does not create more harm by reducing the associated risks and maximizing benefits while in foster care, and ensures that those born genetically vulnerable and disproportionately susceptible to poor outcomes in adversity are also protected and provided opportunities that promote optimal developmental health.

AB  - Abstract: Objectives: To assess the long-term impacts of Sweden's Contact Family Program (CFP) for children on participants’ future outcome profiles, here conceptualized as combinations of outcomes related to mental health problems, public welfare receipt, illicit drug use, placement in out-of-home care, educational achievement, and offending. Methods: We analyzed longitudinal register data on more than 950,000 children born 1980–90, including 6693 children who entered CFP at 2–5 years of age, with a follow-up until 2008. Children's outcome profiles were identified by latent class analysis. The average program impact was estimated by means of propensity score matching. Results: Long-term outcomes for those who had received the intervention were not better than for matched peers who did not receive the intervention. Simulation-based sensitivity analyses indicate that some of our estimated negative treatment effects may be affected by unobserved factors related to program participation and outcomes. However, both selection and outcome effects must be extremely strong in order to generate notable positive effects of CFP participation. Conclusions: The results did not find support for CFP effectiveness in reducing risks of compromised long-term development in children. Since the intervention reaches a high-risk group of children and is popular among users, volunteer families and professionals, the program should be reinforced with knowledge-based components that target known risk factors for child welfare recipients.

AB  - This study explores reflective functioning (RF) in foster carers using the Parent Development Interview. A mixed-methods design was employed in eliciting personal accounts of fostering by carers alongside an assessment of their RF. Results suggest that the carers displayed varying levels of RF and specifically that the elements of reflection that may be most salient for effective fostering - developmental, systemic and attachment-based thinking - were uncommon among the sample. Given the importance of foster carers' potential to redirect the lives of children and enhance healthy attachment strategies, therapeutic and training packages that might increase RF are considered.

AB  - This dissertation explored foster mothers' experiences of parenting a foster child who displayed problematic attachment. This topic is important because research suggests foster children presenting with attachment problems often experience disrupted foster placements, which are known to be detrimental to their continued development. An introductory letter seeking foster mothers with difficult to care for foster children between the ages of 2 and younger than 6 years was sent by seven foster care agencies in Allegheny County to all of those agencies' foster mothers. Foster mothers were not told in advance that the study involved attachment-disordered foster children. Six foster mothers volunteered. The Kinship Center Attachment Questionnaire (KCAQ), Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist 1½-5, and a Demographic Questionnaire were completed by each foster mother before a semi-structured, qualitative research interview was conducted. Following each interview, the KCAQ was used to determine if a foster child displayed problematic attachment. One participant was disqualified as a result. A natural division emerged among the five remaining foster mothers: four requested their foster child's removal and one foster mother who was adopting. The data were analyzed using an adaptation of the empirical phenomenological method advanced by Giorgi. Results included a General Holistic Summary that offered a powerful life-world description of the foster mother's experience, as well as a detailed account of losing a foster child due to the foster mother's request for that child's removal. Additionally, attributes essential to the successful foster parenting of an attachment-disordered foster child were identified. Several ways in which the Child Protective System and mental health professionals may hinder a foster child making a successful adjustment to foster placement were described. Specifically, a foster child's traumatic removal from care was illustrated and concerns regarding the damaged caused by this type of agency intervention were articulated. Problems associated with being assigned an attachment-relevant diagnosis were noted (e.g., limitations of the DSM-IV-TR, difficulties making a differential diagnoses) and the adverse effects of being inappropriately diagnosed discussed. Foster mothers' general complaints regarding the Child Protective System (e.g., lack of information, lack of support) were delineated and recommendations for training professionals and foster mothers presented.

AB  - Parenting programmes are effective interventions for preventing and treating conduct problems in young children. Up to 20% of children in disadvantaged areas have conduct disorder. Recent government initiatives such as targeting early years services to designated disadvantaged Flying Start areas in Wales have resulted in increased nursery-care provision for pre-schoolers, yet little has been done to equip nursery staff with effective child behaviour management strategies. The purpose of this non-randomised trial platform study was to establish the feasibility of delivery and the effectiveness of the new Incredible Years Toddler Parent Programme in supporting nursery staff in managing difficult behaviour in the nursery. The Parent Programme is a 12-session (a two-hour session/week) course for carers/parents of children aged one to three years old, which encourages carers to: establish positive relationships with children through play and child-centred activities; use praise, rewards and incentives to encourage appropriate behaviours; and use effective limit setting and clear instructions. Thirteen nursery workers were recruited from two Flying Start nurseries in Wales. Measures were completed on 28 nursery children by their parents and nursery workers, baseline and four months post-baseline, with the intervention delivered in the interim. Paired t-test analyses demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) for child behaviour in the nursery and nursery staff's self-reported stress and sense of competence. No improvement in child behaviour was reported in the home. In conclusion, nursery worker training could incorporate the Incredible Years parent programme to support the staff in managing child behaviour in the nursery. The intervention should be delivered to both home and out-of-home carers to encourage consistency in child management strategies.

AB  - the incidence of conduct disorder in young children is 10% in the general population and 37% among fostered children. Up to 40% of untreated children diagnosed with conduct disorder develop problems later in life including drug misuse, criminal and violent behaviour. There are more than 80 000 looked after children in the UK, with 5000 in Wales. Challenging child behaviour is the main reason for placement breakdown and has huge cost implications as challenging children cost up to 10 times more in service use than children without conduct disorder. The Incredible Years (IY) evidence-based parenting programme is an effective, low cost solution in improving child behaviour and social competence in 'conventional' families and thus has the potential to support foster carers in managing difficult behaviours. Our main aims were to establish: This was a 12-month trial platform study with 46 foster carers in three authorities in Wales. Carers were allocated 2:1 intervention to waiting-list control. Validated measures were used to assess 'parenting' competency, carers' depression levels, child behaviour and service use. Measures were administered at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Intervention carers received the programme between baseline and follow-up. Analyses showed a significant reduction in child problem behaviour and improvement in carers' depression levels for intervention families at follow-up, compared with control. Unexpectedly, there was a significant improvement in control carers' self-reported 'parenting' strategies. Special education was the greatest service cost for looked after children. Initial foster carer training could incorporate the IY programme to support carers in establishing positive relationships and managing difficult child behaviour. Programme participation may lead to reduced service use and improved placement stability.

AB  - Difficult social conditions, including family violence, poverty, and substance abuse/dependence, contribute to increasing numbers of children who are not newborns and who need a permanent home. Parents who accept children with disrupted attachment into their families need to know about evidence-based ways that they can learn to help those children feel part of their new family and to develop lasting bonds of attachment to one another. Parent psychoeducation and its accompanying filial therapy skills for use by adoptive families were the focus of this qualitative study, which sought to understand the lived experiences of parents of adopted children who have turned to this method to help their child. The study looked at how the parents came to their decision to adopt, how they realized that they needed help with their child, their experiences learning how to do special play time with their child, the meaning they attributed to being their child's therapist, and what types of learning they experienced. The five families who participated in the study were varied in terms of family composition, adoption circumstances of the child, and racial/ethnic diversity. Two of the families were married couples, one was a same sex couple, one a single parent, and one a grandmother. Two of the children were adopted as infants from Guatemala, two of the children came from the United States foster care system, and the final child was at risk for going into the system were it not for her grandmother's willingness to provide kinship care. All of the children had experienced disruption from a primary attachment relationship prior to being adopted. Five major themes in the findings were identified in the responses from the eight adults: 1) the desire to be a parent but not necessarily through childbirth; 2) the decision to seek help through learning new skills in parenting due to escalating concern they did not have the skills to help the child; 3) the ease in learning filial skills with the help of the skilled parent psychoeducation process; 4) a systematic positive change in behaviors and emotions of all members of the parent-child dyad or triad; and 5) the citing of different forms of learning throughout the process. Implications for future research include seeking a broader range of family demographics of adoptive parents who practice parent psychoeducation with their adopted children, focusing on long term adjustment of families, and comparing parent psychoeducation/filial therapy with other therapeutic models used with adoptive families. Suggestions for practice include increasing the numbers of therapists trained in parent psychoeducation, attachment, and trauma; and expanding the parent psychoeducation process to include detailed information about the meaning of child responses in therapy, changes in child behavior due to increased feelings of safety and security, and the applicability of the filial skills outside of the special play time.

AB  - Aim: In this article, an applied psychology approach designed to support carers of looked-after children is described and its impact on these young people is evaluated. Rationale: Children and young people in public care are arguably the most vulnerable group in our society and despite considerable support and financial expenditure, their personal, social and wellbeing outcomes have remained stubbornly poor. In particular, school-based interventions have led to only slight improvements in attainment levels and these children still lag far behind their peers. The ‘Emotional Warmth’ model of professional child care was developed to empower residential carers and foster/adoptive parents to understand and meet the often-complex needs of these children. In this article, the main components of the ‘Emotional Warmth’ model are described, the key role of the psychologist consultant is outlined and some input outcomes are considered. Findings: The results of a ten-month ‘Emotional Warmth’ project involving the foster and adoptive parents of fourteen children are presented. The analysis shows that significant positive change occurred in both the behavioural and affective measures (p less than 0.05). These results are discussed, as are the serendipitous benefits for both the educational psychologist consultants and their local authority service manager. Limitations: Some methodological constraints are considered. Conclusions: It is argued that this model of professional child care can enable foster and adoptive parents to achieve positive outcomes for the young people in their care.

AB  - This randomized controlled study is a preliminary investigation on the effects of Child-Parent Relationship Therapy (CPRT) with 61 adoptive parents. The participants in this study identified themselves as the following: 54 European American, 3 Black American, 3 Hispanic/Latino, and 1 individual who chose not to indicate ethnicity. The study included 23 couples and 15 individual mothers. The CPRT is a structured, time limited approach that trains caregivers to be an active participant as a therapeutic change agent in their child’s life. Results from a two (group) by two (measures) split plot ANOVA indicated that adoptive parents who participated in 10 weeks of CPRT reported statistically significant decreases in child behavior problems and parent child-relationship stress. Statistically significant increases in parent empathy were also reported by raters blinded to the study. CPRT demonstrated a medium to large treatment effect on reducing children’s behavior problems and parent-child relationship stress. In addition, CPRT demonstrated a large treatment effect on increasing parental empathy. The results of the study provide preliminary support for CPRT as a responsive intervention for adoptive parents and their children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Compassion-focused therapy (CFT) is embedded in an evolutionary, functional analysis of psychopathology, with a focus on affiliative, caring and compassion processes. CFT has been applied in a number of adult settings, but its clinical applications in child and adolescent psychopathology and psychotherapy have not been systematically explored. This article describes the applications of CFT in paediatric populations. Specifically, the following developmental considerations are discussed: the unique importance of parent–child and attachment relationships for the development of self-compassion, being open to compassion from others and being compassionate to others; the potential effect of compassion training on the maturing brain (affective regulation systems); and the therapeutic targeting of shame and self-criticism to alleviate psychological distress and enhance the effectiveness of cognitive–behavioural interventions. LEARNING OBJECTIVES • Understand and differentiate the three affect regulation systems and their links to different forms of child and adolescent psychopathology • Recognise the main components of compassionate mind training with children and adolescents, and related specific therapeutic strategies and exercises • Acknowledge the importance of adopting a parent–child approach in CFT DECLARATION OF INTEREST None [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of BJPsych Advances is the property of Cambridge University Press and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - The ever-growing number of out-of-home children in Italy over the last decade has urged an assessment of the available care services. Although foster care is spreading rapidly, many young people are still housed in residential facilities. Reflection on residential care quality has intensified at both a national and an international level. This paper presents the results of a study on residential care facilities for children and young people in the region of Northern Italy (Lombardy). Four dimensions of `quality' are considered: efficiency, effectiveness, participation in planning and intervention, and empowerment of children and their family relationships. The combined effects of these dimensions are defined as `relational quality'. The results show that residential care facilities are generally good, while Social Services resources often appear inadequate for interventions aimed at birth families (efficiency). The well-being of children in residential care facilities is high, even if they tend to move from one facility to another, rarely returning to their birth family (effectiveness). The involvement of children and their families at different stages of the care path is limited (participative approach). Finally, the most critical element is the failure to properly involve birth families (empowerment).

AB  - This comprehensive work is more than just the standard reference on attachment theory and research—it has helped to define and shape this rapidly growing field. The substantially revised and expanded second edition incorporates a decade's worth of major advances in theory, research, and clinical applications. Chapters from the first edition have been thoroughly updated, and compelling new chapters have been added on neuroscience of attachment, foster care and adoption, attachment in middle childhood, affect regulation, divorce, and attachment issues in later life. Part I reviews theoretical foundations, from the pioneering work of John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth to contemporary elaborations and refinements. Part II presents biological and evolutionary perspectives. Authors describe what has been learned about attachment by using psychophysiological measures, brain imaging techniques, and studies of primates and other animals. Parts III and IV probe the impact of attachment processes on development and close relationships across the lifespan, showcasing innovative measures for infants, children, adolescents, and adults. In Part V, connections among attachment processes, psychological adaptation, and psychopathology are examined. This section features important new findings on the origins and outcomes of attachment disorganization. The contributions of attachment theory and research to diverse psychotherapeutic approaches and intervention programs are also discussed. Rounding out the volume. Part VI explores cross-cultural issues and special topics, including the distinct properties of fathers as attachment figures, attachment and religious behavior, and implications for child and family policy. Unique in the breadth and depth of its coverage, this state-of-the-science handbook will prove indispensable to anyone who studies attachment processes or draws on this vital body of knowledge in mental health practice. Graduate students in developmental, social, and clinical psychology will find it an invaluable text. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Play therapy is a way of helping troubled children cope with their distress, using play as the medium of communication between child and therapist. The method is based on the central assumption that play is the place where children first recognise the separateness of what is 'me' and 'not me' and begin to develop a relationship with the world beyond the self. It is the child's way of making contact with their environment. Definitions of play therapy will be determined by the perspectives of the person describing the process. This discourse is from the perspective of a play therapist with an interest in the imaginative play of children and adults. The author's definitions have a specific quality related to her professional experience but much of her understanding of children and her profession is derived from the dominant cultural image of the 'normal' child. The author stresses that it is important to recognise that there is no one 'truth' about play therapy, but, there are general principles that apply to all play therapy interventions and do not depend on a particular mode of working. The key process is the use of mostly imaginative play that takes place within a relationship between the child and therapist. What Winnicott called 'playing in the presence of someone'. The child who comes for play therapy will be actively playing and replaying complex environmental issues and trying to cast them into manageable forms. When the play is shared with the therapist who is non-judgemental, then the negative effects of anger, distress, sadness, or shame-humiliation can be relieved through the play within the relationship. Introduction to Play Therapy contains the following chapters: 'The meaning of childhood,' where the author reflects on the thoughts, ideas and feelings about the child and childhood which permeate our society; 'Definitions of play therapy,' in which the author reiterates that theory and perspective about play therapy emerge from individual practice; 'Models of play therapy', in which three modes of working are explored: nondirective play therapy, focused play therapy and the author's own approach, which is collaborative play therapy; 'Training and professional issues for play therapists', in which the primary aims and standards of practice of the The British Association of Play Therapists (BAPT) are described; 'Settings for play therapy', in which different settings and reasons for play therapy in those setting are offered; 'Helping children through difficult life events and with chronic conditions', describes two play therapy interventions, one individual intervention with a girl waiting for an adoptive placement and a group intervention with children diagnosed with ADHD and/or depression; 'Play therapy and therapeutic play', in which the author offers some views about the importance of imaginative play for children and some suggestions of games and stories to stimulate play as a way for adults to start to make connections with children as well as describing a way of playing for refugee children which was written as part of an information pack; and finally 'Research in play therapy', where the author recounts play therapists describing aspects of their research projects using case studies and hermeneutic research as their methods.

AB  - Increases in delinquency and violence among adolescents in the last decade are rooted in a number of interrelated social problems that may originate within the family structure. This publication is one of several in the "Family Strengthening Series" that describes the effectiveness of family intervention programs and provides resources to families and communities. Research has shown that association with delinquent peers is a strong predictor of future involvement in delinquent and violent behavior. The Treatment Foster Care (TFC) Program was developed as an alternative to residential and group care placement for serious and chronic juvenile offenders. The program is designed to reduce an adolescent's exposure to other delinquent youth. The program places juvenile offenders who require residential treatment with foster families who are trained to provide close supervision, fair limits, consistent consequences, and a supportive relationship. TFC parents are part of the treatment team along with program staff. TFC parents implement a structured, individualized program designed to build on the adolescent's strengths and to establish clear rules, expectations, and limits. An overview of the TFC model is presented, which describes the planning and implementation; funding; staffing and training; selection of program participants; and program evaluation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This article describes the results of a pilot study that evaluated the effectiveness of the Early Intervention Foster Care (EIFC) program in the period immediately following a child's placement in a new foster home. METHOD: Data were collected from an EIFC group, a regular foster care group, and a community comparison group-each with 10 participants-via questionnaires for children and their caretakers and salivary cortisol sampling. RESULTS: EIFC foster parents adopted and maintained positive parenting strategies, EIFC children's behavioral adjustment improved, and changes occurred in several salivary cortisol measures. Moreover, regular foster care children exhibited decrements in functioning in several areas over the same time period. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed with regard to how such research fits into a larger program of prevention research for high-risk preschool children.

Research evidence is presented on TFC and in support of other treatment strategies. The cost-effectiveness of TFC is also examined. Research indicates that despite wide variance in program models in terms of population served and components included, the TFC use of professionally trained and supported community families has been a consistently effective approach.

AB  - Parent training for foster parents is mandated by federal law and supported by state statues in nearly all states; however, little is known about the efficacy of that training, and recent reviews underscore that the most widely used curricula in the child welfare system (CWS) have virtually no empirical support (Grimm, Youth Law News, April-June:3-29, 2003). On the other hand, numerous theoretically based, developmentally sensitive parent training interventions have been found to be effective in experimental clinical and prevention intervention trials (e.g., Kazdin and Wassell, Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 39:414-420, 2000; McMahon and Forehand, Helping the noncompliant child, Guilford Press, New York, USA, 2003; Patterson and Forgatch, Parents and adolescents: I. Living together, Castalia Publishing, Eugene, OR, USA, 1987; Webster-Stratton et al., Journal of Clinical Child Pyschology Psychiatry, 42:943-952, 2001). One of these, Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC; Chamberlain, Treating chronic juvenile offenders: Advances made through the Oregon Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care model, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, USA, 2003), has been used with foster parents of youth referred from juvenile justice. The effectiveness of a universal intervention, KEEP (Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported) based on MTFC (but less intensive) was tested in a universal randomized trial with 700 foster and kinship parents in the San Diego County CWS. The goal of the intervention was to reduce child problem behaviors through strengthening foster parents' skills. The trial was designed to examine effects on both child behavior and parenting practices, allowing for specific assessment of the extent to which improvements in child behavior were mediated by the parenting practices targeted in the intervention. Child behavior problems were reduced significantly more in the intervention condition than in the control condition, and specific parenting practices were found to mediate these reductions, especially for high-risk children in foster families reporting more than six behavior problems per day at baseline.

AB  - Most foster parents in the United States are required to participate in training, yet no empirical support exists for the training's effectiveness. During the past two decades, high-quality clinical trials have documented that parent management training (PMT) programs produce positive outcomes for children and families in clinical and school settings; yet, these advances have not transferred to foster/kinship parents. Here, we describe a randomized control trial testing the effectiveness of a PMT-based treatment with 700 foster/kinship parents in San Diego County. The collaborative processes to engage stakeholders, the strategies for involving parents, and the results of two levels of developer involvement in training and supervision on child behavioral outcomes are also described.

AB  - There is much to be learned about 'what it takes' to scale-up evidence-based practices in real-world community settings. Although increasing attention has focused on factors that influence the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in child and family service sectors, controlled studies that directly examine these factors empirically in real-world settings are limited. This chapter describes the need for scale-up of EBPs and provides a description of a large-scale randomized implementation trial of an evidence based mental health intervention delivered through county social service systems. In this trial, 51 counties in California and Ohio were randomly assigned to one of two implementation conditions for one of the few evidence-based training programs for foster parents, called Treatment Foster Care Oregon (TFCO; formerly Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care; MTFC). TFCO is a community-based alternative to placement in residential or group care settings for children and adolescents with severe behavioral and/or emotional problems.

AB  - This project summarizes, using a treatment protocol review technique, characteristics of effective interventions from nine studies of child maltreatment that examined recovery from abuse or the effects of maltreatment on child and parent outcomes. Results suggest that stronger effects are yielded by targeting parents and the parent-child interaction context in home-based settings during early childhood, designing multicomponent interventions delivered by professionals for teaching parenting competency skills, and targeting families of higher risk children.

AB  - Coping strategies are believed to protect against the harmful effects of maltreatment on children's psychosocial outcomes. Caregivers are thought to be critical in helping children develop adaptive coping strategies, yet many maltreated children have poor and/or insecure relationships with their parents. A quality relationship with a caring, non-parental adult (e.g., a mentor), however, may be one strategy to promote healthy coping among maltreated children. Children ( N = 154) in this study participated in a mentoring and skill-based program for maltreated preadolescents placed in foster care. Hierarchical regression was used to assess the association between children's reports of their relationship with their mentor at the end of the intervention and four coping strategies (i.e., Active, Support-seeking, Avoidance, and Distraction) 6 months following the intervention, while accounting for baseline coping strategies and other demographic factors. Above and beyond the covariates, better mentoring relationship quality was associated with children's greater use of Active and Distraction coping 6-month post-intervention. Mentoring relationship quality was not significantly associated with children's Avoidance or Support-seeking coping. The findings suggest that mentoring programs may be a fruitful approach to improving vulnerable children's coping skills. Healthy coping is hypothesized to protect against the harmful effects of maltreatment and to promote resilience in the face of multiple stressors (Banyard & Williams, ; Boxer & Sloan-Power, 2013; Cicchetti & Rogosch, 2009). It remains unclear, however, how best to promote positive coping among maltreated children, who are disproportionately exposed to numerous adverse childhood experiences (Raviv, Taussig, Culhane & Garrido, 2010). Theories of coping emphasize the importance of coping socialization through quality parent-child relationships (Kliewer et al., 2006; Skinner & Wellborn, ). Unfortunately, many maltreated children are exposed to poor quality and/or inadequate caregiving (Baer & Martinez, 2006), which may place them at risk for engaging in unhealthy or inappropriate forms of coping. It is reasonable to expect that positive relationships with other non-parental adults (e.g., mentors) would affect coping behaviors given the positive impact that quality relationships have on a myriad of emotional and behavioral child outcomes (DuBois, Portillo, Rhodes, Silverthorn & Valentine, 2011; Keller & Pryce, 2012; Thomson & Zand, ). Because children in foster care often transition in and out of schools and home environments, a quality relationship with a mentor (a consistent presence in the child's life) may be well suited to promote healthy coping strategies.

AB  - Foster youth experience adversity before, during, and after their time in care, and the long-term outcomes for many suggest lasting difficulties in professional, education, and social-emotional domains. Despite the challenges faced, some former foster youth achieve success across these domains of functioning. The literature on resilience and thriving suggests that protective factors and experiences of mastery may play a part in helping at-risk youth overcome the risks inherent in U.S. foster care experiences. The goal of this study is to better understand the experiences that contribute to a thriving response through in-depth interviews with high functioning former foster youth, and in doing so contribute to informing policy and intervention to better prepare current and future foster youth for success following foster care. A qualitative approach was used to elicit patterns of experience from participants, which were then coded and developed into a theoretical narrative. Notable themes involved both individual protective factors (personal traits such as self-confidence, self-reliance, positive orientation, and future orientation) and environmental protective factors (important relationships with foster parents, biological family members, teachers, and partners). Participants also reported experiences of mastery in the domains of school, work, and activities of daily living that may have contributed to their thriving response. Findings support and expand upon existing literature, shedding new light on the impact of positive expectations,structured environments, and the role of corrective emotional experience in mitigating the effects of past trauma. Implications of these findings and avenues for further research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Due to recent advances in medical technology, children who were once relegated to a life of institutionalization can now be cared for in the home. Children with medical needs are overrepresented in the general foster care population; however, many children with chronic physical conditions require a specialized home environment that is equipped to manage their complex needs. While most outcome evaluations of treatment foster care programs have focused on placement permanency, safety, or psychological adjustment as primary outcome measures, other important variables, such as developmental functioning, have gone largely neglected. Given that children with complex medical conditions are at risk for compromised developmental adjustment, it is important to understand child, parent, and family factors that facilitate more positive adjustment. The present study used data that were collected from children and foster parents who were enrolled in a treatment foster care program in a large Midwestern metropolitan area, Measures used in this study included the Denver Developmental Screening Test - II, the Questionnaire on Resources and Stress - Friedrich Edition, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Mentor Interview, developed for this research, As a group, the children showed improved developmental functioning over the six-month period. The children who were functioning closer to their age at initial placement exhibited greater developmental progress than the other children in the sample. Similarly, children with less severe medical conditions showed more developmental progress over the study period when compared to children with more severe medical conditions. Foster parents' social support was not found to predict developmental gain, nor was it found to moderate the relationship between stress and developmental gain. Post-hoc analysis revealed that foster parents' stress did significantly predict child developmental gain, with lower stress scores being associated with greater developmental gain. These findings are inconclusive, given the dearth of research in this area, along with several methodological limitations. Nevertheless, they provide an encouraging indication that treatment foster care is a viable intervention model that can be enhanced by attention to various child and parent factors.

AB  - The efficacy of toddler-parent psychotherapy (TPP) as a preventive intervention for promoting secure attachment in the offspring of depressed mothers was evaluated, 63 mothers with major depressive disorder being randomly assigned to TPP (n = 27) or to a no treatment group (n = 36) and compared with a control group (n = 45) of women with no current or past mental disorder. At baseline, comparable and higher rates of attachment insecurity were found in the two depressed offspring groups as compared with the non-depressed control group. At the post-treatment follow-up, offspring in the intervention group attained rates of secure attachment that were comparable with those of youngsters in the non-depressed control group. In contrast, the children in the depressed control group continued to demonstrate a greater rate of attachment insecurity than children in the non-depressed control group. The findings support the efficacy of an attachment-theory based model of intervention for fostering developmental competence in the offspring of depressed mothers.

AB  - One of the more basic ways to improve a bond between two individuals who wish to enhance their relationship is to increase physical connections, or closeness. Linked-In activities allow clients (typically parents and children) to be closer to one another without that appearing to be the main focus of therapy. Initially, the first time this activity is attempted, there may not seem to be much of an effect in increasing proximity, but over time, repeated use of this activity can foster attachment and a closer, more trusting relationship. The focus of this activity is for each client (parent or child) to use only one hand to work together to accomplish a task, which is selected either by the therapist or by the clients. Focusing on the task diverts attention from the physical proximity, lessens resistance, and demonstrates to clients that they can rely on one another and enjoy themselves as they accomplish a task. Initial success can be built upon by increasingly difficult Linked-In activities as therapy progresses. Linked-In is especially useful for clients who would like to strengthen their relationship and increase physical proximity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The primary aim of this study was to explore the effects of Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) intervention on Romanian foster parents' psychological functioning (emotional distress) and how this intervention affects their perceived parenting behavior within their family. The participants included 80 Romanian foster parents (78 female and 2 male) ranging in age from 28 to 59 years (M = 45.73 years, SD = 6.38) in one county. Participants in the present study were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: REBT group (or the experimental group) and Control group. REBT group received Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) and the Control group was given the standard training program on abuse and neglect that was taught within the Romanian child protection system. A pre-post design was used that included the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ) as outcome measures. The results of the present study supported our hypothesis that professional foster parents receiving REBT would show lower levels of emotional distress (anxiety, depression, and anger) and an increased use of improved parenting behaviors (involvement, positive parenting, poor monitoring/supervision, inconsistent discipline, corporal punishments, and other behaviors) compared with foster parents who received the standard training program, as showed by parents self-reported change scores. The results of the present study highlight the usefulness of understanding the importance of professional foster parents receiving REBT. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Data from the Child Behavior Checklist, interviews with caregivers, and foster care and school records indicated that children in FIAP placement had moderately better outcomes in terms of psychological functioning, running away, severe delinquency, incarceration, and adjustment in stable home placements. Results of most tests of psychological functioning and the number of placement changes were insignificant between groups. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper presents results of an evaluation study of the Fostering Individualized Assistance Program (FIAP), an effort to provide individualized wraparound supports and services to foster children with emotional/behavioral disturbances and their families (foster, biological, and/or adoptive). The program aims to stabilize child placement and improve child emotional and behavioral adjustment through means such as: (1) child and family assessment; (2) life-domain service planning; (3) clinical case management of individualized, wraparound supports and services; and (4) follow-along supports to maintain permanency. The study compared a sample (n=54) of children who received this individualized, wraparound process with a comparable sample of children who received standard services through the Florida foster care system. Findings indicated that: FIAP children were significantly less likely to change placements than comparison children; both groups showed significant improvement in emotional/behavioral adjustment over time; FIAP boys were more likely to show signs of delinquency than comparison boys; older FIAP youth were more likely than comparison youth to be in permanency settings; and school absences and suspensions were lower for FIAP youth. Recommendations for developing and implementing an individualized wraparound system of care are offered. (Contains 11 references.) (DB)

This chapter provides (a) a description of the recommended practices of this intervention, (b) outcome data from a randomly selected group of children in foster care who received the intervention and a comparable group of children who received practices standard to the foster care system, (c) follow-up data on permanency status at 6–12 mo following any contact with the family specialists of the wraparound intervention, and (d) implications of these findings for wraparound interventions for children with emotional or behavior disturbances in the dependency system. A total of 131 children (aged 7–15 yrs) participated in the study. Results show that the FIAP wraparound process assisted in improving the externalizing and delinquency behaviors for males, and increased the likelihood of permanent placement for older youths.

AB  - The trauma of child abuse is magnified for children placed in foster care. The disruption, disorganization, and discontinuity experienced in foster care further extend the trauma of abuse. Effective treatment of foster youth must prioritize the basic need for children to experience continuity, stability, and permanency in attachment to a healthy adult(s). Short-term, symptom-focused interventions are inappropriate for this population of ethnically diverse, socioeconomically disadvantaged, underserved, multiply traumatized youths with complex psychiatric comorbidity. We describe a long-term, psychoanalytically oriented, relational play therapy intervention for foster youth and present initial empirical results describing the impact of this approach.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine a model of foster parent training in which specific therapeutic parenting skills (communication and conflict resolution) were taught to foster parents by other previously trained foster parents, A comparison was made of how well these skills were learned under this condition as compared to when instructors were mental health professionals, Pre- to posttest measures revealed that foster parents who received training from either the professional or nonprofessional staff showed greater acquisition of these skills than did a comparison group of untrained foster parents, and that trained foster parents and professional staff did not differ substantially in their ability to transmit these skills.

AB  - Limited success in describing and measuring potential powerful variables related to child, family, and service variables that affect outcome in therapeutic foster care has restricted the ability to develop an effective system of care for children. This study tested and used newly developed/modified scales and questionnaires measuring the impact of foster family suitability for fostering, quality of the milieu in the foster home, and program supports on change in the child's functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale admission scores minus post-placement scores). Fifty-five foster parents parenting seventy-seven foster children and twelve social workers participated. Subjects were drawn from therapeutic foster care programs within two local non-profit agencies. Case records provided children's admission age, gender, previous placements, and admission functioning. A multivariate correlational design was used. Findings indicate social workers' assessment of quality conditions in foster homes predict change in child functioning in terms of attachment and caretaking, affection and acceptance. Child characteristics had no significant relationship with change in child functioning. Foster parents' suitability for fostering was not correlated with change in child functioning post-placement, but the regression analyses of the social workers' assessment of quality conditions in a foster home and the Foster Parent Assessment Scale relating to health, interpersonal relationships, adaptability, and team member accounted for the largest variance in the dependent variable. Foster fathers' overall satisfaction with program support was tested to be a critical factor related to change in child functioning. Although findings are targeted to therapeutic foster homes served by two agencies, all scales demonstrated appropriate levels of reliability and discriminate ability with this population. These scales are recommended to select foster parents and measure ability to create an effective treatment milieu. Use of the GAF to determine changes in child functioning is a reliable outcome strategy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study explores the attachment experience of foster parents. The researcher used a qualitative research framework to explore what 10 foster parents experienced in regards to attachment with their foster children. Based on the data and content analysis, a foster parent ecology emerged showing that the foster parent/child attachment relationship is affected by doctors, therapists, social workers, case workers, other foster parents, and the biological parents. The temporary nature of foster care and the goal of reunification of child to biological parent also affected the attachment relationship between foster parent and foster child.

AB  - Many foster parents are challenged by the social-emotional consequences of children in foster care who have experienced childhood trauma. In this project, we provided foster parents with a trauma-informed, evidence-based parenting program (Incredible Years; IY) and assessed its impact on child behavior, foster parent stress and attitudes, and perceived effect on parenting. Foster parents of children aged 2–7 yrs. were randomly assigned to IY intervention or control groups. We assessed pre-post child behavior, parenting stress, and parental attitudes. A subset of intervention foster parents completed post-intervention focus groups and in-depth interviews. Main themes from qualitative data (3 focus groups; 5 interviews; total n = 12) revealed that IY foster parents perceived changes in their parenting that they attributed to the peer support, new perspectives on the value of play, and specific tools that enhanced parenting skills. These parenting skills improved family relations and were sustained over time. Quantitative data, however, did not as strongly support program effectiveness. Between the IY (n = 16) and control (n = 17) groups, foster parents were less likely to perceive their foster child in need of mental health treatment (p = 0.002), and changed their perception of their child's role in the family (p = 0.03). No between group differences were found for measures of child behavior or parent stress. Overall, these results suggest that trauma-informed IY for foster parents may provide unique peer support and increased confidence needed to implement strategies that can improve intra-family relations. Further research is needed to verify whether and how these relations are improved.

AB  - The study examined data about 8438 children placed in out-of-home care by Child Protection Services in a region in the Northern Italy, during the time span of 2008–2012, to understand whether out-of-home placements led to an effective improvement in their conditions. Starting from literature analysis and available data, a range of outcome and process typologies was developed in order to analyse data. In particular, five outcome types (in family, stable; out of family, stable; adopted; on-going placement; unknown) and six process types (evolving; regressive; oscillating; static out-of-home; uncertain at home; undetectable) were detected. Each type was divided into sub-types. Then each child was given a tag attuned to an outcome and a process type. Descriptive analysis about outcomes and processes was carried out. The types and sub-types used in the study seemed to be a useful instrument for analysing the children’s paths outside their birth families. Implications for social work are discussed. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Il presente studio ha preso in considerazione i dati relativi a 8.438 minori collocati fuori famiglia dai Servizi di Tutela minori in una Regione dell’Italia del Nord, nel periodo tra il 2008 e il 2012. Lo scopo della ricerca è stato quello comprendere se l’intervento di collocamento etero-familiare ha condotto ad un effettivo miglioramento delle condizioni di partenza. A partire dall’analisi della letteratura di settore e dai dati disponibili, sono state create delle tipologie di esito e delle tipologie di processo, attraverso cui sono stati esaminate le informazioni disponibili. In particolare, sono stati individuati cinque tipi di esito (in famiglia, stabile; fuori famiglia, stabile; adottato; intervento in corso; sconosciuto) e sei tipi di processo (evolutivo; involutivo; oscillante; statico fuori famiglia; incerto in famiglia; non rilevabile). Ciascun tipo comprende dei sotto-tipi. A ciascuno dei minori è stata assegnata un’etichetta corrispondente a un tipo di esito e a un tipo di processo, è stata quindi condotta un’analisi descrittiva degli esiti e dei processi. I tipi e i sotto-tipi utilizzati nello studio effettuato si sono rivelati uno strumento utile per analizzare i percorsi dei minori fuori famiglia. Nell’articolo si evidenziano le possibili implicazioni per il lavoro sociale.

AB  - Children adopted internationally are at risk for communication delays because of their history prior to adoption and the fact that they often do not share the same language with their adoptive parents. The purpose of this research was to study the effects of a Family-Guided Routines-Based Intervention (FG-RBI) program in teaching the parents of children adopted internationally to embed instructional strategies throughout their daily routines. Three parent-child dyads participated in a multiple baseline design study to improve communicative interactions within the context of everyday learning opportunities. Observations of behavior during three-minute videotaped routines revealed modest increases in the parents’ use of environmental arrangement strategies. Two of the three parents also learned to use contingent imitation as a responsive strategy. All parent participants agreed that the relationship-based intervention model was congruent with the unique needs of families who adopt internationally. Five parents who adopted internationally, but were not a part of the project, evaluated videotaped segments of parent-child interaction during baseline and intervention routines. Results of the social validity measure further substantiated the positive change in parent-implemented instructional strategies. This study contributes to the growing research base supporting FG-RBI and other parent-implemented approaches in early intervention. Even more so, it brings needed attention to the at-risk population of children adopted internationally. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - There are currently over 500,000 children in foster care in the United States. Foster care places them at a high risk for immediate and long term psycho-social-educational problems. In an effort to prevent some of the immediate behavior problems in foster children, an innovative intervention referred to as Transitional Group Therapy (TGT) was developed. TGT combines developmentally appropriate therapeutic interventions, psycho-education, and play therapy in a group milieu to facilitate resiliency. This study is the first phase of a best practices approach in which TGT was tested for its feasibility with 11 first-placement foster children, ages 6-11. Its research and development methodology employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. A challenge to the implementation of this program included systemic barriers to recruiting participants. Qualitative data and quantitative pre and post testing on the Child Behavior Checklist and the Behavior and Emotional Rating Scale offered promise of the TGT’S effectiveness. This preventive intervention in time may be viewed as providing a 'shot in the arm' to instill resiliency in first-placement foster children to help them survive their experience.

AB  - Research over the past 3 decades has shown that psychotherapy can successfully address adolescent depression. Cognitive behavioral models have been most extensively and rigorously tested, with evidence also supporting interpersonal psychotherapy and attachment-based family therapy. However, the vast majority of studies have focused on short-term treatment of depressive episodes, even as evidence accumulates that depression is frequently a recurring condition extending into adulthood. Moreover, treatment studies indicate that better longer term outcomes are attained by adolescents who respond earlier and more completely to intervention. Given what has been learned to date about adolescent depression treatment, future psychotherapy research should adopt a longer term perspective and focus on the following key challenges: (a) preventing relapse and recurrent episodes, while improving speed and thoroughness of initial treatment response; (b) identifying the necessary treatment components and learning processes that lead to successful and enduring recovery from depression; (c) determining whether-and, if so, how-to address comorbid disorders within depression treatment; (d) addressing the dilemma of simplicity versus complexity in treatment models. Given the relatively small number of evidence-based treatment models, newer approaches warrant investigation. These should be tested against existing models and also compared to medication and combined (psychotherapy plus medication) treatment. Advances in technology now enable investigators to improve dissemination, to conduct experimental psychotherapeutics and to expand application of Internet-based interventions to the goals of relapse and recurrence prevention.

AB  - The study compares the levels and predictors of resilience of maltreated adolescents in foster care with those of maltreated adolescents in residential and community care. Resilience was measured by the resilience subscale (RYDM) of the California Healthy Kids Survey, which defines the concept in terms of the existences of internal and external resources that enable healthy development. All three groups of youngsters reported relatively high resilience (2 on a scale ranging from 0 to 3), of all three types: internal, external, and general. The predictors of resilience tested in the study were type of placement, age, gender, acceptance and rejection by mother and father, and autonomy and control by mother and father. Only three variables contributed to the youngsters' resilience, all of them positively: being a girl, being older, and acceptance by the father. The study has two practical implications. One is that the adolescents' sense of themselves as resilient and possessing resources can be used in interventions aimed at helping them to overcome difficulties stemming from their maltreatment. The other is that the key role of parental acceptance, especially paternal acceptance, in the youngsters' resilience can be used in the work with both the biological and foster parents of maltreated youngsters.

AB  - Résumé Objectifs Aujourd’hui, l’intervention proactive au bénéfice de l’enfant en danger imminent, sérieux et réel, est conçue comme une nécessité évidente. Par contre, le malaise et le doute s’emparent du professionnel confronté aux suspicions de maltraitance, aux situations de négligence, à la « cruauté mentale » et certainement quand il s’agit de familles issues de milieux privilégiés sur le plan socioéconomique. Il est communément admis que plus une famille connaît des difficultés sur le plan socioéconomique, plus les individus les plus vulnérables du groupe, tels les enfants, sont menacés de négligence, voire de maltraitance. Les impacts sont observables tant auprès des protagonistes directement concernés qu’au niveau des différents intervenants impliqués. Ceux-ci adoptent et adaptent leur manière d’être en fonction, entre autres, de leurs représentations et émotions. Il n’existe pas à proprement parler de références bibliographiques sur la maltraitance qui survient spécifiquement dans les familles aisées et les modalités de prise en charge. L’objectif de cet article vise à repérer quelques caractéristiques des fonctionnements individuels et relationnels de ces familles comparativement aux systèmes familiaux précarisés. Méthode À partir d’une vignette clinique, l’auteur déploie une réflexion sur la maltraitance émergeant dans les familles privilégiées. Nous nous basons sur l’expérience de notre équipe SOS-enfants intégrée dans un hôpital général. Depuis 30 ans, les équipes SOS-enfants réparties sur le territoire national ont comme mission première d’établir le bilan complet de l’enfant suspecté être maltraité et de son entourage, ceci dans la perspective de mettre fin à l’inadéquation. La philosophie de cette intervention d’aide et de soins consiste, en rencontrant l’enfant et sa famille ainsi que les membres de leur réseau, à faire état des éventuels traumatismes et de leurs conséquences, et à proposer, le cas échéant, un plan thérapeutique adapté. Ce travail s’établit à l’amiable dans un esprit de collaboration et de transparence de notre part. Dans les situations de danger et/ou de refus patent ou déguisé de notre intervention par les responsables de l’enfant, une interpellation des autorités sociales, voire judiciaires est indiquée. Résultats Nous développons quatre axes, à savoir : (i) les relations avec le monde extérieur. La famille aisée est rarement « encadrée » par des services sociaux. À travers des discours bien construits et pertinents, les adultes tentent d’obtenir la main et de prendre le contrôle sur les velléités de tout professionnel chargé d’entrer dans le système sans leur autorisation ; (ii) le fonctionnement familial. Il s’avère en effet intéressant de repérer les modalités relationnelles qui sont à l’œuvre dans les situations de maltraitance intrafamiliale afin d’appréhender les éléments étiopathogéniques et de déterminer ainsi les axes thérapeutiques ; (iii) les attitudes générales de l’enfant-victime. Nous nous arrêtons au cas de figure de l’enfant pré-pubère qui dévoile la maltraitance à un tiers extérieur au cercle familial et nous décrivons plusieurs phases successives ; (iv) la personnalité du parent maltraitant. Selon le contexte socioéconomique, nous rencontrons plus fréquemment certains traits de caractère ou certaines manières d’être au monde et en relation intrafamiliale. Discussion L’article se poursuit en abordant trois éléments de prise en charge. Il n’existe pas à proprement parler de références bibliographiques sur la maltraitance qui survient spécifiquement dans les familles aisées et les modalités de prise en charge. Quelques recommandations peuvent néanmoins être pensées et proposées sur la base de notre expérience et d’un travail de réseau. Sont ainsi évoqués les modalités d’un cadre ferme et flexible à la fois, la pertinence d’un dispositif d’intervention basé sur la diffraction et l’importance accordée à la reconnaissance des compétences des familles et en l’occurrence celles des parents. Conclusion Construire une démarche diagnostique et thérapeutique doit tenir compte des éléments du cadre et du contexte dans lequel s’inscrit la famille rencontrée. En conséquence, il s’avère pertinent de concevoir des prises en charge adaptées. La maltraitance intervenant en milieux aisés n’échappe pas à de multiples enjeux et demande de la part des cliniciens finesse et ténacité. Des interventions bienveillantes visent la responsabilisation des protagonistes concernés en évitant soigneusement leur culpabilisation préjudiciable au lien thérapeutique. Objectives Today, proactive intervention in favour of children in imminent, serious and real danger is seen as an obvious necessity. However, professionals are uneasy and doubtful when confronted with the suspicion of ill-treatment, neglect or “mental cruelty”, and all the more so when it comes to families in privileged socio-economic situations. It is collectively agreed that the more difficulties a family encounters in the socioeconomic sphere, the more at risk are the most vulnerable individuals in the group, such the children, for neglect and even ill-treatment. The impact is observable both on the protagonists directly concerned and on the various other participants. The different parties adopt and adapt their manners of being partly on the basis of their representations and feelings. There are strictly speaking no bibliographical references on ill-treatment occurring specifically in wealthy families or on care provision in this setting. The objective of this article was to define some characteristics of the individual and relational functioning of these families compared with families in underprivileged settings. Method Using a clinical vignette the author reflects on the ill-treatment occurring in privileged families. This is based on the experience of our “SOS-enfants” team integrated into a general hospital. For thirty years, the “SOS-enfants” teams spread across the national territory have the main task of establishing a complete assessment of the child suspected of being ill-treated, and of his close circle, so as to address the shortfalls in care provision. The philosophy of this intervention of assistance and care, consisting in meeting the child and his family as well as the members of their network, is intended to identify possible traumas and their consequences, and to propose, where necessary, a tailored therapeutic plan. This work is performed in a spirit of friendly collaboration and transparency on our part. In situations of danger and/or obvious or disguised refusal of our intervention by the persons in charge of the child, social and in some cases judicial authorities can be called on. Results There are four lines of approach: (i) relations with the outside world. A “well-to-do” or wealthy family is rarely monitored by social services. Using well-constructed, well targeted discourse, the adults try to gain the upper hand and to take control over attempts by professionals asked to enter into their system without their authorization; (ii) family functioning. It is indeed interesting to detect the relational modes at work in situations of intra-family ill-treatment, so as to apprehend any aetiopathogenic elements and thus determine the therapeutic approaches; (iii) the general attitudes of the child-victim. We describe the scenario of a pre-pubescent child who revealed the ill-treatment to a third party outside the family circle, and we describe several successive phases; (iv) the personality of the mistreating parent. According to the family socioeconomic background, certain character traits or certain manners of being to the world are encountered more frequently. Discussion The article continues by discussing three aspects of care. There are no bibliographical references specifically on ill-treatment occurring in wealthy or well-to-do families, nor on modes of care. Certain recommendations can nevertheless be made on the basis of our experience and work in the network. Care provision should be at once firm and flexible. A plan of intervention based on diffraction appears relevant, and it is important to recognise the particular skills of families and in particular those of the parents. Conclusion Constructing a diagnostic and therapeutic approach needs to take account of elements of the setting and context in which family finds itself. It is therefore relevant to plan for tailored care. The ill-treatment occurring in privileged environments does not escape the many challenges raised, and it requires perceptiveness and tenacity on the part of the clinicians. “Friendly” intervention aims for the empowerment of the different protagonists, carefully avoiding making them feel guilty, which would be harmful to the therapeutic alliance.

AB  - Adopted children seem to imply specific challenge for themselves and their adoptive parents regarding the recovery of their attachment representations. Based on the hypothesis relating parental sensitivity of adopting parents and children's attachment representations, this study aims to create an intervention based on parental sensitivity for adoptive French-speaking families. Nine adoptive families took par to this study whose children are between 2 and 11 years old. In this exploratory research, the recovery of the children's attachment representations and the moderation of parental self-efficacy were assessed. Our results highlighted the relevance of this intervention. (C) 2013 Societe francaise de psychologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Children who have experienced early adversities are at risk for behavioral problems and trauma symptoms. Using a two-group, pre–post intervention design, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of an online parent training for Trust-Based Relational Intervention, a trauma-informed, attachment-based intervention, in reducing behavioral problems and trauma symptoms in at-risk adopted children. Children of parents in the treatment group (n = 48) demonstrated significant decreases in behavioral problems and trauma symptoms after intervention. Scores for children in a matched-sample control group did not change. Findings suggest this intervention can effectively reduce behavioral problems and trauma symptoms in children with histories of adversities.

AB  - Objective: The authors conduct a within intervention group analysis to test whether caregiver engagement (e.g., participation, homework completion, openness to ideas, apparent satisfaction) in a group-based intervention moderates risk factors for foster child outcomes in a state-supported randomized trial of caregiver parent training. Methods: The intervention is delivered in 16 weekly sessions by trained leaders. Outcomes are pre-post change in problem behaviors and negative placements. Results: Analysis of 337 caregivers nested within 59 parent groups show caregiver engagement moderates number of prior placements on increases in child problem behaviors, and moderates risk of negative placement disruption for Hispanics. Conclusions: Variance in parent group process affects program effectiveness. Implications for practice and increasing effective engagement are discussed. (Contains 4 tables and 2 figures.)

AB  - Research has increasingly focused on play as a social rather than a solitary domain. Play is a stage on which conflicts and wishes may be expressed to a responsive and containing other. As a group, late-adopted latency children show high levels of inhibition, regression and catastrophe in play, and adoptive parents may find this hard to engage with. The current study undertook a qualitative analysis of transcripts from groups run in the development of an adoption-specific parenting programme that emphasises play as a form of communication. Results indicate that adoptive parents habitually coped with play using counterproductive strategies that were predominantly avoidant or controlling; the programme facilitated some suspension of these defences. These findings are discussed with reference to children in therapy and individual work with their parents, who may be enabled better to support play through exploring their own conflicts and assumptions.

AB  - Noting the relatively little attention focused on linking child welfare practice with health care, early intervention, and other strategies that could effectively address the risks faced by young children in foster care, this policy paper is intended to challenge communities across the country to attend to the needs of children in or at risk of foster care placement. The paper highlights the special risks such children face and identifies strategies that service providers, courts, policymakers, and advocates can use to enhance the healthy development of young children in foster care and promote their prospects for permanency-- whether reunification with family or adoption. Key findings from research on young children in foster care are noted, in particular that a significant percentage of these young children do not receive basic health care such as immunizations; specialized needs resulting from developmental delays and emotional and behavioral conditions are even less likely to be addressed. The paper next details promising strategies to promote healthy development of young foster children, including providing developmentally appropriate health care, and creating monitoring and tracking mechanisms to ensure that needed health, developmental, and mental health services are provided. The paper then presents several action steps and key recommendations, such as harnessing the power of the courts to enhance foster children's healthy development; and developing explicit state and community-based strategies to ensure that young children in foster care have access to developmental health services, high quality child care including Early Head Start, and preschool and family support programs. The paper's two appendices list federal building blocks to improve the development of young children in foster care and program contact information. (Contains 51 endnotes.) (HTH)

AB  - Child psychology research has helped to identify how symptoms and deficits, or psychiatric needs impact the human experience, immediately and across development. Recent investigations indicate that strengths, both those possessed by the individual, and those present in her environment, exert short- and long-term protective influence that buffers the impact of needs. These findings help legitimate the emerging popularity, among providers and consumers, of strengths-based interventions for youth. Strengths-based interventions are derived from the system of care philosophy, a treatment model that aims to utilize individual and environmental resources in therapeutic processes. Preliminary research suggests that utilizing strengths in treatment promotes positive outcomes and that strengths-based interventions may be more effective than traditional, deficit-based services. Nonetheless, questions remain regarding the clinical utility of strengths. This paper suggests that answers to these questions can be approached by delineating the pattern of relationships between strengths and needs across time in an at-risk youth population. The excess of one half-million youth in foster care across the United States represents a group at high risk for undesirable outcomes. Thus, this study examines the longitudinal pattern of correlations obtained between strengths and needs in a sample of 868 foster care youth receiving System of Care services. Strengths and needs each were measured at specific and aggregate levels with the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) Assessment. Correlations obtained indicate that: strengths at Time 1 (T1) are correlated with strengths at Time 2 (T2), strengths and needs are inversely correlated at T1 and T2, and strengths at T1 are inversely correlated with needs at T2. T-tests for differences between correlations indicate that, at certain levels of strengths and needs: the correlation between strengths at T1 and T2 exceeds the correlation between needs at T1 and T2, the correlation between strengths and needs at T2 exceeds that at T1, and the correlation between strengths at T1 and needs at T2 exceeds the correlation between needs at T1 and strengths at T2. Results are translated into implications for policy development and service delivery. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Girls in foster care have been shown to be at risk for emotional and behavioral problems, especially during the preadolescent and adolescent years. Based on these findings and on the lack of research-based preventive interventions for such youths, the current study examined the impact of an intervention targeting the prevention of internalizing and externalizing problems for girls in foster care prior to middle school entry. Study participants included 100 girls in state-supported foster homes who were randomly assigned to an intervention condition or to a control condition (foster care services as usual). The intervention girls were hypothesized to have fewer internalizing problems, fewer externalizing problems, and more prosocial behavior at 6-months post-baseline compared to the control girls. The results confirmed the hypotheses for internalizing and externalizing problems, but not for prosocial behavior. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT Infants adopted from institutions experience inadequate care prior to adoption and are therefore expected to show elevated sustained social withdrawal behavior shortly after being adopted. Social withdrawal is expected to decrease as they adapt to their new families. Sustained social withdrawal was assessed 1 month' postadoption (Time 1) and again 6 months later (Time 2) via the Baby Alarm Distress procedure (A. Guedeney & J. Fermanian, ). At Time 1, 22.5% of the infants scored within the clinical range for social withdrawal whereas a significant decrease in social withdrawal was indicated at Time 2, with none of the infants scoring above the cutoff score. As predicted, maternal depressive symptoms and insecure attachment were associated with a smaller decrease in infants' social withdrawal. High maternal expectations for efficacy were associated with a smaller decrease in social withdrawal. Infants' temperament, gender, age at adoption, developmental level, and maternal marital status were unrelated to the level of change in social withdrawal. Participating in a preventive intervention was not associated with greater change in social withdrawal. These results highlight the beneficial effect of adoption and the role of maternal depression and attachment security in decreasing sustained social withdrawal among internationally adopted infants.

AB  - In this themed issue of the Journal of Prevention & Intervention in the Community, the first four contributions provide knowledge on factors that can support or hinder positive parenting throughout children’s lives. In particular, the first article examined the spillover of work stressors on parenting behaviors and the role of spousal support as a moderator of stress spillover. The second contribution examines the association between parents’ promotion of volitional functioning and adopted children’s sense of strength of family bonds and belonging to the adoptive family. The third article analyzes the negative impact of intrusive parenting on young adult children’s romantic relationship quality and couple identity, and the fourth article examines parents’ autonomous and controlled motivations to transmit values to their adolescent children and their associations with parents’ socialization goals. Finally, the last two articles present the contents and evaluation of two parenting programs. The fifth article illustrates the development, content, and efficacy of an attachment-based intervention for parenting: the Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD); the sixth article presents a qualitative evaluation of a group-based program focused on promoting parents’ identity together with parenting skills: The Groups for Family Enrichment_Parent version (GFE_P).

Current efforts to preserve maltreating families and prevent out-of-home placements of children are described, and research on their outcomes is reviewed. Implications for practice are drawn based on the proposed process model of child abuse and neglect and on research findings regarding the effectiveness of current family preservation treatment models with poor, maltreating families.

AB  - Many children who enter the care system and are subsequently adopted have had exposure to a range of potentially traumatising experiences including domestic violence, abuse, neglect and loss of key caregivers. There are also an increasingly high number of adopted children presenting with the impact of intrauterine exposure to alcohol, drugs and stress. They are often adopted by adults with their own experiences of loss and fertility difficulties. Despite the low overall level of adoption disruption, it is becoming clear that some adoptive parents may face difficulties in terms of forming and maintaining secure attachments across time with their children. A 9-week therapeutic group intervention was delivered to a group of 15 adoptive parents in Northern Ireland. This incorporated psychoeducation on a range of topics including attachment theory, trauma and the impact on brain development. It also incorporated theory and practical strategies for parenting therapeutically with traumatised children, and those with foetal alcohol and drug-related difficulties. The main focus of the group was on developing the capacity for mind-mindedness in the parents, through the more reflective focus of the second half of each group. The results from the evaluation indicated the positive impact of this intervention on parents' understanding of their children, increased confidence in parenting, and increased sense of competence in coping with challenging behaviour. It also indicated a positive change in the children's behaviour and in the parent-child relationships. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The quality of parenting is recognised as an important determinant of children's mental health. Parenting interventions typically target high-risk families rather than adopting a universal approach. This study examined the population impact of the Triple P Positive Parenting Programme on the prevalence of children's social, emotional, and behavioural problems. A propensity score matching difference-in-differences method was used to compare intervention and comparison regions matched on socio-demographic characteristics in midlands Ireland. The pre-intervention sample included 1501 and 1495 parents of children aged 4-8 years in the intervention and comparison regions respectively. The post-intervention sample included 1521 and 1544 parents respectively. The primary outcome measure was parental reports on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. There were some significant reductions in the prevalence rates of social, emotional, and behavioural problems in the intervention regions compared to the comparison regions. Children in the intervention sample experienced lower total difficulties, emotional symptoms, and conduct problems than children in the comparison sample, and they were less at risk of scoring within the borderline/abnormal range for total difficulties, conduct problems, and hyperactivity. The programme reduced the proportion of children scoring within the borderline/abnormal range by 4.7% for total difficulties, 4.4% for conduct problems, and 4.5% for hyperactivity in the total population. This study demonstrated that a universal parenting programme implemented at multiple levels using a partnership approach may be an effective population health approach to targeting child mental health.

AB  - All children who enter foster care have experienced disruptions in their relationships with caregivers, and many have experienced maltreatment. Studying the effects of these adverse early experiences can inform developmental theory. The quality of surrogate caregivers varies as a function of both the intervention services provided and foster parent characteristics. This paper considers salient developmental issues of infancy, preschool years, middle childhood, and adolescence and examines ways in which these issues may present special difficulties for foster children. Across development, foster care is associated with difficulties regulating behaviors, emotions, and physiology. Interventions have been designed that target developmentally specific manifestations of regulatory difficulties. Although the literature regarding evidence-based interventions for foster parents is quite limited, preliminary findings provide some evidence that nurturing, responsive care can serve to partially remediate early deficits. These findings suggest that stable and nonfrightening care is essential for normal development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - On the basis of our research findings from the last 10 years, we have developed a training program for foster parents that targets three critical needs for infants in foster care. This treatment program has now been manualized to allow dissemination to other sites. With our intervention as well as any other, we see it as critical to tailor services to the needs of individual clients rather than adhering in doctrinaire fashion to the manual. In particular, we suggest that attending to foster parents' state of mind with regard to attachment is vital to providing an effective treatment. In this article, we present examples of foster parents with different states of mind and describe how treatment is tailored to meet their individual needs.

AB  - Children who enter foster care have usually experienced maltreatment as well as disruptions in relationships with primary caregivers. These children are at risk for a host of problematic outcomes. However, there are few evidence-based interventions that target foster children. This article presents preliminary data testing the effectiveness of an intervention, Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up, to target relationship formation in young children in the foster care system. Children were randomly assigned to the experimental intervention that was designed to enhance regulatory capabilities or to a control intervention. In both conditions, the foster parents received in-home training for 10 weekly sessions. Post-intervention measures were collected 1 month following the completion of the training. Outcome measures included children's diurnal production of cortisol (a stress hormone), and parent report of children's problem behaviors. Children in the experimental intervention group had lower cortisol values than children in the control intervention. Also, the experimental intervention parents reported fewer behavior problems for older versus younger foster children. Results provide preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of an intervention that targets children's regulatory capabilities and serve as an example of how interventions can effectively target foster children in the child welfare system.

AB  - Studies with nonhuman primates and rodents, as well as with human children, have suggested that early separations from caregivers are often associated with changes in the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. On the basis of these findings, we designed a relational intervention that was intended to normalize HPA functioning among children in foster care. This paper presents findings from a randomized clinical trial that assessed the effectiveness of a relational intervention (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up [ABC]) with regard to HPA functioning. The ABC intervention was intended to enhance children's ability to regulate physiology and behavior. The control intervention (Developmental Education for Families) was intended to enhance children's cognitive skills. A comparison group of children who had never been in foster care was also included. Children's cortisol production was assessed upon arrival at the lab, and 15 and 30 min following the Strange Situation. Random effects analyses of variance were performed to assess differences in initial values and change between children in the two intervention groups. Children in the ABC intervention and comparison group children showed lower initial values of cortisol than children in the treatment control group, considering arrival at lab as initial values (p < .05). Groups did not differ significantly in change over time. These results suggest that the ABC intervention is effective in helping children regulate biology in ways more characteristic of children who have not experienced early adversity.

AB  - In this chapter, we discuss young children in foster care, as well as those adopted both nationally and internationally. Although children in these groups experience different challenges, they are all raised by someone other than birth parents for at least part of their lives. The following topics are discussed: experiences prior to placement in foster or adoptive care; factors affecting how children cope with adversity; challenges for children forming attachment to new caregivers; atypical attachments; effects of early adversity on the neuroendocrine system; caregiver commitment; open adoption and contact with the biological family; and interventions to enhance attachment among foster and adopted children. We include a discussion of animal models of separation and neglect, because they richly inform our understanding of the effects of infants' early experience.

AB  - Young children who enter foster care experience disruptions in care and maltreatment at a point when maintaining attachment relationships is a key, biologically based task. In previous research, we have found that young children experience challenges as they form attachments with new caregivers. They tend to push their new caregivers away, even though such children are especially in need of nurturing care. Further, many caregivers do not respond in nurturing ways when their children are distressed, which we have found is problematic for young children in foster care. We developed an intervention that is designed to help caregivers provide nurturance even when children do not elicit it, and even when it does not come naturally to them. This paper presents preliminary findings of the effectiveness of this intervention on children’s attachment behaviors. Forty-six children were randomly assigned to either the experimental intervention or to an educational intervention. For three consecutive days, attachment behaviors were reported across three distress-eliciting situations. Children whose parents had received the experimental intervention showed significantly less avoidance than children whose parents had received the educational intervention. These preliminary results suggest that the intervention is successful in helping children develop trusting relationships with new caregivers.

AB  - Children in foster care face a number of challenges that threaten their ability to form attachment relationships with foster parents and to regulate their behavior and biology. The authors describe the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up (ABC) intervention, an evidence-based intervention aimed at helping foster children develop trusting relationships with foster parents and develop better biological and behavioral regulation. The authors present research that led to the development of the ABC intervention, outcome research of randomized clinical trials, and a case example of a foster parent and child who participated in the ABC intervention. Finally, issues related to the broader system of care that are likely to affect children's adjustment (e.g., foster caregiver commitment and placement stability) are discussed.

AB  - We have developed an intervention protocol that helps parents to recognize children's problematic coping strategies and to encourage new ones, to overcome their own issues that get in the way of nurturing their children, and to create an environment that promotes children's biobehavioral regulation. In this chapter, we first describe research findings that have led to our intervention targets, then the intervention sessions and our approach to intervening with foster and birth parents of children who have experienced early adversity. The attachment and biobehavioral catch-up (ABC) intervention was developed to address several key needs of young children who have experienced adversity. Specifically, parents are helped to provide nurturing care even when children do not elicit it, and even when it does not come naturally; to behave in nonfrightening ways; and to provide a responsive, controllable interpersonal environment. The intervention was expected to help children develop secure attachments to parents more readily and to develop better regulatory capabilities. In randomized clinical trials, children in the ABC intervention group have shown more secure attachments and more normative Cortisol production than children in a control intervention.

AB  - In this paper, we highlight issues we consider key to the development of an evidence-based intervention for the parents of young children who had experienced early adversity. The intervention was initially developed for foster infants, but adapted for infants living with their neglecting parents, then for young children adopted internationally, and finally for toddlers in foster care or living with neglecting birth parents. The intervention and its adaptations share a focus on the importance of providing nurturance to children when they are distressed, and following children’s lead when they are not distressed. We approached intervention development from a theoretical position, with attachment theory and stress neurobiology central. But we are, at heart, clinical scientists and have been open to confirmation or disconfirmation of our ideas and hypotheses. In this paper, we describe our approach, discuss issues and challenges central to our work, and share advice for addressing similar issues and challenges. In diesem Artikel beleuchten wir Fragen, die wir für zentral für die Entwicklung einer evidenzbasierten Intervention für die Eltern von jungen Kinder halten, die frühe Widrigkeiten erlebt haben. Die Intervention wurde ursprünglich für Säuglinge in Pflegefamilien entwickelt, wurde aber dann für Säuglinge, die mit ihren vernachlässigenden Eltern leben, später für international adoptierte junge Kinder und schließlich für in Pflegefamilien oder bei ihren vernachlässigenden Eltern lebenden Kleinkinder angepasst. Die Intervention und deren Anpassungen teilen die Haltung, dass es wichtig ist mit den Kindern fürsorglich umzugehen, wenn sie belastet sind, und sich von ihnen leiten zu lassen, wenn sie nicht belastet sind. Wir entwickelten die Intervention aus einer theoretischen Perspektive, orientiert an der Bindungstheorie und der Neurobiologie der Stressreaktion. Jedoch sind wir im Herzen klinische Wissenschaftler und waren daher offen für die Bestätigung oder Widerlegung unserer Ideen und Hypothesen. In diesem Artikel beschreiben wir unseren Ansatz, diskutieren zentrale Fragen und Herausforderungen unserer Arbeit und geben Empfehlungen für den Umgang mit ähnlichen Fragen und Herausforderungen. In questo articolo, evidenziamo aspetti che consideriamo centrali per lo sviluppo di un intervento basato sull'evidenza per i genitori di bambini piccoli che hanno subito avversità precoci. L'intervento è stato inizialmente sviluppato per i bambini adottati, ma è stato adattato per i bambini che vivono con i loro genitori trascuranti, poi per i bambini adottati a livello internazionale, e infine per i più piccoli in affidamento o che vivono con i genitori che li hanno rifiutati alla nascita. L'intervento e i suoi adattamenti condividono il focus dell'importanza di fornire protezione ai bambini quando sono angosciati e di seguire le indicazioni dei bambini quando non sono angosciati. Abbiamo sviluppato questo intervento partendo da una posizione teorica, dove sono centrali la teoria dell'attaccamento e la neurobiologia dello stress. Ma siamo, in fondo, scienziati clinici e siamo stati aperti alla conferma o alla disconferma delle nostre idee e ipotesi. In questo articolo, descriviamo il nostro approccio, discutiamo le questioni e le sfide fondamentali per il nostro lavoro e condividiamo consigli per affrontare problemi e sfide simili. Neste artigo, destacamos questões que consideramos fundamentais para o desenvolvimento de uma intervenção baseada em evidências para os pais de crianças pequenas que experimentaram adversidades precoces. A intervenção foi inicialmente desenvolvida para crianças adotivas, mas foi adaptada para crianças que vivem com seus pais negligentes, e depois para crianças pequenas adotadas internacionalmente e, finalmente, para crianças pequenas em cuidados adotivos ou morando com pais biológicos negligentes. A intervenção e suas adaptações compartilham o foco na importância de proporcionar cuidados às crianças quando estão angustiadas e em seguir a liderança das crianças quando essas não estão angustiadas. Abordamos o desenvolvimento da intervenção a partir de uma posição teórica com base na teoria do apego e a neurobiologia central do estresse. Mas somos, no fundo, cientistas clínicos e estivemos abertos à confirmação ou desconfirmação de nossa ideias e hipóteses. Neste artigo, descrevemos nossa abordagem, discutimos questões e desafios centrais para o nosso trabalho, e compartilhamos conselhos para abordar problemas e desafios semelhantes. 在本文中，我們重點列舉為生命早期曾經經驗逆境的幼兒之父母，發展具實徵基礎的介入方案時，所考量的關鍵議題。此介入方案最早是為了寄養的嬰兒所發展，但是也曾修改用於與疏忽的親生父母同住的嬰兒身上，之後應用於跨國領養的幼兒，最後用於接受寄養照料的幼童或是與疏忽的親生父母同住的幼童。這項介入方案與其修改版本同樣著重在孩童苦惱憂傷時提供他們撫育，以及在孩子不苦惱時，跟循他們的引導之重要性。我們從依附理論和壓力神經生物學的理論角度，探討這項介入方案之發展。但是身為臨床科學家的我們，對於驗證或是未能驗證我們的想法和假設，抱持著開放的態度。這篇文章中，我們描述自己的方法、討論工作中核心的議題和挑戰，並分享處理相似議題和挑戰的建議。

AB  - Studied the impact of early intervention on parent-child relationships in 21 families whose children were placed in foster care between 1967 and 1977 because of a parental diagnosis of tuberculosis. Data on sociodemographic variables, clinical and psychological symptoms, support (therapeutic, social, medical, and parenting), and attitudes and interpersonal relationships were obtained from foster care records and semistructured interviews of 19 mothers and 6 fathers and 16 foster mothers. The results were used to construct profiles of natural and foster care parents. In general, despite ongoing social, medical, and educational support, the natural parents show ambivalence toward the foster care placement of their children, difficulties in relationships with their children, and a sense of competition with the foster care parents. Implications for evaluating the complexity of potential relationships among natural and foster care parents in situations, for developing adequate support for natural parents and their children, and for fostering cooperation between natural and foster parents are discussed.

AB  - In the past decades, an extensive body on early intervention research programs has grown with numerous scientific publications in the English language litterature, while such studies remain rare in France. This study reports the outcome of families whose children were followed in an out-patient treatment centre, the Unite de Soins Specialises et Domicile (USSD) in Paris. This institution, created in 1975, was designed to promote healthy parent-infant relationships and prevent difficulties for families exhibiting psycho-emotional and or psychiatric risks. The objectives are to enhance infant and early child development, to support parenting competences and to fight against intergenerational process of maltreatment and child placement. The theoretical references of the multidisciplinary team are the psychoanalysis, the attachment theory and the clinic of interactions. Thirty-height families were selected from the files of the USSD: They all had a child aged before the age of 18 months, born between 1985 and 1990 and were cared for more than one year; the other children received intervention after this age. Assessment of parents and children was made when the families had been out of treatment for at least five years. As it is a preliminary study without a control group, we have choose a psychosocial and comprehensive approach more focused on family issues than individual ones. For each child and family, institutional data were collected and argued with the all the professionals still present in the institution: admission in the institution, parental problems and infant symptoms (with reference to the DSM IV and the Zero-to-Three classification), therapeutic interventions (psychodynamic or interpersonal, parents-children groups, parental or children groups, home visiting...), child's re-educations, relationship with other social or psychiatric teams, orientation after the intervention. Thirty-one situations were re-evaluated. Standardized materials (WISC-R subtests, Rutter A scale for children, Nottingham Health Profile for parents) and semi-structured interviews were used for the assessments. Parental consent and administrative authorizations (for children in foster families or institutions) were obtained and interviews were registered. Two groups of families were studied. Group I included families without specific pathology, they received therapeutic intervention for a mean of 2 1/2 years, most of the mothers were depressed. It was composed of 2 sub-groups : in 8 families, the child's birth with severe perinatal problems had brought about the parental trauma, for 7 families, psycho-emotional problems were blew up again after the child's birth, signs of maltreatment could be detected. Group 11 included families at high risk for child abuse and neglect with numerous psychosocial stress, most of them were followed by social workers; interventions had lasted for a mean of 6 years. It was composed of two sub-groups: seven disorganized family situations with alcohol abuse and depressed mothers, and nine families with psychotic mothers, most of the babies were placed in foster care. We met 16 parental couples and 13 monoparental families twice and seven foster families. Twenty-five young people were interviewed and complementary information was obtained for seven others from the Child Protection services and foster agencies. Results focus on: 1) the families' present situation, healh representations and their social/relational and parental competences; 2) for the young people: the intellectual and scholastic competences, behaviour, social reltionships with their peers. They are presented in each of the sub-groups for parents and for children; differences and common points are noted in the two groups of families I and II. Mean ages at assessment were 12,3 years for children in group I and 13,3 in group II. Except in one case (children became Wards of the State), parents are able to carry out their responsibilities, totally in group I or partially in group 11 where it was shared with the Child Protection services for most children and adolescents were still placed. No serious child abuse or neglect was detected and there was a positive evolution for the parents' social and family relationships especially in group I. The family support is more precarious in group 11, counterbalanced by social and medical support. Concerning children and adolescents, two third are in the normal school system, the others are in classes for slow learners, one is in a day care hospital. A third have behaviour problems. For all of these young people, verbal subtests (Vocabulary and Similarities, were more succeeded than the performance subtest (Block Design), this result is associated with facilities in verbal expression showed during the interviews. The impact of early therapeutic intervention is notable among children of the families at high risk who had received such care before the age of one: the all have better social competences with peers, less behaviour problems and school failure than the others. Given these results, we can assume that early therapeutic intervention mediates psycho-social risk in these families. As this study is mostly descriptive, it should be followed by complementary research on larger populations. (c) 2004 Elsevier SAS. Tons droits reserves.

AB  - This qualitative study examined the parenting experience of seven participants who adopted children with histories of abuse. Goals were: (a) to explore the dynamics of this phenomenon from the parents' perspectives, (b) to explore the role of the participants' own working models of attachment in three domains (childhood, adult romantic and adult close friend relationships), and (c) to develop possible intervention strategies for families distressed by the experience and thereby at risk for adoption disruption or dissolution. Seven adoptive parents completed semi-structured interviews about their experiences; these were analyzed for thematic content using the Constant Comparative Method (Maykut and Morehouse, 1994). They also completed modified versions of three self-report questionnaires examining their conscious working models of childhood, adult romantic and adult close friendship attachments: (a) the Attachment History Questionnaire (Kessler & Pottharst, 1983), (b) the Attachment Style Questionnaire (Feeney, Holler & Hanrahan, 1994) and (c) the Relationship Questionnaire and Relationship Scales Questionnaire composite (Bartholomew, 2002), respectively. These were analyzed in a continuous rather than categorical manner. Also, portions of the interviews were analyzed for the unconscious working models of the participants' relationships with their own parents using the discourse correlates of the Adult Attachment Interview (George, Kaplan & Main, 1985) although the measure itself was not administered. While participants reported significant difficulties in their relationships with their adopted children, they felt the experiences to have made them better parents than they were prior to the adoptions. Participants reported relatively secure attachment relationships in both childhood and adulthood, but threads of insecurity throughout their attachment protocols appeared to be problematic in the parenting of their adoptive children. One such difficulty was a high need for self-reliance and independence, making it quite difficult for the parents to ask for help. Several expressed regret and the belief that, had they sought professional help earlier (or at all) when experiencing significant problems in parenting their adoptive children, these relationships might have been characterized by greater closeness and understanding. Based on the thematic material and researcher's clinical impressions, guidelines for social and therapeutic service delivery to families adopting children with pre-adoptive histories of abuse were generated. An important therapeutic intervention for family systems that become significantly distressed after the adoption of an abused child involves attempting to increase the reflective functioning of all family members (Fonagy, 1999). Psychoeducation, both to families and social systems (adoption agencies, schools, juvenile justice), addressing the relationship between abuse and attachment was also recommended.

AB  - Parents who have adopted children from state's custody are charged with parenting children who have experienced different aspects of trauma and loss. This trauma and loss often negatively impacts child behavior, which may leave parents confused, frustrated, and possibly at risk for adoption disruption or dissolution. This study surveyed 315 primary parents of children who were adopted from state's custody to predict parenting stress by assessing their adult attachment style, their perception of their partner's attachment style, and their reports of family functioning. Primary parents also answered demographic questions inspired by Rosenthal's (1993) study of seven predictive factors that predict adoption disruption. The Experiences in Close Relationships--Revised (R. Fraley, Waller, & Brennan, 2000) assessed adult attachment, while family functioning was measured using the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale IV (D. Olson, 2008). The Parental Stress Scale (Berry & Jones, 1995) accounted for the parenting stress of the oldest adoptive child. Using multiple regression, this study found higher levels of attachment-related anxiety and avoidance predicted parenting stress. Primary parents who perceived their partners to have higher levels of attachment-related anxiety and avoidance also predicted parenting stress. Finally, families who reported higher levels of family cohesion and flexibility significantly predicted less parenting stress. Results of this study indicate the importance of these assessments for agencies that place children, the need for parental support from friends, utilization of attachment and system-based interventions with clinicians working with adoptive families.

AB  - The population of children in foster care has nearly doubled in the past decade and grown more troubled and younger in age, while services to these youth and their families have become scarcer. Given their significant histories of maltreatment separation, and loss. these children are at risk for long-term psychosocial maladjustment. A central premise of this proposal is that much is now known about the early development of emotional and behavioral problems., and that it is feasible to develop and implement effective family-based preventive interventions for younger foster children that target antecedents. Based on a successful pilot study a larger scale randomized efficacy trial of the OSLC Early Intervention Foster Care Program (EIFC) is proposed. The EIFC program is a developmentally downward extension of the theory-based, empirically evaluated Multidimensional Specialized Foster Care program. The EIFC preventive intervention targets 4 co-occurring conditions in maltreated preschoolers in foster care: (1) behavioral problems; (2) attachment; (3) emotion dysregulation; and (4) developmental delays. In the proposed study, we will gather data from a 180 four-year-old children, 120 of whom are in the Oregon foster care system. Another 60 same-aged children living with their biological families will be included in a community comparison sample (CC). Foster children will be randomly assigned to either the EIFC experimental 12-month intervention condition (n=60) or a Regular Foster Care Condition (RFC; n=60). In the EIFC condition, four parenting strategies will be targeted: () consistent and teaching-oriented discipline, (2) sensitive responding to the child's cues, (3) monitoring and supervision of the child, and (4) positive reinforcement. Daily parenting practices are expected to mediate changes in child adjustment. The EIFGC program will also work with and collect data from biological parents and adoptive parents with whom children will be placed following discharge from the program. In contrast to the EIFC condition, in the RFC condition, it is expected that lower rates of positive reinforcement by the foster parents, resulting in deterioration of child adjustment and increasing the risk of disrupted placements as well as more negative outcomes in subsequent placements. Multiple assessments will be conducted over a 24 month period, allowing for examination of the immediate effects of the intervention as well as how children who have received the intervention fare in the transition to elementary school.

AB  - Children who have experienced dysfunctional early relationships may carry the internal representations they have developed of themselves and others into the new relationships with their adoptive parents, which can interfere with the very important task of developing secure attachment relationships with the adoptive parents (Lionetti, 2014; Bowlby, 1982). Adopted children have been found to have higher rates of insecure and disorganized attachment patterns compared to their non-adopted peers (van den Dries et al., 2009; Marcovitch et al., 1997). The interventions described in this article can be implemented both preventively, before the young child has reached the age at which they form an attachment relationship (i.e. by increasing the adopted parents' sensitivity), as well as with older children who may have already formed attachment patterns that are maladaptive.

AB  - For mothers of twins, the physical, psychological, and social changes that occur in the first year of motherhood are greatly intensified, often resulting in increased stress, feelings of inadequacy, and social isolation. This study used both quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the effects of a psychosocial support group intervention on mothers' of twins parenting stress and parenting sense of competency. Mothers with twins under 12 months of age self-selected participation in either a treatment group (N = 6) or comparison group (N = 6) and completed the Parenting Stress Inventory (PSI) and the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC) as pretest and posttest measurements. Treatment group mothers participated in a six-session, weekly psychosocial support group and were then interviewed in order to assess their perceptions of the group experience. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significantly greater decrease in level of parenting stress and increase in parenting sense of competence for the treatment group mothers than for comparison group mothers. The data gathered from the qualitative interviews revealed that treatment group mothers perceived the psychosocial support group to be helpful in lowering their levels of parenting stress and increasing their parenting sense of competence through offering psychological and emotional support, providing information concerning practical issues related to parenting twins, and fostering the development of a relevant network of social support. This study provides quantitative evidence of the benefits of participation in a psychosocial support group for mothers of twins, as well qualitative data concerning participants' perceptions of the components that contribute to a successful group intervention.

AB  - Atypical diurnal patterns of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity have been observed in samples of individuals following early life adversity. A characteristic pattern arising from disrupted caregiving is a low early-morning cortisol level that changes little from morning to evening. Less well understood is the plasticity of the HPA axis in response to subsequent supportive caregiving environments. Monthly early-morning and evening cortisol levels were assessed over 12 months in a sample of 3-6-year-old foster children enrolled in a randomized trial of a family-based therapeutic intervention (N = 117; intervention condition, n = 57; regular foster care condition, n = 60), and a community comparison group of same-aged, non-maltreated children from low-income families (n = 60). Latent growth analyses revealed stable and typical diurnal (morning-to-evening) cortisol activity among non-maltreated children. Foster children in the intervention condition exhibited cortisol activity that became comparable to the non-maltreated children over the course of the study. In contrast, children in regular foster care condition exhibited increasingly flattened morning-to-evening cortisol activity over the course of the study. In sum, improvements in caregiving following early adversity appear to have the potential to reverse or prevent disruptions in HPA axis functioning.

AB  - AbstractStudies with nonhuman primates and rodents, as well as with human children, have suggested that early separations from caregivers are often associated with changes in the functioning of the hypothalamus?pituitary?adrenal (HPA) axis. On the basis of these findings, we designed a relational intervention that was intended to normalize HPA functioning among children in foster care. This paper presents findings from a randomized clinical trial that assessed the effectiveness of a relational intervention (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up [ABC]) with regard to HPA functioning. The ABC intervention was intended to enhance children's ability to regulate physiology and behavior. The control intervention (Developmental Education for Families) was intended to enhance children's cognitive skills. A comparison group of children who had never been in foster care was also included. Children's cortisol production was assessed upon arrival at the lab, and 15 and 30?min following the Strange Situation. Random effects analyses of variance were performed to assess differences in initial values and change between children in the two intervention groups. Children in the ABC intervention and comparison group children showed lower initial values of cortisol than children in the treatment control group, considering arrival at lab as initial values (p?<?.05). Groups did not differ significantly in change over time. These results suggest that the ABC intervention is effective in helping children regulate biology in ways more characteristic of children who have not experienced early adversity.

AB  - Studies with nonhuman primates and rodents, as well as with human children, have suggested that early separations from caregivers are often associated with changes in the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. On the basis of these findings, we designed a relational intervention that was intended to normalize HPA functioning among children in foster care. This paper presents findings from a randomized clinical trial that assessed the effectiveness of a relational intervention (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up [ABC]) with regard to HPA functioning. The ABC intervention was intended to enhance children's ability to regulate physiology and behavior. The control intervention (Developmental Education for Families) was intended to enhance children's cognitive skills. A comparison group of children who had never been in foster care was also included. Children's cortisol production was assessed upon arrival at the lab, and 15 and 30 min following the Strange Situation. Random effects analyses of variance were performed to assess differences in initial values and change between children in the two intervention groups. Children in the ABC intervention and comparison group children showed lower initial values of cortisol than children in the treatment control group, considering arrival at lab as initial values (p < .05). Groups did not differ significantly in change over time. These results suggest that the ABC intervention is effective in helping children regulate biology in ways more characteristic of children who have not experienced early adversity.

AB  - The Chilean government commissioned a quasi‐experimental study with a pre‐/postintervention design that had two general aims: (a) to assess infants’ psychoaffective developmental levels (pre‐intervention phase) and (b) to evaluate whether an intervention based on the promotion of socioemotional development modifies the infant's psychoaffective development. Sixty‐two institutionalized infants and their alternative caregivers were evaluated at a pre‐intervention stage. An intervention then took place, with the caregivers trained according to an 'attachment sensitivity manual.' Results showed normal ranges of psychomotor development (64% normal, 9% delayed) and a very high frequency of attachment insecurity, as compared to the normative population (53%).The intervention significantly improved social orientation and object orientation as well as activity and reactivity levels. We conclude that although institutionalized infants in Chile do not exhibit high levels of atypical attachment, socioemotional deterioration may lead to vulnerability in present and future development. Finally, the scope of this study affected public policies regarding children, initiating a change to a foster family system and a variety of modifications in the strategies for adopting institutionalized infants.

AB  - Respite child care programs that provide temporary child care, support, and referral services to families of children with developmental disabilities are thought to be a critical component of formal social support interventions deemed necessary to promote healthy family functioning and prevent child maltreatment. This study describes sociodemographic characteristics, parenting stress levels, foster care placement, and founded child maltreatment rates in families of children with developmental disabilities who were using respite care services in a rural Midwestern state. Comparison of matched pre- and post-test Parenting Stress Index scores indicated significant decreases in Total Stress scores (t=3.27, df=86, p=0.0016), Parent Domain scores (t=3.55, df=86, p=0.0006), and Child Domain scores (t=2.2, df=86, p=0.02) following provision of respite care. Through logistic regression, it was determined that life stress, social support, and service level were significantly related to the occurrence of child maltreatment during enrollment ( p < 0.05). The investigator suggests that public health nurses can enhance their case management strategies when working with the parents of children with developmental disabilities by monitoring for caregiver burnout in addition to ensuring that the child is receiving care appropriate for his or her level of need.

AB  - This study examined relationships between characteristics of children adopted from the U.S. foster care program and measures of parenting, personal, and marital stress in their adoptive parents. An innovative Internet based data collection platform was used by 81 parents from across the U.S. recruited by their children's clinicians. Participants completed instruments related to demographic, social, emotional, and behavioral characteristics of their children along with self-report measures of parenting stress, marital stress, and personal mental health. Measures were also completed related to parent-child communication and parent-child relationship quality. As hypothesized bivariate analysis resulted in associations between aggressive-oppositional behavior, social competency, and hyperactivity-inattention behaviors with parent-child communication, relationship quality, parenting stress, and parental depression. The demographic predictor of total number of abuses children experienced prior to permanent adoption was correlated with parental depression and marital distress in parents. Measures of aggressive/oppositional behavior, social competence and hyperactivity/inattention contributed to 33% of the variance in the scores measuring parent-child communication. It appeared that social competency influenced parent-child communication in a unique way. Aggressive/oppositional behavior, social competence, and hyperactivity-inattention also influenced the quality of the parent-child relationship (14.5% of the variance) and parental depression (R square = .197). Earlier studies on the post adoption adjustment of children and stressors in their parents are discussed as well as implications for treatment and future research in the development of more effective strategies for working with this population.

AB  - Children in foster care are at heightened risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. This study examined differences in two areas that may be associated with many of these outcomes, emotion understanding and theory of mind, using a sample of 3- to 5-year-old maltreated foster children (n = 60) and a comparison group of same-aged, low-income, nonmaltreated children living with their biological families (n = 31). Being in foster care was significantly associated with worse emotion understanding and theory of mind capabilities, even when accounting for age, intelligence, and executive function. There were no significant associations between length of time in foster care, number of transitions, and emotion understanding and theory of mind. Results help to expand knowledge about the cognitive and affective deficits of children in foster care and suggest that interventions targeted at these deficits include an emphasis on emotion understanding and theory of mind.

AB  - This paper explores disrupted adoptions, contributing factors and intervention techniques. A general overview of the history of adoption in the United States is explored to help explain some of the common risk factors in adoption disruption. Both psychosocial stages of development and cognitive development are examined to help explain how delayed psychosocial and cognitive development may cause greater challenges for adoptive families. Additionally, this paper explores difficulties with attachment and bonding research, which results in a disproportionate number of adopted children diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder. Varied categories of 'special needs' are defined and the most common leading factors to disrupted adoption are identified. Emphasis is placed on contributing adoptive family dynamics that may impact the number of children susceptible to adoption disruption. Intervention strategies to decrease the number of disrupted adoptions are recommended within the research and by adoption professionals interviewed for this project.

AB  - This study examined the correlation between the various therapeutic foster parenting styles and foster child placement longevity. Research has suggested that foster children who have experienced multiple placements have greater difficulty with attachment and need more psychological services. Therapeutic foster parents play a critical role in providing stability for children in foster care. This study identified select characteristics about therapeutic foster parents that impact foster child placement longevity. The foster parent characteristics that were addressed in this study included therapeutic parenting styles, parenting experience level, presence of the therapeutic foster family's natural child(ren) in the home, and use of path analysis to differentiate the combination of parenting characteristics.

AB  - New York States initial attempt at individualizing services occurred within the context of an experiment. We randomly assigned children 5–12 years old who were referred for out-of-home placement in treatment foster care to either treatment foster care, Family-Based Treatment (n = 15), or to Family-Centered Intensive Case Management (FCICM) (n = 27). FCICM used teams of case managers and parent advocates to provide in-home services. Flexible service dollars, respite care, and behavior management skills training were available to assist teams in individualizing care. Preliminary outcomes indicate that children in FCICM are doing as well or better than children assigned to FBT in their functioning and symptom reduction. Parents of children in FCICM have made gains, although not at a statistically significant level, in behavior management skills and family strengths that allow them to provide care for their children at home.

AB  - Treatment foster care (TFC) is an appealing approach for treating youth with emotional and behavioral disorders because it combines the potential for intensive interventions with opportunities for growth and development in a family-based setting. To accomplish this, TFC requires treatment foster parents to simultaneously play roles of both substitute caregiver/parent and front-line professional. This requires that treatment foster parents excel at both the behaviorally focused elements of an interventionist while simultaneously enacting the more relationally-based aspects of a parent. To date there has been little in the literature to explore the extent to which practicing treatment foster parents actually utilize both behavioral and relational approaches in their work with youth. This paper uses baseline data from a randomized trial ( n = 247) to explore eight potential approaches that treatment foster parents might use (including: monitoring/supervision, approaches to discipline, consistency of responses to behaviors, time together, adult-child conflict, positive affect towards the child, perspective taking/empathy building, and communication) as well as a measure of their own assessment of their role. Results show that treatment foster parents recognize the complexities of their role, and most view themselves more as parents than as treatment providers. Substantial variation was evident on all examined dimensions of the treatment parent role (except supervision/monitoring). Variations in treatment parent approaches were most significantly related to child's age and their own view of their role. The paper concludes with discussion of implications and directions for future research.

AB  - The purpose of this dissertation project is to create a preventive parenting program for parents of toddlers. This program would educate parents on common developmental and behavioral issues of toddlers and incorporate aspects of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) to provide parents with sound interventions to toddler specific behavioral problems. The Parent-Toddler Relationship Enrichment Program aims to increase parental competence, reduce parental stress, and strengthen the parent-toddler relationship. The author chose to model part of the Parent-Toddler Relationship Enrichment Program after PCIT, because PCIT is a statistically validated intervention for toddler behavioral disorders, focuses on the parent as the main mediator of child behavior, has proven to have long lasting success over a variety of parent-child relationship problems, and its behaviorally oriented techniques are easily grasped and retained by most parents. The key, however, is to take this clinically based treatment and incorporate some of its theories and techniques in a preventive parenting program in order to reach a wider population before the parent-child relationship becomes dysfunctional. PCIT is an empirically validated parent focused treatment model designed for children ages two to seven with disruptive behavior disorders. The model of treatment is based on two phases: the relationship building phase, and the discipline phase. The relationship building phase is focused on enhancing the parent-child relationship by teaching parent specific techniques which foster a nurturing and secure bond with the child. The discipline phase focuses on teaching parents to effectively set limits and boundaries to reduce their child's negative behaviors. PCIT is conducted in a clinic setting in an average of fifteen to twenty sessions. The Parent-Toddler Relationship Enrichment Program is a unique preventive parenting program because it combines education of toddler development with principles and techniques of PCIT in a parenting program designed to reach a larger, non-clinic population before the parent-child relationship becomes problematic. The Parent-Toddler Relationship Enrichment Program will consist of three sessions held in a workshop format. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the shrinking funds for child welfare allocated primarily to investigation and foster care, prevention and treatment services for child maltreatment (CM) are increasingly nonexistent, inaccessible, or inappropriate. Prior research on help-seeking and service utilization has given scant attention to maltreating and at-risk families, who pose special challenges for service delivery for several reasons: maltreating families often do not recognize the development of problems in the parenting relationship; even if problems are recognized, the stigma associated with child maltreatment makes families reluctant to seek help; and service providers and client families often have different beliefs about what services are needed. A review of the literature on help-seeking and service utilization among populations at risk, in light of the social context of child maltreatment, suggests that research to identify specific parental concerns is needed in order to link prevention and treatment services to other services devised to meet clients' perceived needs. In addition, longitudinal research is needed to focus on the effects of social networks on the use of formal services and on the links between utilization of formal and informal services.

AB  - Among child welfare professionals there is agreement on the negative consequences for youth who age out of foster care without an attachment to a caring adult. There is a particularly challenging sub-population of youth in foster care at highest risk for this scenario: special-needs youth who reside in a congregate care setting and who have been freed for adoption. This paper details the “Parent for Every Child” initiative (PFEC), a federally funded diligent recruitment program which targeted special needs youth who resided in congregate care settings and who had been freed for adoption. PFEC had two primary objectives: 1) identify effective recruitment strategies for matching caring adults with youth in need of permanence and (2) improve permanency outcomes for youth in the target population, inclusive of both legal and relational permanence. The methods used for studying the initiative are described as well as the study's randomly assigned participants, inclusive of both intervention and control groups. Findings related to the initiative's main goals are presented with respect to: the various recruitment strategies employed by project staff and staff working in the control condition; the extent to which those efforts yielded “matches” between youth in need and potential resource families; and, the extent to which youth enrolled in the PFEC project had better permanency outcomes compared to youth in the control group. The limitations of the study are discussed as well as promising directions for future research in this area.

AB  - More than half a million children and adolescents reside in foster care within the United States (NDACAN, 2010). Many of these children have experienced abuse or neglect, which may predispose them to various mental health issues (Harden, 2004). The mental health needs of children and adolescents in foster care are significantly greater than children not in foster care (Austin, 2004). A significant mental health concern for those in care includes attachment-related difficulties. Foster care children are at a greater risk for the development of insecure attachments (Harden, 2004). A great deal of research supports that insecure attachments can be associated with negative, problematic outcomes (Lindhiem & Dozier, 2007). Furthermore, research demonstrates that foster parents are often not properly trained to manage the issues that children with attachment-related difficulties present with, resulting in lower foster parent satisfaction levels and multiple failed placements (Murray, Tarren-Sweeney, & Frances, 2010). Based on the literature, it is this author's belief that attachment-related difficulties in foster care children are an issue of significant importance. Given that many foster parent's report not being properly trained in managing the challenging social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties of a child with attachment-related issues, this increases stress and their ability to provide sensitive, empathic parenting. This in turn, negatively impacts the child and can further perpetuate attachment-difficulties (Dozier, 2005). Having the knowledge of how attachment-related difficulties can impact children provides a foundation for understanding and an opportunity for foster parents to modify their parenting skills to effectively meet the needs of these children. The developed manual is a psychoeducational training program designed to be implemented as a pre-service training for foster parents prior to obtaining their licensure. This six-hour training was developed by utilizing research on attachment theory and the role of attachment difficulties in foster care children, as well as researching effective interventions for parents to increase attachment security. This training program consists of a multi-modal format include role plays, questionnaires, group discussions, and lecture to educate foster parents on the role of attachment in foster children's difficulties with the goal of increasing their understanding of the foster child's experience. The training also consists of strategies the foster parent can utilize to effectively parent foster children experiencing attachment-related difficulties. This training also emphasizes the importance of ongoing support, the benefits of participation in a foster care support group, and provides additional foster parent resources. The implications and limitations of this training are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The extent to which foster families utilize social support on the Internet is examined in a sample of 34 foster families in a digital divide intervention program and a comparison sample of 30 foster families who were not part of the program. In spite of increased Internet access, the frequency of using online social support is low. A minority of parents and children increased their use of the Internet to give and receive help, communicate with other foster families and e-mail with their foster care worker. More than half of foster youth have used the Internet to stay in touch with friends and relatives and have "made a new friend" over the Internet. Implications for child welfare practice and for further research are discussed.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2000-02433-003[/rid]). The goals, objectives, and philosophy of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) are outlined in this article. Three specific mechanisms of the MTFC approach known to reduce conflict in the therapeutic milieu and to contribute to successful outcomes for youth and their families are described: a proactive approach to reducing problem behavior, the creation and maintenance of a consistent and reinforcing environment for the participating youth, and the separation and stratification of staff roles. Controlled outcome research comparing MTFC to other community treatment alternatives with similar populations of troubled youth are also described. Additionally, the results of preliminary research evaluating the impact of an MTFC model adapted to meet the needs of maltreated preschool-age children at entry to foster care are presented.

AB  - Preschool-aged foster children face multiple risks for poor long-term outcomes. These risks appear to increase with the number of placement changes experienced. The Early Intervention Foster Care Program (EIFC) targets the spectrum of challenges that preschool-aged foster children face via a team approach delivered in home and community settings. In this article, we report on permanent placement outcomes from the EIFC randomized clinical trial. Children in EIFC had significantly fewer failed permanent placements than children in the regular foster care comparison condition. The number of prior placements was positively associated with the risk of failed permanent placements for children in the comparison condition but not for children in EIFC. Type of prior maltreatment did not predict permanent placement outcomes. These results provide the foundation of an evidence base for the EIFC program as a preventive intervention to improve permanent placement outcomes for preschool-aged foster children.

AB  - Young children in foster care are exposed to high levels of stress. These experiences place foster children at risk for poor social, academic, and mental heath outcomes. The role of adverse events in stimulating neurobiological stress responses presumably plays a role in shaping neural systems that contribute to these problems. Systematic and developmentally well-timed interventions might have the potential to change developmental trajectories and promote resilience. Moreover, understanding how specific dimensions of early adversity affect underlying stress response systems and how alterations in these systems are related to later psychosocial outcomes might facilitate more precise and targeted interventions. Data are drawn from two ongoing randomized trials involving foster infants/toddlers and preschoolers. Consistent with prior animal models of early adversity, these studies have shown that early adversity—particularly neglect, younger age at first foster placement, and higher number of placements—is associated with altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. The interventions under investigation have produced evidence that it is possible to impact many areas that have been negatively affected by early stress, including HPA axis activity, behavior, and attachment to caregivers.

AB  - This study examined change in attachment-related behaviors among foster preschoolers participating in a randomized trial of the Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care Program for Preschoolers (MTFC-P). Measures of secure, resistant, and avoidant behaviors were collected using a caregiver-report diary at 3-month intervals during the 12 months following a new foster placement. Children randomly assigned to the MTFC-P intervention condition (n = 57) showed significant increases in secure behavior and significant decreases in avoidant behavior relative to children assigned to a regular foster care condition (n = 60). Both groups showed significant decreases in resistant behavior over time.

AB  - The aims of the present study were to examine the effects of a therapeutic intervention for foster preschoolers with histories of placement instability on permanency outcomes and to determine whether the intervention's effectiveness on these outcomes varied based on prior maltreatment experiences. Permanency outcomes for 52 children who had experienced 4 or more placements prior to study entry (n = 29 intervention condition; n = 23 regular foster care condition) were examined through 24 months post-study entry. The results indicated no group differences in permanency attempt rates but more than double the rate of successful permanency attempts for the intervention condition. The findings indicated that systematic interventions have the potential to impact permanency outcomes among children with prior instability.

AB  - Objective: Placement disruptions have adverse effects on foster children. Identifying reliable predictors of placement disruptions might assist in the allocation of services to prevent disruptions. There were two objectives in this study: (a) to replicate a prior finding that the number of daily child problem behaviors at entry into a new foster home predicts subsequent placement disruptions in foster preschoolers and (b) to determine whether this association is mitigated by a treatment foster care intervention. Method: Problem behavior and placement disruptions were examined in 60 children in regular foster care (age range = 3.10-5.91 years [M = 4.34, SD = 0.83], 58.3% male, 93.4% Caucasian) and 57 children in a treatment foster care program (age range = 3.01-6.78 years [M = 4.54, SD = 0.86], 49.1% male, 82.5% Caucasian). Using the Parent Daily Report Checklist (Chamberlain & Reid, 1987), a brief telephone interview, foster caregivers reported problem behavior 6 times over 3 months. Placement disruptions were tracked over 12 months. Results: The regular foster care children with 5 or fewer problem behaviors were at low risk for disruption, but their risk increased 10% for each additional behavior (p = 0.013). The intervention appeared to mitigate this "threshold effect"; number of problem behaviors did not predict risk of placement disruption in the treatment foster care group (p = 0.63). Conclusions: These findings replicate previous evidence linking child problem behavior to placement disruptions and further highlight the need for early preventative interventions.

AB  - Summary: Maltreated foster children often exhibit alterations in diurnal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activity that are characterized by lower cortisol levels upon waking and smaller declines in morning-to-evening cortisol levels. Previous research has shown that this dysregulated pattern is associated with high caregiver stress levels over the course of foster care placements. In contrast, therapeutic interventions that emphasize consistent and responsive caregiving have been associated with more regulated cortisol rhythms. In this paper, two related issues were explored: whether placement changes (i.e., moving between foster homes or from a foster home to a permanent placement) were associated with more blunted daily cortisol rhythms and whether a caregiver-based intervention exerted a protective effect in this context. Because the intervention program has components specifically designed to prepare foster children for placement changes and to maintain consistent parenting techniques despite them, a prevention effect on HPA axis dysregulation during placement changes was hypothesized. The results of linear mixed modeling analyses showed that placement changes predicted dysregulation in cortisol rhythms in the regular foster care group but not in the intervention foster care group. These findings are discussed in terms of implications for child welfare policy and practice.

AB  - The purpose of this 16-year study was to investigate the developmental progress of a group of children reared in severely deprived environments during infancy and early childhood in order to evaluate their adjustment to family, school, and community by age 15. The subjects were 31 children ranging in age from 1 year 7 months through 5 years 11 months who were placed in foster homes following a therapeutic program within the institution. The children's readiness for placement in foster homes was based on a demonstration of their capacity to relate to people with some emotional depth, a demonstration of their capacity for constructive effort through play, and a rating of mental health as measured by the "Flint Infant Security Scale" and the Pre-School Mental Health Scale. Data was collected from home and school records, measures of security, social maturity and intelligence, and responses on the Rorschach. Analyses of the data were made at ages 6, 9, 12, and 15, using the Security Theory of Mental Health. The results of the study showed that by age 15: (1) the group as a whole had developed a healthy capacity for in-depth affiliation with their foster families; (2) there was a three-year lag from the expected norm in the acquisiton of social maturity and a comparable lag in concept formation; (3) there was a one-year lag in school achievement; and, (4) the subjects emerged from common early intellectual functioning to assume a pattern which demonstrated functioning close to their own potentials.

AB  - Abstract: Permanency in placements and relationships of foster care children and youth is an important but challenging goal for public child welfare workers, social work practitioners, and social service providers. Research on at-risk children has repeatedly stressed the importance of continuity of attachment ties which is not always possible or desirable for children in foster care. Factors other than attachment and relationship continuity have been found to influence children''s adjustment and well-being such as school and peer experiences, leisure time activities and interests, and larger social environments. But there is little research on the impact of maintaining activities across placements and child wellbeing. This study surveyed 103 foster care parents asking questions about the child''s school, leisure, family, church, social, and therapeutic activities prior to and currently with the foster care family. The research found that the majority of foster care parents did not know about the child activities prior to placement in their home. It is not the increased number but the sameness of school activities that appears to improve the child''s well-being. More research is needed to find out from the foster care children what activities are meaningful to them and to see if maintaining these normalizing activities will impact placement disruptions.

AB  - Adoption-focused psychoeducation is deemed essential in maintaining the permanency of traumatized children within a new family unit. However, adoptive parents of traumatized children struggle to find training to address their unique concerns. Guided by the lens of psychodynamic theory, the purpose of this study was to investigate the challenges faced by adoptive families of traumatized children. Special focus was placed on the social and emotional relationships of the adoptive parents of traumatized children, to identify the realistic expectations towards attachment from the families' perspectives. Fifteen families were randomly selected to participate in this study from a group of 30 parents who adopted traumatized children in Arizona. A phenomenological approach was utilized to gather information from face-to-face and telephone interviews. The data analysis utilized the horizontalization approach which highlighted significant statements that were classified into codes. Thematic categories were drawn and summarized. Textual descriptions evolved from the thematic groups acknowledging their experiences and how these lived experiences guided their decision to adopt a traumatized child. Verification techniques, data mining, journaling, clustering, brainstorming, and peer reviews were used to ensure the quality of data. Emergent themes emphasized the need for adoption-focused training specific to traumatized children. Further research on this phenomenon should determine the significance of specialized psychoeducational training versus general foster care training, before and after adoption. Positive social change may result in tailoring existing training programs to meet the needs of families who adopt traumatized children. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research has shown that children in foster care are a high-risk group for adverse economic, social and health related outcomes in young adulthood. Children's poor school performance has been identified as a major risk factor for these poor later life outcomes. Aiming to support the design of effective intervention strategies, this study examines the hypothesized causal effect of foster children's poor school performance on subsequent psychosocial problems, here conceptualized as economic hardship, illicit drug use, and mental health problems, in young adulthood. Using the potential outcomes approach, longitudinal register data on more than 7500 Swedish foster children born 1973–1978 were analyzed by means of doubly robust treatment-effect estimators. The results show that poor school performance has a negative impact on later psychosocial problems net of observed background attributes and potential selection on unobservables, suggesting that the estimated effects allow for causal interpretations. Promotion of school performance may thus be a viable intervention path for policymakers and practitioners interested in improving foster children's overall life chances.

AB  - The Foster carer--Foster child Intervention (FFI) was developed to help foster carers recognise and cope with the stress that foster children under the age of five might experience when placed in a new family. Children who have been neglected or abused may have difficulty coping with stress and develop behavioural problems, and young children in particular can develop passive avoidance behaviour as a way of adapting to their new situation. The FFI aims to improve the interaction between foster carer and foster child by optimising the emotional availability, parenting skills and confidence of carers in a way that makes the child feel more secure. This article by WH van, Andel Hans Grietens and Erik J Knorth explains the aims and principles underlying FFI and discusses its theoretical background, which includes attachment theory, psycho-education, mindfulness therapy and video interaction training. It then details the intervention and describes how it is being implemented in Dutch foster care practice. The article ends by outlining an ongoing randomised control study to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.

AB  - On the basis of our research findings from the last 10 years, we have developed a training program for foster parents that targets three critical needs for infants in foster care. This treatment program has now been manualized to allow dissemination to other sites. With our intervention as well as any other, we see it as critical to tailor services to the needs of individual clients rather than adhering in doctrinaire fashion to the manual. In particular, we suggest that attending to foster parents' state of mind with regard to attachment is vital to providing an effective treatment. In this article, we present examples of foster parents with different states of mind and describe how treatment is tailored to meet their individual needs.

AB  - The research reported here by Gemma Laybourne, Jill Andersen and John Sands offers further insight into an 18-session training programme for foster carers based on the attachment needs of foster children. The programme was originally developed by clinical psychologist Kim Golding, and evaluated by Golding and Picken in 2004. A revised version was later made available for purchase under the title Fostering Attachments in Young People who are Looked After and Adopted (Golding, 2006). Further to the initial evaluation, the present study also suggests positive results from evaluating this attachment-focused programme, especially in terms of the information obtained via continuous verbal feedback from carers throughout the training, from some of the objective measures employed and from semi-structured interviews conducted with carers after programme completion. It appears that this form of group work may be beneficial to carers, helping them to develop their knowledge and understanding of the needs of children with attachment difficulties and reducing some of the stress they experience when caring for their foster children. Of particular interest to the reader may be the reported impact of the training on the relationship between some of the foster carers and their spouse/partner (not included in the training). The implications of this issue and other evaluation-related issues are discussed.

AB  - The absence of typical caregiving, including warm and responsive parenting, has been suggested to significantly affect the young child’s ability to form adaptive relationships with adults and peers. The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), a randomized controlled trial of foster/family care for young children with a history of institutionalization has provided the context to assess these relationships. Here we review data from the BEIP with specific focus on attachment. The findings clearly show the importance of early family care on the emergence of attachment, on the prevention of psychopathology, and on links between brain and social behavior.

AB  - The present study examined the sequelae of attachment for 557 children in foster care. Children at high risk for insecure attachment and children at low risk for insecure attachment were compared on social, behavioral, and cognitive measures. It was hypothesized that social competence (communication skills and social skills) and behavioral adjustment (total number of behavior problems, internalizing behavior, and externalizing behavior) would be closely associated with attachment risk group, and gender differences would be observed in the high-risk group. Cognitive functioning was also hypothesized to be associated with attachment but to a lesser degree than either social competence or behavioral adjustment. Results of the study confirm that attachment risk group was associated with social competence and behavioral adjustment, but not with cognitive functioning. Children who were considered to be at high-risk for insecure attachment were rated as being less socially competent and demonstrating more externalizing, internalizing, and total behavior problems than children at low-risk for insecure attachment. Although these differences were statistically significant, the mean scores for both attachment risk groups were within the normal range on all measures, and therefore, the practical difference in applied settings between these groups would probably be minimal. Girls demonstrated significantly greater communication skills than boys, regardless of attachment group. A non-significant interaction was observed between attachment risk group and gender for social skills; girls in the low risk group scored substantially higher than boys in the high risk group. Gender differences were not noted on any of the three behavioral variables. Effect sizes for the findings were small; raising the question of whether being at high- or low-risk for insecure attachment has practical significance for at-risk children in foster care. Implications for interventions with children in foster care and attachment theory, limitations to the current study, and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - How best to support children and young people in foster care remains a challenge for child welfare. There has been little Australian research on the outcomes for children and young people placed in therapeutic foster care (TFC). This article aims to address this knowledge gap, presenting the evaluation of a state‐wide model of TFC known as the Circle Program operating in Victoria, Australia. Data sources for the study were case assessment analysis; surveys of foster carers, program workers and other stakeholders in the sector; and both focus groups and individual interviews with foster care workers. The evaluation found that the Circle Program lessened the number of unplanned exits of children from foster placements compared with generalist foster care. Another important finding was that the Circle Program positively influenced foster carers' decisions to stay in the carer role. Key components perceived as contributing to outcomes of the Circle Program included enhanced training of foster carers, intensive carer support, specialist therapeutic support to the child and carer, therapeutic service to family members and a network of services to provide support to the child.

AB  - Child welfare practitioners and researchers' are faced with the daunting challenge of ensuring children in foster care successfully transition into adulthood. In fact, for many of the youth who experienced prior history of chronic abuse and placement instability, the likelihood of experiencing negative mental health, employment, and education outcomes increase. Due to the fact that research focusing on the experiences of foster care alumni of color is limited, existing interventions to address their negative developmental outcomes may not be effective. The Latino Child Welfare Research and Practice (LCWRP) Model (Garcia, 2009) provided a conceptual framework to aid in identifying areas that warrant further attention for this study. Incorporating the individual/social and institutional domains of the model and utilizing data from the Casey National Foster Care Alumni study, this study addressed the following primary questions: 1) Does chronicity of child maltreatment and cumulative familial risk factors impact foster care alumni's mental health outcomes, and if so, are they moderated by race/ethnicity? 2) Do positive coping mechanisms (high self-esteem and ethnic identity) mediate the relationship between individual stressors during childhood (chronic abuse, cumulative risk factors, and placement instability) and being diagnosed with a mental health disorder during adulthood? 3) Controlling for placement instability, does access to services and agency preparation for leaving foster care uniquely predict developmental outcomes among Latino, Caucasian, and African American foster care alumni? Finally, this dissertation study, from the perspective of front line caseworkers, also examined barriers and challenges Latino children and families experience in the child welfare system. Relying on mixed methods (logistic regression, multiple group structural equation modeling, and grounded theory) to address these questions, this dissertation study offers valuable contributions by: 1) examining unique predictors of developmental outcomes among foster care alumni of color, 2) highlighting strengths and areas where improvement in child welfare practice is needed to ensure foster care children and adolescents receive evidence based, culturally sensitive services to thrive as adults, and 3) exploring factors that may mitigate negative developmental outcomes and contribute to timely permanency and reunification among Latinos in the child welfare system.

AB  - The current study examined the effect of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), a parent-training intervention for child behavior problems, on child language production. Participants were 46 children (ages 20–70 months) with externalizing behavior problems and with or at risk for developmental delay. Parent–child dyads were randomly assigned to a waitlist control or immediate treatment group. Parenting skills learned during PCIT (i.e., 'do skills') and children's word tokens and word types were measured at baseline and 4 months later. Findings suggest an indirect effect of parent do skills on the relation between group and child word types, such that more parent do skills predicted more child word types for families receiving PCIT. The present study found that mothers' use of child-directed skills played an important role in the growth and improvement of child language. Results suggest that parent-training interventions targeting child behavior problems may also foster child language production. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Foster children manifest a high incidence of externalizing behavior disorders compared with children from the general population and these problems are associated with unplanned disruptions in foster care placement. This study is a randomized trial (Treatment vs. Waiting list) for investigating the efficacy of a short enhanced cognitive– behavioral group parenting program delivered to Romanian foster parents (N = 97) for reducing externalizing behavior disorders in foster children, increasing placement stability, and reducing foster parents' emotional distress. Results supported the efficacy of the program, as compared to the waiting list, in treating child behavior problems and reducing parental emotional distress, but no differences were found regarding placement stability between the two groups. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of designing and delivering viable parent interventions aimed at reducing externalizing disorders in foster children and unplanned placement disruptions.

AB  - Foster children manifest a high incidence of behavioral problems compared with children from the general population and these problems are associated with unplanned disruptions in foster care placement. This study is investigating the efficacy of a short cognitive-behavioral parent program delivered to foster parents having in placement children with aggressive behavior for increasing placement stability and foster parent's quality of life. The trial had a randomized controlled comparative pre-post design and the intervention combined components from the most validated parent programs for child defiant behavior in the literature, focusing on providing foster parents with child development information/ psycho-education, parental stress reduction, parenting skills, problems solving skills and efficient communication skills. Results are supporting the efficacy of the program in improving the quality of life in foster parents after the treatment, but no differences were found regarding placement stability between the parental cognitive-behavioral group and the waiting list. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of incorporating the advancements in evidence-based parental interventions to making available viable parent interventions to Romanian Child Welfare System for reducing the rate of unplanned placement disruptions and increasing the quality of life in foster parents having in placement children presenting disruptive behavior.

AB  - Background: In spite of the proven effectiveness of parenting based programs to prevent adolescent risk behaviors, such programs are rarely implemented in Mediterranean countries. Objective: This pilot study was aimed at assessing the feasibility and the effects of a parenting based universal prevention program (Connect) in Italy. Methods: Our sample comprised 147 mothers and 147 youths, aged 11-14 (M = 12.46, SD = 0.72). We adopted a quasi-experimental design. Forty percent of the parents in the sample were in the intervention condition (receiving 10 one hour lessons a week). ANCOVAs and Cohen's d coefficients were used to compute intervention effects. Results: The results showed that, despite difficulty in recruiting parents, the program held promising effects regarding the prevention of alcohol use at a universal level (Cohen's d = 0.55); the intervention also marginally decreased the level of non-empathic answers from parents, at least in the short term (Cohen's d = 0.32). Conclusions: This study highlighted the importance of focusing on families to prevent problem behaviors in adolescence. It also points to the need for new strategies to engage parents in universal prevention.

AB  - Postadoption services are an expanding service sector. This study determined the characteristics of families and children using a postadoption services program in New England. On average, children were 11 years of age at case opening and had been adopted for 6 years. Most had a history of maltreatment (57%), were adopted domestically (67%), and lived in adoptive families with married parents (82%). Almost all had received at least 1 other postadoption service (90%) and many (47%) had received 4 or more. Families' greatest concerns were child development and family relationships, with fewer concerns about culture, race, or birth parents. Although managing their children's behavior was a concern, families reported feeling effective and expressed considerable closeness to their child. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Children who leave care into adoption and special guardianship are often considered by schools and local authorities to have found their "happy ending." Yet there is growing evidence that the impact of prenatal and early trauma, abuse and neglect does not disappear upon placement in a permanent family. Rates of social, emotional and mental health difficulties remain high, and the group has pronounced educational needs. Whilst having high levels of involvement with education and health services, families report significant difficulties in mobilising understanding, support and provision. In the context of growing numbers of children in England finding permanence through adoption and special guardianship, and the Department for Education's increasing focus on addressing the needs of this group, this paper highlights the key role of Educational Psychology Services in supporting adopted and other permanently placed children by providing training, consultation, assessment, intervention and research for children and their families, their schools, and the local authorities.

AB  - This pilot study examines changes in diurnal cortisol in response to the start of school for three groups of children: foster children who received regular foster care (RFC); foster children who received Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (MTFC-P); and low-income, nonmaltreated children living with their biological parents (community comparison [CC]). MTFC-P makes use of a multidisciplinary team: family therapists, foster caregivers, foster caregiver consultants, and behavioral specialists to facilitate development of social and behavioral competencies in foster preschoolers. Diurnal cortisol slope across days was examined using a repeated-measures ANOVA with group as a between-subjects factor and gender as a covariate. Child age and grade level were not included in the final models as they did not affect the results or significantly predict cortisol slope. The RFC group demonstrated a steeper cortisol slope on the 5th day of school, primarily due to higher morning cortisol levels, compared to the CC group. Researchers have also hypothesized that individual differences in coping emerge upon repeated exposure to stressors, resulting in greater associations between individual characteristics and the cortisol response to later exposures. In addition to differences in temperament, early life stress may influence the response of the HPA axis to the 5th day of school. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Comments on an article by L. Murray et al. (see record [rid]2015-39446-001[/rid]). After many years of neglect the message is finally out that early childhood is critically important and has long-term effects on individual and maybe even 'national' development. The South African intervention by Murray et al. began in pregnancy and continued to 6 months of age and was aimed at improving maternal sensitivity and attachment. Attachment did improve but there was no overall benefit on the children’s mental development. The authors suggest that improving maternal sensitivity and attachment may not be sufficient to improve cognition, and opportunities for learning need to be added. Another important question posed by the South African intervention is what is the most effective age to begin interventions? Studies of children in residential institutions provide useful information on sensitive periods. Adoption is a comprehensive intervention and Romanian children in residential institutions adopted before 6 months had no measured long-term deficits. All these topics need to be explored further and the paper by Murray et al. adds useful information. Follow-up is needed to determine if the improvement in attachment is sustained and whether any of the other benefits develop, particularly those in behaviour and mental health.

AB  - Findings from Maryland KEEP, a replication of KEEP (keeping foster and kinship parents trained and supported), a foster and kinship parent training intervention are presented. The purposes of this study were to evaluate child behavior change, changes in caregiver parenting style, and permanency and placement stability at baseline and then after the KEEP intervention. The KEEP intervention was provided to 65 foster and kinship parents providing care for children ages 4-12. Children who participated in the study were referred due to behavior problems, as reported by foster parents: they all scored in the clinical range for externalizing behavior on the child behavior checklist (CBCL). Baseline and posttest analyses assessed for child behavior and parenting style changes. Permanency data, including placement moves and exits from child welfare were examined. Overall, foster and kinship parents reported significantly fewer child behavior problems at posttest; severity levels on the CBCL decreased from baseline to posttest and scores on the Parent Daily Report decreased from 7.25 at baseline to 3.0 at posttest. Placement stability significantly increased between baseline and post KEEP intervention. The results provide support for the effectiveness of KEEP for a child welfare population with a high level of behavior problems and for the effectiveness of KEEP as a training program for foster and kinship parents.

AB  - Abstract: This paper describes the history of using images in infant development as well as in describing infant psychopathology, firstly through the use of still pictures, then with movies and with video. There has been, to our knowledge, very few papers describing the history of the use of images and movies in infant psychopathology, as well as the growing use in infant development studies and in parent-infant intervention programs. The pioneers in the field of infant psychopathology and early development have been using movies extensively to convince colleagues of the existence of such early troubles. The paper presents a summarized history of the use of images and films by Arnold Gesell, who was the first to use films to document infant development. René Spitz, James and Joyce Robertson, and John Bowlby had an enormous influence on the field in describing through films and the effects of separation on young infants, with the film Grief, a peril in infancy by René Spitz and the series of films by Robertson and Bowlby among which John, a two years old, goes to nursery is the most famous. In France, Myriam David and Geneviève Appell have used films to document the effects of institutionalization and to promote change within infant mental health professionals. The “modern period” in the use of video to describe parent–infant relationships is initiated by Berry Brazelton, then with Cohn & Tronick and the Still Face Paradigm. In the same period, developmental psychologists are making a growing use of video, with the use of sophisticated sequence analysis software, as well as software enabling for following gazes. This review then reviews the principal intervention programs heavily depending on the use of video within work with parents and infants. Susan Mc Donough is clearly the pioneer of the use of video within interactional guidance. She has shown how this can be incredibly effective in building and enhancing a therapeutic alliance, particularly with “hard to reach” and “hard to keep in touch with” families. Intervention programs as “Seeing is Believing” have shown effectiveness and efficiency both in intervention and in prevention, but also programs designed for prevention of attachment disorganization in adopted infants. Our early prevention study (CAPDEP), modelled after David Olds Elmira study, have used video to enhance the effectiveness of home based, attachment oriented interventions for high-risk families. We have used George Downing''s experience and frame of work and analysis of video making with parents and infant. This paper concludes on the growing use of video in daily clinical work with infants, in clinical research, in supervision, in training and teaching as well as in early prevention and intervention and for a transmission process.

Il présente une histoire résumée des pionnier de l’utilisation de l’image avec des jeunes enfants, Gesell, Spitz, James et Joyce Robertson, John Bowlby, et en France, Myriam David et Geneviève Appell. La période moderne est inaugurée par Brazelton, puis Tronick, alors que les psychologues du développement précoce utilisent de plus en plus la vidéo. Ce travail se centre ensuite sur l’impact qu’a pu avoir l’utilisation du film et de la vidéo dans les études expérimentales de développement précoce, mais aussi dans la clinique des interactions précoce ; on mentionne les principaux programmes d’intervention et de prévention précoces qui utilisent la vidéo comme outil essentiel ; Susan Mc Donough est sûrement la pionnière de la guidance développementale assistée de la vidéo. Elle a décrit de façon très convaincante comment l’utilisation de clips courts centrés sur le bébé permet d’aider à construire une alliance de travail, particulièrement dans les familles à difficultés multiples, en ce centrant exclusivement sur les aspects positifs. George Downing a proposé une méthode de proposition des vidéos, d’édition et d’analyse et de restitution, qui s’applique aux parents de jeunes enfants mais aussi aux enfants, adolescents et aux familles. Ce travail se conclut sur son utilisation croissante dans le cadre des interventions préventives et précoces. </ce:abst (French) [Copyright 2012 Elsevier] Copyright of Neuropsychiatrie de l'enfance & de l'Adolescence is the property of Elsevier B.V. and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Describes the effectiveness of the Foster Parent Skills Training Project, a joint venture between a state university and a state public welfare department, in training individuals (a) to teach foster parents better communication skills and methods of managing children and (b) to increase the parents' acceptance of their foster children's individualities and viewpoints. The trainers' workshop covered 37 working hours and used films, small group, dyadic, and triadic practice sessions during which participants alternated between speaking and listening skills as a means toward mastering the communication and parenting skills that trainers will teach the parents. Trainers also learned their specific responsibilities as group leaders. 42 persons participated in and evaluated the training program. Results suggest that given a structured, proved foster parent training program and solid, though brief, preparation in group leadership skills and program content, child welfare agency personnel, from foster parents to directors, can offer training that results in satisfactory outcomes for both parents and trainers.

AB  - Compared a group of 56 foster parents trained in a 10-wk, 20-hr program involving psychological helping skills with a no-contract control group of 28 foster parents. It was hypothesized that the trained group would show greater improvement than the controls with respect to (a) showing accepting attitudes toward the foster children in their care, (b) being able to employ parenting responses defined as desirable, and (c) being able to refrain from using parenting responses defined as undesirable. Both groups completed the following measures at a 10-wk interval: a family information questionnaire, the Porter Parental Acceptance Scale (PPAS), and either Form I or Form II of the Sensitivity to Children Questionnaire. The 1st hypothesis was confirmed with a significant Treatment by Time interaction involving higher PPAS scores. Hypothesis 2 was confirmed via a significant interaction of Treatment by Time. Hypothesis 3 was supported in that mean uses of undesirable parent response scores of trained Ss decreased significantly while those of the controls increased significantly.

AB  - Abstract: This mixed method study describes the cultural adaptation, implementation and impact of a mental health intervention for individual rural children aged 7–17 from methamphetamine-involved families who are in foster care. Features of the culturally-shaped intervention include: 1) close collaboration with local professionals who provide the intervention over a seven month period; 2) provision of the intervention in and around children''s homes; and 3) the use of local storytelling traditions in a narrative- and relationship-based intervention. As a group, children (N=15) showed problematic levels of Childhood Behavior Checklist (CBCL) externalizing and total problem behaviors and symptoms of PTSD/dissociation during the pretest. Children were randomly assigned to an experimental group who received the intervention immediately (n=8), or a wait-list control group (n=7) who received the intervention at the end of the study. There was a significant interaction effect of time (pre and post test) and group on externalizing behavior with the trajectory of the experimental group improving while that of the control group worsened. Gains made by the experimental group were maintained over a seven month follow-up period. Comparative case studies, individual qualitative interviews and open-ended questionnaires provided rich elaboration of participants'' experiences and illuminated complexities and challenges of the intervention.

AB  - Background: Although exposure to early life stress is known to affect mental health, the underlying mechanisms of its impacts on depressive symptoms among institutionalized children and adolescents have been little studied. Methods: To investigate the role of attachment and self-esteem in association with adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and depressive symptoms, 342 children (149 boys, 193 girls; age range 9-18 years old, mean age= 13.5 ±2.4) living in residential foster care facilities in Japan completed questionnaires related to internal working models, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Their care workers completed questionnaires on ACEs. Results: Structural equation modeling (SEM) was created and the goodness of fit was examined (CMIN = 129.223, df= 1.360, GFI = .959, AGFI = .936, CFI = .939, RMSEA = .033). Maltreatment negatively predicted scores on secure attachment, but positively predicted scores on avoidant and ambivalent attachment. The secure attachment score negatively predicted depressive symptoms. The ambivalent attachment score positively predicted depressive symptoms both directly and through self-esteem, whereas the avoidant attachment score positively predicted depressive symptoms only directly. Maltreatment neither directly predicts self-esteem nor depressive symptoms, and parental illness/death and parental sociopathic behaviors did not predict any variables. Conclusions: Results show that the adversity of child maltreatment affects depression through attachment styles and low self-esteem among institutionalized children. Implications of child maltreatment and recommendations for child welfare services and clinical interventions for institutionalized children are discussed.

AB  - This is an evaluation focusing on the effectiveness of the Solihull Approach foster carer training group programme ‘Understanding your foster child’. Four groups were run, of 12 weekly sessions with a total of 56 foster carers. All foster carers who attended completed both pre and post measures, however incomplete data sets were removed, so in total 27 data sets were analysed. Four questionnaires were used: Parental Stress Index Short Form (PSI-SF), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Carer Questionnaire and the Children’s Expression of Feelings in Relationships (CEFR). Statistical analyses identified that after the group, there were significant increases in foster carers’ ratings of their understanding of their children’s difficulties; their understanding of why foster children behaved the way they did; their feeling of having the required skills to manage difficulties; alongside significant decreases in their ratings of foster children’s hyperactivity and attentional behaviour difficulties.

AB  - Presents a treatment model that is grounded in the notion that in cases where attachment issues are paramount, indirect work with parents may be more effective than direct work with children in the early years of treatment. The authors argue that in order to protect children from a multitude of treating professionals, thereby potentially further weakening the emerging parental attachment, this model proposes indirect treatment of children with the adoptive parents as co-therapists. The analysis presented in this article is based on a case study of an intervention in which a therapist undertook therapeutic work in collaboration with adoptive parents and is controversial in child mental health work as it challenges traditional hierarchies. This model is referred to as Parent Co-Therapy (PCT). It is proposed that this may be a suitable treatment model for fostered and adopted children, particularly in the early years of placement. The authors conclude that the model has the potential to strengthen the children's attachments to the parents and vice versa, with a concomitant reduction in symptomatology.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine clinicians' opinions on the appropriateness of using filial family therapy, also known as child relationship enhancement family therapy (CREFT) with adopted children and their families. Filial therapy has been very successful in treating various behavioral and emotional difficulties in children. Research indicates that adopted children can experience various difficulties, mostly related to issues with attachment. The foundation of filial therapy rests on the notion that parents are effective change agents for their children due to the natural parent-child bond that exists between them. In an adoptive family, the parent-child bond may not be formed naturally or may look different than that of a biological parent-child relationship. This study investigated whether professionals within the filial therapy field use this type of treatment with adoptive families, their reasons for this decision, common variables they consider when making this decision, and their thoughts on the appropriateness of filial therapy with this population. This study utilized a qualitative method. Ten clinicians who have conducted, researched, and/or written on the topic of filial therapy were recruited through the Association for Filial and Relationship Enhancement Methods, Inc. (AFREM). Participants were also gathered via snowball sampling. Data was collected by means of a semi-structured interview. The data from the interviews were aggregated into six themes through the use of inductive data analysis. The themes that were identified in this study were consistent with the literature on play therapy, filial therapy, and adoptive families. Ninety percent of the participants supported the use of filial therapy with adoptive families in producing positive changes within the family due to the attachment-building components of filial therapy. The majority of participants reported that their preference for using filial therapy with adoptive families is related to the need to build the attachment between the adopted child and his or her parents in order to improve problem behaviors within the parent-child relationship. This study adds a professional opinion to the filial therapy literature; a voice that is largely missing from the research. This study also supports the success of using filial therapy with adopted children, as it has been established that this is a population in need of effective treatments. Limitations of the study were addressed and recommendations were made for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This project describes application of an evidenced-based, trauma-informed treatment framework, Attachment, Regulation and Competency (ARC), with adopted children impacted by complex trauma and their caregivers. Results demonstrate that ARC treatment was associated with significant decreases in child symptoms and caregiver stress from pre- to post-treatment, which were maintained over a 12-month follow up period. Preliminary findings contribute to an emerging empirical basis for the ARC model and are supportive of its clinical utility as a practice with adopted children. Next steps include; a) expanding study findings by conducting controlled efficacy research, b) examining the transaction between child and caregiver factors as agents of change, and c) conducting longitudinal research of children and families receiving ARC to more deeply examine impact on resiliency.

AB  - At first the development of the mother-child-attachment is discussed on the basis of the theories of Bowlby and Ainsworth. A study by one of the Dutch authors (Juffer) is described, in which the quality of the attachment was assessed in 90 foreign adoptions and in which a positive impact of interventions (booklet, discussion of videotapes) on the quality of the attachment was found. Then the relationship between adoptees and their biological parents is discussed. The consequences of the `'double parenthood'' for the identity development of adopted children is described.

AB  - The psychoanalytically informed work of a team of workers at a drop-in centre for families in a poor district of Lima is described. Interventions involve: accepting, connecting, playing and empowering. Clinical vignettes are used to illustrate the ways in which these interventions aim to help families. The acceptance of difficult feelings provides containment for attendees; acceptance of individuality fosters a greater capacity to mentalise. In viewing the patient as the relation between parents and child, connections are forged and encouraged between family members. Questions and difficulties that parents express are relayed to children in a palatable way, modelling the inclusion of children in the family dialogue. Playing is advocated and encouraged and elements of the fluid ‘frame’ impact on how playful interactions are shaped. Empowering takes place through encouraging reflexivity and dissolving fantasies of passivity. Questions about child behaviour are reflected back to the questioner or to other attendees, and pathologising diagnostic terms, if raised by families, are challenged and investigated, rather than accepted, encouraging families to carry on thinking. The implications of this model of work are discussed.

AB  - For over three decades, placement stability of children in foster care has been a serious concern for policy makers as well as the general public. Frequent placement disruption has been found to have negative impacts on children's psychological development and educational progress. Yet, a substantial proportion of children in foster care have experienced three or more placements while they are in foster care. The objective of this dissertation is to examine the effects of guardianship subsidy availability on placement stability for a cohort of children in the Maryland Guardianship Assistance Demonstration Project (GAP) who were placed with relative caregivers before May 2000 in Baltimore City. The evaluation of GAP was a true experiment in which study participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. Members of the experimental group were eligible for a monthly subsidy for guardianship participation. Members of the control group, on the other hand, were ineligible for the subsidy. This study examines the differential effects of the eligibility of the subsidy on placement stability between four distinctive groups of children who were placed in Kinship Care at the beginning of the project and in the absence of the subsidy: (1) Those who would remain in Kinship Care in the absence of the subsidy; (2) Those who would move to restricted foster care in the absence of the subsidy; (3) Those who would exit out-of-home care through guardianship in the absence of the subsidy; and (4) Those who would exit out-of-home care through reunification. Subgroups are defined using the propensity score matching method and number of placement changes is examined using a Poisson regression model. The study did not find any subsidy effects on placement stability regardless of children's permanency outcome in the absence of the subsidy. This dissertation demonstrates that propensity score matching has the potential to improve sample balance. The estimates of program effects obtained with the propensity score methods, however, are sensitive to the selection of predictors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Several studies have shown that foster and adopted children have high risk of developing severe mental health problems (Blome & Steib, 2004; Golden, 2009; Leslie, Hurlburt, Landsverk, Barth, & Slyman, 2004; McMillen. Scott, Zima, Ollie, Munson, & Spitznagel, 2004). On the other hand, evidence-based models are limited and less accessible for practitioners working with foster and adopted children (Dorsey, Kerns, Trupin, Conover, & Berliner, 2012). The goal for this study is to explore the practitioners' evaluations of Theraplay®, which is a relationship based model for meeting the pervasive clinical needs of foster and adopted children and their families. Exploring Theraplay in the social work field is meaningful because of its popularity among social workers and the substantial number of clients successfully treated with Theraplay. With Theraplay, attachment theory and neuroscience are applied to understand the necessity of attachment-based models in meeting the needs of foster and adopted children. A mixed-method research design was selected for this study. It best answered the study's research questions with higher response rates and provided an in-depth exploration in this study (Groves, Fowler, Couper, Lepkowski, Singer, & Tourangeau, 2004). The survey data (N=87) were collected at the 6 th International Theraplay Conference on July11-July 12, 2013 in Evanston, IL. The survey included a demographic questionnaire, which presented questions about the extent of their evaluations of Theraplay, the use of Theraplay in practice, and the Theraplay competency assessment with a case vignette. One case study was also analyzed for in-depth information. Two focus groups (N=10, 9 respectively) were conducted and the participants were asked to address Theraplay practice and their experiences in the treatment of this population. The results of the statistical methods (descriptive statistics, correlations test, and one-way ANOVA) found that there is positive association between the levels of practitioners' Theraplay training and the effectiveness of the use of Theraplay for helping foster and adopted children and their families. There is also positive association between the practitioners' levels of competency and the effectiveness of the use of Theraplay for helping foster and adopted children and their families. The case study is an overarching picture of Theraplay practice and highlights the factors in Theraplay that leads to positive therapeutic outcomes. The study found that the therapeutic factors increased parent-child healthy connections, increased self-regulation of the child, parents' increased understanding of their child, and gained skills in parenting. Finally, the findings from the focus groups illustrated that Theraplay helps children build a positive internal working model. It helps parents gain insights and skills for helping their children's emotional and behavioral issues and it is an effective tool for practitioners to help foster and adopted children and families. This research has practical, theoretical, and research implications for social work practice, education, research, and training. These findings have potential to aid many stakeholders: foster and adopted children and their families, clinical social workers, foster and adoption workers, policymakers, and researchers. Informed by the researcher's own clinical experience and expertise through substantive training in the field of Theraplay, this research can be a prototype of the meeting points for clinical, theoretical, and research work in the field of social work.

AB  - The Family Oriented Structured Preschool Activity (FOSPA) program, an Early Childhood/Family Education program for parents and their 4-year-old children, is described. FOSPA is a nationally validated Title III, Elementary and Secondary Education Act demonstration project in the St. Cloud Community Schools district of Minnesota. Based on research findings that the early years are critical to a child's development and on the belief that parents can benefit if the educational community is willing to help them in their parenting role, the FOSPA program focuses on the quality of the parent-child relationship, the development of a competent and resourceful child, and support for parents in their parenting role. Parents and their children come to a center-based program once a week for 2 hours per session for approximately 25 weeks. At the center there is time for parent-child interaction and time for parents to meet separately with other parents and a parent educator. Children interact with each other and with the early childhood teacher in structured activities and free play. Activity kits, designed to teach cognitive skills to the children and to enhance the parent-child relationship, are available for families to take home. This report contains information on the program's philosophy and objectives, program activities, curriculum materials, activity kits, learning stations, evidence of effectiveness, community awareness, dissemination, budgets, and criteria for adoption elsewhere.

AB  - Adoptive parents can be unprepared for challenging behaviors exhibited by their adopted children. Often, these behaviors stem from histories of trauma, and typical parenting practices can be ineffective, leaving parents overwhelmed and at risk of disrupting the adoption. This preliminary study investigated the effects of implementing trauma-informed intervention training with traditional post-adoption services. Results showed a reduction in children's psychiatric problems, as well as parents' own stress levels, when parents demonstrated an investment in the intervention model.

AB  - The aim of this three-paper format dissertation is to explore how the well-being of foster children of parents with substance abuse problems is defined and promoted through Family Dependency Treatment Courts (FDTC) within the context of the Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA). The benefit to the author of the three-paper method is the task of submitting the findings of the study for publication is eased as the dissertation contains three stand-alone articles. A drawback for the reader of the three-paper method is that there is redundancy in reading the same sections in each paper. The reader is encouraged to keep in mind that some information may be redundant when read as a whole document. The first paper is a policy analysis of ASFA. It specifically aims to analyze the mandates of ASFA as they pertain to the well-being of foster children of parents with substance abuse problems. One approach to implementing the mandates of ASFA is through Family Dependency Treatment Courts (FDTC). FDTCs serve parents with substance abuse and dependency problems that have contributed to the removal of their children from their care. Papers two and three report the findings of a grounded theory study conducted in FDTCs. Paper two aims to define well-being, and postulates a theory to that effect, titled Emotional Permanence (EP). Paper three postulates a theory of Fostering as a basic social process that FDTC interdisciplinary teams use to promote the well-being of parents with substance abuse and dependency problems and their children. Although each paper is independent, the three are connected by the common theme of the well-being of foster children of parents with substance abuse problems.

AB  - Attachment theory is a theory of personality development in close relationships and helps us understand why children who have suffered adverse relationships in their early years go on to find relationships difficult in the future. It is no surprise when parents of foster children consider some to be resistant to all efforts and attempts at closeness in any relationships and/or experience their behavior as extremely difficult to manage when they demonstrate a desperate need to manipulate and control their environments. While the use of narrative and story stems is not the only tool used in assessment, story stems are a useful tool as part of assessment and during any brief intervention which aims to gain clues to a child's functioning and difficulties which will provide indications as to what type of care the child may need, and what type of support the foster parent may need. Once assessment has been completed, if the child's support systems are deemed to be secure, then play therapy can be offered. Play therapy goes on to continue to use story formats, actively help the child develop more adaptive coping strategies, challenge cognitive distortions, and rely less on negative behavior to communicate distress. This chapter in particular sets out to describe how play therapy techniques were used to assess and assist with understanding the difficulties of three foster children who were experiencing problems with their current placement, in school and relationships generally, to the extent that the placement was at severe risk of breakdown.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine factors that contribute to adoption success and adoption disruption based on parental attachment security. This study, a quantitative cross sectional survey approach, investigated the relationship between adoptive parents' attachment security, and their decision to promote adoption stability and success or to seek adoption disruption. A three phased recruitment process was used to recruit 62 participants in North Central Texas and Washington State: Phase I (Agency Recruitment), Phase II (Participants within Agencies), and Phase III (Snowball Effect). Data were collected from the participants' responses to the Adoptive Parent Demographic Data Sheet (see Appendix C), Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (Horowitz, Alden, Wiggins, & Pincus, 2000; see Appendix D), and The Brief FAM III (Skinner, Santa-Barbara, & Steinhauer, 1983; see Appendix E) as instruments. Data were analyzed using statistical t-tests, Pearson correlations and Chi-Square Tests within the Statistical Packages for Social Studies (SPSS) computer software program. Open ended data, from the participants' responses to seven open ended questions placed at the end of the Adoptive Parent Demographic Data Sheet, were analyzed for additional information on the variables and categorized into themes.

AB  - An estimated one third of American children witness domestic violence. Attachment theory predicts children exposed to domestic violence are vulnerable to experiencing problems with security of attachment to parents. When the child needs comforting and protection, the mother has become a victim and is unable to protect herself. The child is likely to experience fear with no solution. The current study examined indicators of attachment security in internal working models of preschoolers who witnessed domestic violence. Their representations were examined for qualities of attachment security, insecurity, and disorganization/disorientation, as well as, how representations relate to domestic violence. The study examined 94 preschoolers (66 clinical participants exposed to high domestic violence and 28 children from the community with less exposure). The constructs examined included: Internal representations based the MacArthur Story Stem Battery (MSSB). A report of the child's socio-emotional well-being was collected using Achenbach's Child Behavior Check List. A retrospective report profiled domestic violence using Straus's Conflicts Tactics Scale. The Parent Infant Relationship Assessment Scale (PIRGAS) assessed the mother-child relationship. The WPPSI-R was used to assess verbal ability. Univariate correlational relationships among independent variables showed: Children's parent representations include positive qualities that foster secure attachment less than half the time, making it likely that these children have insecure attachment. Characteristics of the representations of these children converge with prior empirical findings regarding the characteristics of the representations preschoolers with disoriented/disorganized attachment classifications. Paternal representations were complex and contained both positive and negative qualities. Children exposed to higher levels of domestic violence, produced fewer father representations. The maternal representations were primarily positive and appear to promote felt-security. The MSSB measures demonstrated internal validity. The MSSB showed some but limited external validity using the CBCL and PIRGAS. The limitations of self-report by a clinical sample may be contributing to invalid CBCLs. Clinicians can use this research to identify sources of distress in the parent-child relationships of preschoolers exposed to domestic violence in order to guide therapeutic interventions to provide more effective treatment.

AB  - Repetitive, intrafamilial abuse and neglect leads to a complex array of deficiencies and symptoms that reflect both the traumatic effects of maltreatment on children as well as the effects of their failing to develop a coherent pattern of attachment behaviours toward their caregivers. This article will attempt to describe principles of a psychological treatment for maltreated children and young people who have been placed in foster care and adoptive homes. This treatment, based on attachment theory, provides dyadic interventions that aim to be transforming and integrative. The co-regulation of affect and the co-construction of meaning are central to the treatment process, just as they are central features in attachment security.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the effects of the Webster-strauon parenting program on the parenting skills of maltreating mothers and on the autonomy of their children (3-8 years). Method: A randomized controlled trial was used. Twenty-six maltreating families were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the 16-hour weekly intervention group, or the 4-month wait list control group. Pre- and post- intervention independent assessments included a 2-hour home visit involving videotaped mother-child interactions during two prescribed, lU-minute play activities. Results; Compared to the control group, treatment mothers demonstrated significant improvement in involvement and marginally significant improvement in autonomy-support, but no improvement in structure. Treatment group children showed no significant improvement in autonomy when compared to control group children. Conclusions: This parenting program proved effective with maltreating parents. The lack of demonstrated effect on children may reflect the need for a larger and more sustained treatment dose and/or the need to include parent-child interaction opportunities in the program. At the same time, while treatment gains were limited to the parent, the high treatment adherence rate (92% attended six or more of the eight program sessions) and low attrition rate (n = 1) indicate that the treatment gains may hold potential for more thorough examination. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objetivo: Este estudio analizó los efectos del programa de formación de padres Webster-Stratton en las habilidades parentales de madres maltratantes y en la autonomía de sus hijos (3 a 8 años). Método: Se utilizó un diseño experimental con selección aleatoria. Un total de 26 familias maltratantes fueron aleatoriamente asignadas a una de dos condiciones: (1) el grupo de intervención de 16 horas semanales o (2) el grupo control en "lista de espera" por cuatro meses. Las evaluaciones independientes pre y post-intervención incluyeron una visita al hogar de dos horas de duración que implicaba la realización de una grabación en video de la interacción materno-infantil durante dos actividades de juego programadas de 10 minutos de duración. Resultados: Las madres del grupo de tratamiento, en comparación con las madres del grupo control, demostraron una significativa mejora en "implicación" y una mejora marginalmente significativa en "apoyo-autonomía", pero una ausencia de mejora en "estructura". Los niños del grupo de tratamiento no mostraron una mejora significativa en "autonomía" cuando se les compara con los del grupo control. Conclusiones: Este programa se demuestra efectivo con padres maltratantes. La falta de efecto demostrado en los niños puede reflejar la necesidad de una dosis de tratamiento más largo y/o la necesidad de incluir oportunidades de interacción materno-infantil en el programa. Al mismo tiempo, mientras las ventajas del tratamiento de limitan a los padres, la alta tasa de adherencia al tratamiento (92% acudieron a 6 o más de las 8 sesiones del programa) y la baja tasa de abandono (n = 1) indican un potencial importante. (Spanish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Objectif: Cette étude examine comment le programme Webster-Stratton affecte les compétences parentales de mères abusives et l'autonomie de leurs enfants (âgés de 3 à 8 ans). Méthode : On a utilisé un processus aléatoire où 26 families abusives ont été soumises à l'un de deux programmes, soit un groupe hebdomadaire comprenant 16 heures de programmation ou un groupe contrôle dont la liste d'attente était de quatre mois. On a mené des évaluations avant et après le programme, comprenant une visite à domicile de deux heures où les interactions de jeux entre mère et enfant ont été enregistrées sur vidéo, pour une période de 10 minutes. Résultats: Comparé au groupe contrôle, les mères ayant bénéficié d'une intervention ont démontré des améliorations importantes au niveau de leur engagement auprès de leur enfant et des améliorations d'une certaine importance au niveau de leur appui de l'autonomie de l'enfant. On n'a noté aucune amélioration au niveau de la structure de leur interaction. Les enfants dans le groupe ayant bénéficié d'une intervention n'ont démontré aucune amélioration significative au niveau de leur sens de l'autonomie, comparés au groupe contrôle d'enfants. Conclusions: Ce programme de développement des compétences parentales s'est avéré positif pour les parents maltraitants. L'absence d'effets positifs sur les enfants pourrait s'expliquer par le fait qu'ils ont besoin d'une intervention plus complète et plus soutenue et/ou que le programme devrait comprendre un volet qui encourage l'interaction enfant-parent. En même temps, bien que le programme ait bénéficié principalement les parents, il faut se rappeler que l'adhérence importante des parents au programme (92% ont assisté à six ou plus des huit sessions) et le taux d'attrition (n = 1) inférieur indiquent que les avantages de ce programme d'intervention devraient être examinés de plus près.

AB  - Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP) is a relationship-focused therapy characterised by a strong therapeutic alliance, empathy and unconditional positive regard. It seeks to treat the complex psychological problems of looked after and adopted children as they struggle to develop a greater measure of stable functioning in their homes. It was developed by Dan Hughes based on his extensive clinical experience of working with children and families together and is rooted in a close study of relevant theory. DDP can help children who have been hurt and/or neglected within their families in their early years by supporting them to recover from previous trauma and to experience attachment security and emotional connection within their current family.As with any developing therapy, questions have been raised about its clinical relevance and effects. One such critique recently appeared in an article by <xref>Mercer (2014)</xref> and this will be used to demonstrate how misunderstandings, misinterpretations and the selective use of case studies can lead to misguided views of this important innovation. This article particularly addresses inaccuracies in accounts of the development of DDP as an intervention for looked after and adoptive children and their families, how DDP is practised around the world and how theory underpins the model. Although a lack of evidence derived from robust evaluations is acknowledged, the authors discuss the evidence base that is currently available and plans that are in place to strengthen this.

AB  - The impact of intrafamilial, relational trauma on the development of children is severe and pervasive, affecting all aspects of the child's functioning. The psychological treatment of children who have experienced such trauma may well have the greatest impact in facilitating their development when it adopts a relational approach incorporating central features of attachment theory while also including their caregivers when they are able to provide safety. Dyadic developmental psychotherapy (DDP), an attachment-focused family therapy, has two phases. In the first, the therapist sees the caregivers alone to ensure that they have the motivation and ability to relate with the child in ways that facilitate attachment security. This stage includes a description of the process of the treatment and the caregivers' central role in the co-regulation of emotional states, reducing the impact of the trauma on the child, assisting the child in turning to them for comfort and safety, and assisting in the development of new meanings of the trauma itself and its effect on the child's future. During the joint sessions, the therapist, utilising an intersubjective stance, actively facilitates a dialogue between therapist, child, and caregiver that incorporates the goals mentioned above and, within an open-and-engaged conversational tone, helps the child to develop a coherent autobiographical narrative that is not fragmented by terror and shame.

AB  - Two disorders of attachment have been consistently identified in some young children following severe deprivation in early life: reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder. However, less is known about whether signs of these disorders persist into adolescence. We examined signs of reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder at age 12 years in 111 children who were abandoned at or shortly after birth and subsequently randomized to care as usual or to high-quality foster care, as well as in 50 comparison children who were never institutionalized. Consistent with expectations, those who experienced institutional care in early life had more signs of reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder at age 12 years than children never institutionalized. In addition, using a conservative intent-to-treat approach, those children randomized to foster care had significantly fewer signs of reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder than those randomized to care as usual. Analyses within the ever institutionalized group revealed no effects of the age of placement into foster care, but number of caregiving disruptions experienced and the percentage of the child’s life spent in institutional care were significant predictors of signs of attachment disorders assessed in early adolescence. These findings indicate that adverse caregiving environments in early life have enduring effects on signs of attachment disorders, and provide further evidence that high-quality caregiving interventions are associated with reductions in both reactive attachment disorder and disinhibited social engagement disorder.

AB  - As foster and kinship carers are central to the lives of looked after children, it is important to recognise their unmet needs and the impact of these on the caring task. This article explores these issues by applying a hierarchy of needs to the foster and kinship care context, drawing on the perspectives of those involved. A group of Australian foster carers (n = 52) and kinship carers (n = 16) were interviewed using the CUES-C, a 13-item questionnaire that collects both qualitative and quantitative responses with regard to carers' perceived needs and satisfaction. Thematic analysis was undertaken and participant responses were coded and organised according to the updated hierarchy of human motives proposed by Kenrick and colleagues (2010), based on Maslow's (1943) widely used hierarchy of needs. The findings support Lyubomirsky and Boehm's (2010) conclusion that parenting may interfere with the capacity to meet our other human needs and so has significant implications for the form of intensive parenting practised by foster and kinship carers. It was found that without the provision of timely and holistic supports and intervention, the two-way relationship between the needs of looked after children and their carers may create a feedback loop where stress and trauma can be endlessly amplified, to the detriment of both parties. The evidence highlights the importance of addressing both the needs of carers and those of the young people they look after, and suggests some basic improvements that could ease the burden of care and simultaneously increase satisfaction in the caring role.

AB  - Growing numbers of children in the UK enter the care system with significant emotional and behavioural problems. The recent increase in numbers of children and the reduction in residential children's homes have contributed to a growth in foster carer provision. As a result, carers are looking after more vulnerable children. Challenging child behaviours and carers' lack of skill in dealing with them are the two most common reasons for placement breakdown and foster carers need comprehensive support and additional training to avoid this happening. This article describes carer-specific issues discussed during group leader supervision during a small platform trial of the Incredible Years (IY) parent programme delivered to foster carers in three local authorities in Wales (Bywater et al, 2010). The positive trial results, which are summarised, included reductions in children's challenging behaviour and carer depression. Issues related to the specific challenges of looking after a fostered child, which were discussed by leaders in preparing for groups and raised by the carers attending, were explored and are presented here. The beneficial effects of the programme on child behaviour and carer mental health, coupled with carer and leader feedback, confirmed the relevance and effectiveness of the IY parent programme for dedicated foster carer groups.

AB  - AbstractFoster children exhibit high rates of atypical neuroendocrine functioning compared to children in the general population. In particular, alterations in the daytime diurnal activity of the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal (HPA) axis have been observed in foster children, often characterized by blunted salivary cortisol levels (i.e., low morning levels that remain low throughout the day). There is emerging evidence that therapeutic interventions for foster children can affect this pattern of HPA axis activity, but the specific intervention components responsible for change have not been fully explicated. Within a randomized trial to evaluate a therapeutic intervention for foster preschoolers (n= 57 intervention condition; n= 60 comparison condition; n= 60 community comparison condition), the present study examined whether diurnal cortisol activity was associated with caregiver self-reported stress in response to child problem behavior. Results showed immediate reductions in caregiver stress that were sustained through 12 months postbaseline in the intervention condition. In contrast, caregivers in the regular foster care condition showed higher rates of stress across time and increased stress sensitivity to child problem behaviors. In addition, among caregivers in regular foster care, higher self-reported stress was associated with lower morning cortisol levels and more blunted diurnal cortisol activity. These results provide evidence that interventions can simultaneously impact caregiver stress and buffer children from the negative impacts of caregiver stress on HPA axis regulation.

AB  - Toddlers in child welfare often have a dysregulated stress response. We tested whether toddlers with caregivers randomized to a 10-week attachment-based intervention, Promoting First Relationships (PFR; J.F. Kelly, D. Sandoval, T.G. Zuckerman, & K. Buehlman, 2008) would show postintervention change in stimulated salivary cortisol patterns during a research home visit involving a separation–reunion procedure, as compared to a condition including child development and resource advice, but no attachment strategies. At baseline and postintervention, toddlers with a caregiver change within 7 weeks of enrollment (n = 48, age 10–25 months) provided four saliva samples during a 1½ hr research visit, and samples the next morning. The categorical dependent variable was the pattern of cortisol activity during the course of the postintervention research visit: flat, decreasing, or increasing. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test for postintervention group differences in cortisol patterns, controlling for time of day, child’s age, morning cortisol level, and baseline cortisol pattern. At baseline and postintervention, 92% of children demonstrated atypically low morning cortisol (<.21 ig/dL); postintervention, flat, decreasing, and increasing patterns were exhibited by 70, 15, and 15% of the sample, respectively. Significantly more children in the PFR condition showed an increasing pattern. This may signal an intervention effect on separation-based stress response physiology.

AB  - Discusses the important clinical issue of working therapeutically with severely disorganized, extremely dependent parents of seriously disturbed young children. The rationale presented identifies the parental disorganization and distorted relationship with their own child as a residue of early developmental conflicts for the parent. Parenthood reactivates these unmastered issues which then hinder the parents from responding to their child in ways other than in terms of their own unmet needs. Many parents demonstrate the lack of mastery of the task of separation-individuation from their own parents. Additionally, play as a mode of mastery and exploration had not been a reward for them as children. These issues contributed to disturbance of nurturance and attachment that fostered feelings of poor self-esteem and being uncared for by others. Clinical vignettes of types of disorganizing family life patterns are presented, and the types of interventions found to be most successful are described. Findings indicate that severely disorganized families require assistance in learning new organizing and managerial roles and that practicing such roles enables parents to observe directly the positive effects on family relationships. Such observations positively reward continuing efforts to change and permit parents to feel more competent and less at the mercy of their children and life events.

AB  - Maltreated youths in foster care often experience negative developmental and psychological outcomes, which have been linked with poor response inhibition. Recent evidence suggests that childhood maltreatment is also associated with alterations in the neural circuitry underlying response inhibition. However, a burgeoning line of research has begun to explore the mitigating effects of preventive interventions on neural functioning. The current study used event‐related functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the impact of early childhood maltreatment and a preventive intervention on response inhibition in early adolescence. Thirty‐six demographically similar adolescents (ages 9–14 years) completed a Go/NoGo task. The sample included nonmaltreated adolescents (n = 14) and maltreated adolescents who were in foster care as preschoolers and randomly assigned to receive services as usual (n = 11) or a preventive intervention, Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers (n = 11). The groups demonstrated similar behavioral performance but significantly different neural patterns. The maltreated adolescents who received services as usual demonstrated subcortical hypoactivity during successful response inhibition and subcortical hyperactivity during unsuccessful response inhibition. In contrast, the nonmaltreated adolescents and maltreated adolescents who received the intervention exhibited strikingly similar neural patterns during successful response inhibition, but the maltreated adolescents who received the intervention demonstrated prefrontal hypoactivity during unsuccessful response inhibition. These findings offer preliminary evidence that early childhood maltreatment alters the neural patterns underlying response inhibition in early adolescence and that participating in a preventive intervention could mitigate maltreatment‐related effects on these neural systems.

AB  - Background: The familial context is assumed to significantly influence the development of child emotion regulation (ER). Placement in a foster family has a significant impact on the child’s familial context. Besides, foster children with a history of maltreatment or neglect are at a greater risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems. In this study, we investigated the influence of selected variables of the familial context on ER in young children of two samples. Objective: How is parenting behavior related to children’s ER and how are both factors related to child emotional and behavior problems? Method: The primary caregiver of 99 children, growing up in their biological family, and 51 foster children, who were placed in a foster family during the previous 24 months, reported on their own parenting behavior as well as their (foster) child’s ER and mental health. Results: While the parenting behavior significantly predicted adaptive (but not maladaptive) ER strategies in biological families, we found no significant influence in foster families. However, we found maladaptive ER strategies were significant predictors of child adjustment in both samples. Conclusion: The reason why the influence of the familial context on child ER is higher in biological families might be due to confounding genetic effects or to the fact that biological parents already had more time to exert their influence. Especially with regard to the foster families, the results provide important information for future interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) Theoretischer Hintergrund: Es wird angenommen, dass der familiäre Kontext einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Entwicklung der kindlichen Emotionsregulation hat. Bei Pflegekindern wird durch die Fremdplatzierung entscheidend Einfluss auf den familiären Kontext genommen. Pflegekinder mit Misshandlungs- oder Vernachlässigungserfahrungen haben außerdem ein erhöhtes Risiko emotionale und Verhaltensauffälligkeiten zu entwickeln. In dieser Studie wird der Einfluss ausgewählter Variablen des familiären Kontextes auf die Emotionsregulation junger Kinder in zwei Stichproben untersucht. Fragestellung: Wie hängt das elterliche Erziehungsverhalten mit der kindlichen Emotionsregulation und beides wiederum mit kindlichen emotionalen und Verhaltensauffälligkeiten zusammen? Methode: Die primären Bezugspersonen von 99 Kindern, die in ihrer Herkunftsfamilie aufwachsen, und 51 Pflegekindern, die in den letzten 24 Monaten in einer Pflegefamilie untergebracht wurden, berichteten über das eigene Erziehungsverhalten, die kindliche Emotionsregulation sowie psychische Auffälligkeiten ihres (Pflege‐)Kindes im Alter von 2;0 bis 7;11 Jahren. Ergebnisse: Während das Erziehungsverhalten bei den Herkunftsfamilien signifikant die Nutzung adaptiver (nicht aber maladaptiver) Emotionsregulationsstrategien vorhersagte, ergaben sich bei den Pflegefamilien diesbezüglich keine signifikanten Zusammenhänge. Der signifikante Einfluss maladaptiver Emotionsregulationsstrategien auf psychische Auffälligkeiten fand sich in beiden Stichproben. Schlussfolgerungen: Dass der Einfluss des familiären Kontexts auf die Emotionsregulation in den Herkunftsfamilien größer ist als in den Pflegefamilien, könnte auf mögliche konfundierende genetische Effekte oder darauf zurückzuführen sein, dass die Einflussmöglichkeiten der Herkunftsfamilien-Eltern bereits über längere Zeiträume bestanden. Insbesondere bezogen auf die Pflegefamilien bieten die Ergebnisse verschiedene Ansatzpunkte für Interventionen. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Effective service interventions greatly enhance the well-being of foster youth. A study of 262 foster youth examined one such intervention, therapeutic mentoring. Results showed that mentored youth improved significantly in the areas of family and social functioning, school behavior, and recreational activities, as well as in the reduction of expressed symptoms of traumatic stress. Study results suggest that therapeutic mentoring shows promise for enhancing treatment interventions. (Contains 4 tables.)

AB  - The present researcher examined the relationship between foster parent acceptance and psychological adjustment with foster children's treatment attendance and adjustment. Deriving from the parenting literature and parental acceptance-rejection theory, which maintains that parenting practices influence children's social and psychological development, parental acceptance-rejection was expected to predict children's treatment attendance and behavioral and emotional adjustment. Parent psychological adjustment was hypothesized to moderate the impact of parental acceptance on treatment attendance and on child adjustment. The sample consisted of 113 foster parents who brought their foster children weekly to outpatient clinics in New York City. Foster parents completed the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire, the Personality Assessment Questionnaire, and the Child Behavioral Checklist. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that treatment attendance was predicted by parental acceptance-rejection and that child adjustment was predicted by parental acceptance-rejection. Rejecting foster parents were significantly less likely to bring their foster children to treatment sessions than foster parents who were more accepting of their foster children. Rejecting foster parents also tended to report having foster children who were more poorly behaviorally and emotionally maladjusted than foster parents who were more accepting of their foster children. Foster parent emotional adjustment had a moderating effect on child internalizing behaviors but failed to have a moderating impact on externalizing behaviors. The findings of the present study support previous researchers who demonstrated associations between parenting style and children's social and behavioral problems. A limitation of the present study, which should be addressed by future researchers, is the restricted method of measuring parental acceptance-rejection. Future investigators may add to the literature by exploring the extent to which failures in daily parenting strategies may interact with parental acceptance-rejection to influence children's developmental outcomes.

AB  - Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC) has been shown to be an evidence based alternative to residential rearing and an effective method to improve behavior and attachment of foster children in the US. This preliminary study investigated an application of MTFC for preschoolers (MTFC-P) in the Netherlands focusing on behavioral outcomes in course of the intervention. To examine the following hypothesis: 'the time in the MTFC-P intervention predicts a decline in problem behavior ', as this is the desired outcome for children assigned to MTFCP, we assessed the daily occurrence of 38 problem behaviors via telephone interviews. Repeated measures revealed significant reduced problem behavior in course of the program. MTFC-P promises to be a treatment model suitable for high-risk foster children, that is transferable across centers and countries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background: Among children placed out of home, behavioral and relationship functioning is often problematic. When placed in foster care, problems tend to persist or even worsen and increase the risk of placement breakdown. Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers is an intensive behavior-focused program for young foster children (3 to 7 years) aiming to provide children with a positive and stimulating foster family setting and individually tailored behavioral interventions. This study will be the first to examine the effectiveness of Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers outside the US and to examine the effectiveness across a broader range of problems related to foster care. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial, wherein we expect to include 80 child-foster carer dyads. Forty dyads will be assigned to Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care for Preschoolers and 40 to treatment as usual, following pre-randomization. Data to be gathered concern problem behavior, symptoms of attachment disorder, post-traumatic stress symptoms, quality of life, hypothalamic-adrenal-pituitary axis functioning, parental stress and autonomic reactivity, to be collected via questionnaires, observations, interviews, saliva and recording at six time-points over 24 months. To compare treatment outcomes, Fisher's exact tests and repeated measures (mixed models) and independent t-tests will be used. All analyses will be performed following the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: Examining the generalizability of previous findings in the US and extending these previous findings is a step towards improving knowledge about treatment of young foster children with severe behavioral, emotional and attachment problems.

AB  - Results from adoption studies suggest that adoptive families may experience special impediments with respect to the developmental progress and outcome of their children. Based on attachment theory, 2 early intervention programs (IPs) were designed to support families in the Netherlands with an internationally adopted child. The IPs aimed at promoting maternal sensitive responsiveness, secure infant–mother attachment relationships, and infant exploratory competence. 90 families with an interracially adopted infant (71 from Sri Lanka and 19 from Korea) were assigned to either a control group or one of 2 IP groups. The 1st IP group (N = 30) received a personal book , which focused on sensitive parenting. The 2nd IP group (N = 30) was provided with the same book and 3 video-feedback sessions at their home. The control group (N = 30) received no IP. In the control group sensitive responsiveness and security of attachment were comparable to outcomes from normative samples. The personal book IP did not bring about change in mothers or infants. However, intervention effects were established upon maternal sensitive responsiveness, infant competence, and infant–mother attachment in the book and video IP group.

AB  - Background: As infant disorganized attachment is a serious risk factor for later child psychopathology, it is important to examine whether attachment disorganization can be prevented or reduced. Method: In a randomized intervention study involving 130 families with 6-month-old adopted infants, two attachment-based intervention programs were tested. In the first program, mothers were provided a personal book, and in the second program mothers received the same personal book and three home-based sessions of video feedback. The third group did not receive intervention (control group). Results: The intervention with video feedback and the personal book resulted in enhanced maternal sensitive responsiveness (d = .65). Children of mothers who received this intervention were less likely to be classified as disorganized attached at the age of 12 months (d = .46), and received lower scores on the rating scale for disorganization than children in the control group (d = .62). In the book-only intervention group children showed lower disorganization ratings compared to the control group, but no effect on the number of infants with disorganized attachment classifications was found. Conclusion: Our short-term preventive intervention program with video feedback and a book lowered the rate of disorganized attachment. The effectiveness of our intervention documents the importance of parenting in the development of infant attachment disorganization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Promoting Positive Parenting: An Attachment-Based Intervention illuminates the successful implementations of one of the few evidence-based parenting intervention programs. More than 20 years ago the editors began experimenting with videotaping parental behavior in order to enhance parents' sensitivity to their children's signals. This new book presents the outcome of this effort. Videofeedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting (VIPP) is a brief and focused parenting intervention program that has been successful in a variety of clinical and non-clinical groups and cultures. The book opens with an introduction to the VIPP program and the theoretical background of this parenting intervention, followed by a narrative and metaanalytical review of the attachment-based interventions. The book continues with detailed descriptions and case reports of several intervention studies of the program. It describes the implementation and testing of a variety of VIPP based interventions highlighting different families in a variety of childcare settings, and in various countries including the Netherlands, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Chapters present how the VIPP approach was implemented in samples of insecure mothers, mothers with eating disorders, preterm infants, adopted children, and children with early behavior problems. Relevant for researchers, practitioners, and advanced students in developmental and clinical psychology, human development and family studies, psychiatry, social work, public health and nursing, early childhood education, and related fields, the book may also be used in advanced courses on early childhood development and attachment and on (preventive) early-childhood interventions.

AB  - This chapter describes the effects of two intervention programs designed to enhance adoptive parents' sensitivity and to promote secure infant-parent attachment relationships. In our prospective, longitudinal intervention study, positive short-term effects of our attachment-based video-feedback intervention were found on maternal sensitivity and insecure-disorganized infant attachment in adoptive families with and without birth children. In sum, our video-feedback intervention showed important positive short-term effects on the adoptive parent-child relationship and (in one sub sample) positive long-term effects on adopted children's development and adjustment. Based on our intervention, a new post adoption service with video feedback was started in practice, meant for all new adoptive families. Our outcomes suggest that adoptive parents can be supported to adequately fulfill the tasks of parenting. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD), based on attachment theory and social learning theory, is an intervention aimed at enhancing sensitivity and firm limit setting in parents, and reducing behavior problems in children. The VIPP-SD program has been tested in populations of vulnerable children and parents at risk in twelve randomized controlled trials, and shows significant effects on both positive parenting and child outcomes. Here, we present a case study of an adoptive mother and her two-and-a-half-year-old adopted daughter. During the VIPP-SD program, including one introduction visit and six intervention sessions with video feedback, the mother–child interaction revealed important changes in positive parenting and child outcomes. By describing the intervention process in some detail we hope to shed light on how the VIPP-SD program can be used by clinicians and practitioners who support families in need of parenting support.

AB  - Worldwide, over 2 million children reside in institutional care; while family care is ideal, institutions will continue to exist for many years, and it is important to investigate ways to improve the care of children who reside in institutions. The current study is a post-adoption follow-up of an intervention in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation Baby Homes (BHs) wherein children received enhanced social-emotional care by regular BH caregivers. Children in this study previously resided in a St. Petersburg BH and received either No Intervention (CNoI), Training Only (TO), or Training and Structural Changes (T+SC). While children were in the institution, there were clear differences between groups in their physical, behavioral, and socialemotional development with T+SC faring the best, TO intermediate, and NoI having the poorest outcomes (St. Petersburg-USA Orphanage Research Team, 2008). This dissertation aimed to determine whether benefits of the intervention persisted up to 8 years after adoption. Parents completed measures including the 23-item Attachment Questionnaire, Indiscriminately Friendly Behavior Measure, BRIEF-P, CBQ (selected subtests), ITSEA, and CBCL 1&frac12;-5. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine the effect of Age at Adoption, Years in Adoptive Home, Intervention Group, and Age at Adoption x Intervention Group interactions on each outcome measure. Overall, while there are some residual effects of the intervention on children after adoption, graduates of each intervention group are functioning very well in early childhood. Graduates of intervention BHs tend to have better attachment security, lower levels of indiscriminately friendly behavior (T+SC only), fewer behavior problems (T+SC only), and lower levels of Internalizing problems (TO only) and Dysregulation (TO only) than CNoI. An older age at adoption or more time in the adoptive home were associated poorer outcomes in some domains. Children who had more exposure to intervention conditions (e.g., T+SC and TO adopted at older ages) had better attachment security (T+SC) fewer externalizing (TO only) and internalizing (TO only) problems, but poorer executive function and lower competence. Because all groups were, on average, functioning within the normal range of behavior, 'poorer' outcomes are hypothesized to reflect the increased agency, creativity, and emotional expression of children from intervention BHs.

AB  - This study is a post-adoption follow-up of social–emotional interventions in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation Baby Homes (BHs). Children previously resided in BHs and received Care as Usual (CAU, N = 220), Training Only (TO, N = 94), or Training plus Structural Changes (T + SC, N = 45). This study examined intervention effects 0–6.5 years post-adoption to the United States, at age 9 months to 7 years old. Adoptive parents completed questionnaires on their child's social and behavioral development. Intervention graduates had better attachment security, less indiscriminate friendliness, and fewer behavior problems than CAU graduates. Children who had longer exposure to intervention conditions had better attachment security, but poorer executive function, externalizing and internalizing problems, and competence. Thus, although postinstitutionalized children were generally functioning in the normal range in early childhood and effect sizes were small, a social–emotional intervention in institutions is associated with modest benefits to attachment and behavior problems and apparent decrements to executive function.

AB  - Context: Child maltreatment is a significant risk factor for adult mental disorders and physical illnesses. Although the child welfare system routinely places severely abused and/or neglected children in foster care, no controlled studies exist to determine the effectiveness of this intervention in improving the long-term health of maltreated youth. Objective: To present results of the first quasi experimental study, to our knowledge, to evaluate the effects of expanded foster care treatment on the mental and physical health of adult foster care alumni. Design: We used a quasi-experimental design to compare adult outcomes of alumni of a model private foster care program and 2 public programs. The latter alumni were eligible for but not selected by the private program because of limited openings. Propensity score weights based on intake records were adjusted for preplacement between-sample differences. Personal interviews administered 1 to 13 years after leaving foster care assessed the mental and physical health of alumni. Setting/Participants: A representative sample of 479 adult foster care alumni who were placed in foster care as adolescents (14-18 years of age) between January 1, 1989, and September 30, 1998, in private (n = 111) or public (n = 368) foster care programs in Oregon and Washington. More than 80% of alumni were traced, and 92.2% of those traced were interviewed. Intervention: Caseworkers in the model program had higher levels of education and salaries, lower caseloads, and access to a wider range of ancillary services (eg, mental health counseling, tutoring, and summer camps) than caseworkers in the public programs. Youth in the model program were in foster care more than 2 years longer than those in the public programs. Results: Private program alumni had significantly fewer mental disorders (major depression, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders), ulcers, and cardiometabolic disorders, but more respiratory disorders, than did public program alumni. Conclusion: Public sector investment in higher-quality foster care services could substantially improve the long term mental and physical health of foster care alumni.

AB  - Abstract: This study was conducted to examine the impact of Relationship Focused Intervention (RFI) on a sample of Korean mothers and their preschool-aged children with disabilities. Subjects were 18 mothers of children with developmental problems (ages 3–8 years). Ten of these mothers were assigned to an RFI Treatment group and eight to a No RFI Control group. The RFI was adopted from the Family/Child Curriculum (Mahoney, G. (1999; Family/Child Curriculum: A relationship focused approach to parent education/early intervention. Tallmadge, OH: Family Child Learning Center). This intervention focused on teaching mothers to use responsive interactive strategies through a process of modeling, coaching, role-playing and video feedback. It was implemented with parents during weekly group and individual intervention sessions that were conducted over three months period. Comparison of pre- and post-intervention assessments of parent–child interaction indicated that RFI was effective at encouraging parents to become more responsive, affective and achievement oriented with their children. These changes in mothers’ interactional style were associated with an 18% increase in children''s interactive behaviors. Regression analyses indicated that increases in children''s behavior were associated positively with maternal responsiveness and negatively with maternal achievement orientation. Results from this study are discussed in terms of (a) implementing RFI with Korean mothers and (b) the mechanisms by which RFI promotes children''s development.

AB  - Research examining the role families play in children's education has investigated a variety of activities or methods through which parents participate in learning. These programs are typically characterized as "parent involvement models," which are defined as the participation of significant caregivers (including parents, grandparents, stepparents, foster parents, etc.) in activities promoting the educational process of their children in order to promote their academic and social well-being (Fishel & Ramirez, 2005). "Family-school partnerships" are distinct from parent involvement models. The authors define family-school partnerships as child-focused approaches wherein families and professionals cooperate, coordinate, and collaborate to enhance opportunities and success for children and adolescents across social, emotional, behavioral, and academic domains (Albright & Weissberg, 2010; Downer & Myers, 2010; Lines, Miller, & Arthur-Stanley, 2010). Despite general support for parent involvement, some large scale reviews have indicated little to no effect on student achievement or parent or teacher behavior, student grades, or educational outcomes for students with and without disabilities. Previous research has failed to operationalize the variables of interest, or failed to differentiate between general "parent involvement" models (focusing on "structural" activities that parents implement) and "family-school partnership" models (focusing on "relationships" between family members and school personnel for supporting children's learning and development). A review of "family-school partnerships" apart from parent involvement may uncover distinct contributions of approaches that promote joint parent-teacher relationships and cross-system supports for broad student outcomes, and operative intervention components (structural and relational) that influence outcomes. The present study is an extension of a previously reported (Sheridan et al., 2011) investigation of two distinct intervention approaches--i.e., those that are relational in nature and strive to strengthen family-school partnerships and those that are structural in nature and attempt to promote parent involvement activities. The following are the research questions: (1) To what degree do family intervention studies espouse involvement versus partnership approaches?; (2) Which structural and relational components are most prevalent in involvement and partnership interventions?; (3) What outcomes are most commonly assessed in parent involvement and partnership interventions?; (4) What sample and setting characteristics are most prevalent in the literatures on parent involvement and family-school partnership interventions?; and (5) What methodological features characterize the literature? The coding scheme is appended. (Contains 6 figures and 2 tables.) [This paper was presented originally by the authors at the 2012 annual meeting of the National Association of School Psychologists.]

AB  - Substance use problems are highly prevalent among youth in foster care. Such problems in adolescence have long-lasting implications for subsequent adjustment throughout adulthood and even across generations. Although several programs have demonstrated positive results in reducing substance use in at-risk youth, few studies have systemically examined how such programs work for foster youth and whether they are effective for both genders. This study examined the efficacy of KEEP SAFE, a family-based and skill-focused program designed to prevent substance use and other related health risking behaviors among youth in foster care. We hypothesized that improving the caregiver-youth relationship would lead to later reductions in youths' involvement with deviant peers, which subsequently would lead to less substance use, and that this mechanism would work comparably for both genders. A sample of 259 youth (154 girls, ages 11-17 years) in foster care and their caregivers participated in a randomized controlled trial and was followed for 18 months post-baseline. Results indicated that the intervention significantly reduced substance use in foster youth at 18 months post-baseline and that the intervention influenced substance use through two processes: youths' improved quality of relationships with caregivers at 6 months post-baseline and fewer associations with deviant peers at 12 months post-baseline. This suggests that these two processes may be fruitful immediate targets in substance use prevention programs for foster youth. We also found little gender differences in direct and mediating effects of the intervention, suggesting KEEP SAFE may be effective for both genders in foster care.

AB  - The effects of child maltreatment on children's chronic health conditions have become more visible during recent years. This is true for mental health problems as well as some chronic physical conditions, both summarized as new morbidity within pediatrics. As several Bradford Hill criteria (criteria from epidemiology for the determination of the causal nature of a statistical association) are met, the likely causal nature of underlying associations is discussed. Early family support may have the potential to modify such associations, although empirical evidence is lacking. At least for attachment-based interventions with foster carerers after child maltreatment, positive effects on child HPA axis dysregulation have been demonstrated.

AB  - The current chapter focuses on the impact of family structure, functioning, culture, and family-based interventions on children's health. There are many different types of family structures worldwide that can have differing impacts on children's health and well-being. In Western and Eastern cultures, children have been raised primarily by two biological parents with large extended families and communities. In other cultures, parents might not be the primary caretakers or advisors, and that role is assumed by a grandparent, aunt, or uncle. The head of the household or who has the most power also varies greatly—the mother, the grandmother, the father, the grandfather, or another family member. The relationship between lack of positive parental involvement and negative outcomes in children and adolescents is well established. This relationship is not absolute; however, evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions should be disseminated widely to reduce health-care and social costs by helping parents or caregivers improve their parenting effectiveness, reunify children in foster care with their families, or help absent parents to reconnect with their children. Parent training opportunities in effective parent and family skills training programs should be disseminated widely at low or no cost to help mothers and fathers to feel more confident and competent in their parenting ability. In the end, it is the functioning and not the structure of the family that matters most. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Young children who enter the foster care system may have an increased risk emotional, behavioral, and developmental disorders when compared to the general population (Leslie, Landsverk, Ezzet-Lofstrom, Tschann, Slymen & Garland, 2000). This dissertation documents the process of planning and conducting a program evaluation of a university-based counseling program that provides therapeutic services for children in the foster care system. The Foster Care program addresses the psychological and social problems of being involved in the foster care system through therapy and consultation. The program evaluation that was planned and conducted used Maher's (2012) program planning and evaluation framework. The first research task was the creation of a Program Design document. This document put the program into an evaluable format using Maher's model (2012). The second research task was to determine the extent in which the program was being implemented as designed. Data were collected through interviews with stakeholders, survey responses of graduate student therapists, and a review of program related documents. The intent of the Program Design Document and evaluation of program implementation was to determine strengths of the program and make recommendations to key stakeholders involved in the Foster Care program. Recommendations were offered about the development, improvement and ongoing evaluation of the Foster Care program. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research on stress‐sensitive biological systems has typically focused on activation at one time, yet recent theories emphasize dynamic, context‐specific adaptation. This study tested hypothesized calibration of one such system by examining both mean levels and longitudinal stability of daily cortisol—reflecting hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis activation—in children exposed to high‐risk versus lower‐risk caregiving contexts. Context‐specific effects of longitudinal cortisol profiles were addressed via relations with child psychiatric symptoms. Children from regular foster care, foster children participating in a family‐based intervention, and community comparison children (n = 96 total) collected saliva samples for cortisol assay at 29 timepoints across 6 + years. High‐risk (regular foster care) children showed lower and more variable cortisol levels than their lower‐risk (treatment foster care, community comparison) counterparts. For the high‐risk children only, higher and more stable cortisol related to elevated anxiety symptoms. Implications for contextual calibration of stress systems and family intervention mechanisms are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Objective: This study examined risk of placement disruption and negative placement outcomes (e.g., residential treatment and incarceration) among adolescents placed in traditional family foster care for a year or longer. A foster parent's report of externalizing behavior problems was expected to be a stronger predictor of disruption and negative outcomes than a caseworker's report. Additionally, the association between behavior problems and placement disruption was expected to be mediated by the youth's degree of belonging and integration in the foster home. Method: The caseworkers and foster parents of 179 randomly selected 12-13-year-old adolescents placed in traditional foster care were interviewed by telephone. Interviews included standardized measures of externalizing behavioral problems and several other variables that have been previously associated with placement movement. Disruption from the youth's foster home at the time of the interview was prospectively tracked for 5 years. Results: Over half of the youth experienced a disruption of their placement. Contrary to expectations, behavior problems as reported by caseworkers, but not foster parents, were predictive of placement disruption. However, the foster parent's report of behavior problems predicted risk of negative outcome after a period of 5 years. As hypothesized, integration in the foster home was highly predictive of placement stability and mediated the association between behavior problems and risk of disruption. Conclusions: Results suggest that integration in the foster home might be an important dimension of placement adaptation that should be considered during service planning for foster youth in long-term foster care. In addition, using standardized measures of behavior with both foster parents and caseworkers might be necessary to assess both long-term risk of negative outcomes and more immediate risk of placement disruption.

AB  - Abstract: The development of effective interventions for foster children with behavior problems is essential given the consequences of behavior problems for children''s placement stability and permanency outcomes. This article presents findings from a pilot study of an intervention providing parent management training (PMT) and support to foster parents in groups and home visits. The intervention was an adaptation of the KEEP (Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported) group intervention, provided in a large urban child welfare agency serving predominantly African American foster parents. The study used an intent-to-treat design, with 25 foster parents of 31 children (ages 4–12) in specialized foster care assigned to either an intervention or treatment as usual control group. Longitudinal outcomes were analyzed using random effect regression models. Over time, children''s behavior problems were significantly lower in the intervention group relative to the control group, and the effect of the intervention was partially mediated by parents'' understanding of how to appropriately use the intervention parenting skills. These results provide support for the effectiveness of KEEP with urban foster children with significant behavior problems.

AB  - The theory of ambiguous loss is useful in understanding the experiences and challenges of the foster care system. Its indications are illustrated with foster children's perceptions and stories. These include semi-structured interviews with 23 foster children aged 7 to 12 years, and stories provided by 182 foster children, aged 2 years to 10, to the Blacky Pictures. The pervasive presence of ambiguous loss in the stories of these foster children illustrates that many behavioral indicators of cognitive and emotional discomfort in foster children are normative and that our interventions with them and their institutionalized caretakers could be effectively guided by this knowledge.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) in Chinese children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD features. Methods: This study adopted a randomized controlled trial design without blinding. Participants were randomized into either the intervention group (n = 32) and offered PCIT by trained PCIT practitioners or the waitlist control group (n = 32) and offered PCIT after the intervention group had completed treatment. Parent participants were requested to complete questionnaires on their children’s behavior and their parental stress. PCIT practitioners observed parent–child interactions according to a coding system. Results: Analysis was by intention to treat. The results indicated a significant decrease in child behavior and attention problems, parental stress, and negative parenting practices and an increase in positive parenting practices in the intervention group at postintervention (p ≤ .002 in all cases). Conclusion: This study provided promising evidence on the effectiveness of PCIT in Chinese children with ADHD or ADHD features.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the efficacy of Hands-On Parent Empowerment-20 (HOPE-20) program. Methods: Eligible participants were parents residing in Hong Kong with target children aged 2 years attending nursery schools. Cluster randomized control trial was adopted, with 10 schools (110 participants) assigned to intervention group and 8 schools (63 participants) to control group using random number table, without blinding of participants. Intervention group attended 20 parent training sessions based on social learning theory. Children were individually assessed on preschool concepts and language skills. Parents completed child behavior and parental stress questionnaires. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis (173 participants and 18 schools) indicated improvement in primary outcomes: child preschool concepts (d = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.38, 1.01]) and child behavior problems (d = 0.67, 95% CI: [0.35, 0.99]), together with language skills (d = 0.98, 95% CI: [0.65, 1.30]), and parental stress (d = 0.71, 95% CI: [0.39, 1.02]). Conclusions: The results suggested that HOPE-20 program was beneficial to Chinese families.

AB  - Recently, the systematic skills approach has been applied to the training of foster parents. A systematic skills training program for foster mothers was evaluated to investigate the relationship between skills training and the outcome of the placement for the child. The sample consisted of inner-city, lower socio-economic minority foster mothers and their foster children. The 10-week training program was eclectic and emphasized personal development as a prerequisite for skill development. The foster children of a group of foster mothers (N=8) trained in the program were compared with those of a no-contact control group (N=6) before and after training with regard to self-esteem, asocialization, emotionality-tension, self-exploration and placement stability. Dependent measures included self-report paper-and-pencil tests, foster parent ratings, independent judge's ratings of videotaped parent-child interactions and objective determination of placement continuation. Children of training group foster mothers improved significantly more than control children on emotionality-tension, but not on other measures. The findings suggest that future research should examine the effects of an extended training program. (Author/NRB)

AB  - Young children who experience early adversity are at risk for problems regulating emotions, behavior, and physiology, which in turn place them at risk for later psychopathology, school problems, and peer relation difficulties. Therefore, early parenting interventions are critical in helping this vulnerable population develop adequate self-regulatory capabilities. Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) is an intervention developed to help parents learn to behave in ways that enhance young children's self-regulatory capabilities. In the present study, we found that preschool-aged foster children who had received the ABC intervention showed stronger cognitive flexibility and theory of mind skills, relative to foster children who had received a control intervention. Foster children who had received the ABC intervention showed capabilities in these areas that were not significantly different from a comparison group of children who were never in foster care. These findings are promising in suggesting that the ABC intervention enhances the development of foster children's self-regulatory capabilities.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 2-component intervention for biological and foster parent (pairs) to improve parenting practices, co-parenting, and child externalizing problems. Participants were biological and foster parents (N = 128) of primarily neglected children (ages 3 to 10 years) placed in regular foster homes. Biological and foster parents were randomly assigned in pairs to the intervention (n = 80) or a usual care (n = 48) condition. Intervention families received a 12-week parenting course (Incredible Years) and a newly developed co-parenting component. Key findings included significant gains in positive parenting and collaborative co-parenting for both biological and foster parents at the end of the intervention. At follow-up, intervention parents sustained greater improvement in positive parenting, showed gains in clear expectations, and reported a trend for fewer child externalizing problems. Findings supported the feasibility of offering joint parenting training to meet the needs of participating families and demonstrated that the co-parenting construct applied to families in the foster care system was amenable to intervention.

AB  - Young children in foster care often experience adversity, such as maltreatment and lack of stability in early caregiving relationships. As a result, these children are at risk for a range of problems, including deficits in executive functioning. The Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up for Toddlers (ABC-T) intervention was designed to help foster parents behave in ways that promote the development of young children’s emerging self-regulatory capabilities. Participants included 173 parent–toddler dyads in three groups: foster families that were randomly assigned to receive either the ABC-T intervention (n = 63) or a control intervention (n = 58), as well as low-risk parent–toddler dyads from intact families (n = 52). At a follow-up conducted when children were approximately 48 months old, children’s executive functioning abilities were assessed with the attention problems scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) and a graded version of the Dimensional Change Card Sort developed for preschoolers (Beck, Schaefer, Pang, & Carlson, 2011). Results showed that foster children whose parents received the ABC-T intervention and low-risk children never placed in foster care had fewer parent-reported attention problems and demonstrated greater cognitive flexibility during the Dimensional Change Card Sort than foster children whose parents received the control intervention. These results indicate that an attachment-based intervention implemented among toddlers in foster care is effective in enhancing children’s executive functioning capabilities.

AB  - The article focuses on the methodology and concepts of family treatment to the foster care situation to see whether this approach might not be more effective than the traditional individual approach. Sessions are used that include both the foster family and the foster child to help them with the many problems they face in living together. The aim is to adapt family focused treatment techniques to the purposes of foster family placement. The family-focused approach offers distinct advantages. Through the use of family sessions, all members of the foster family are involved more actively in the treatment program. Their intimate involvement increases their sense of fulfilling the foster family role, and each family member is helped to recognize the importance of his particular contribution to the success of the child's placement. The family session also gives the caseworker an opportunity to observe directly the interaction between the members of the foster family and the foster child and thus to get a more accurate picture and deeper understanding of the relationships between them. The family session has the additional advantage of minimizing the clients' concern about the worker's reactions.

AB  - Each year over 20,000 youth age out of the child welfare system without reaching a permanent placement in a family. Certain children, such as those spending extended time in foster care, with a diagnosed disability, or adolescents, are at the highest risk for aging out. As young adults, this population is at and increased risk of incarceration; food, housing, and income insecurity; unemployment; educational deficits; receipt of public assistance; and mental health disorders. We reviewed the literature on foster care legislation, permanency, outcomes, and interventions. The outcomes of children who age out of the child welfare system are poor. Interventions to increase permanency include training programs for youth and foster parents, age extension for foster care and insurance coverage, an adoption tax credit, and specialized services and programs that support youth preparing for their transition to adulthood. Future ideas include expanding mentoring, educational support, mental health services, and post-permanency services to foster stability in foster care placements and encourage permanency planning. Children in the child welfare system are at a high risk for physical, mental, and emotional health problems that can lead to placement instability and create barriers to achieving permanency. Failure to reach the permanency of a family leads to poor outcomes, which have negative effects on the individual and society. Supporting youth in foster care throughout transitions may mediate the negative outcomes that have historically followed placement in out-of-home care.

AB  - Relationship education researchers have recommended that dissemination efforts be expanded so interventions can reach high-risk groups. Electronic delivery can help achieve this goal, yet its development has been modest. In this pilot study, foster and adoptive parents, a high-risk group, were randomized to a brief, Web-based Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program adaptation (PREP) or to a control intervention on birth parent visitations. PREP participants strongly agreed, on average, that course content was realistic, helpful, and useful. They also improved significantly more than did control couples on PREP skill knowledge and reported use. Both groups improved similarly on more general communication-based outcomes.

AB  - Currently in the United States, one in 10 children suffers from a mental illness that is severe enough to cause some level of impairment (National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH], 2007). One group of adolescents that is at a much higher risk for mental illness are those in foster care, as it is estimated that 40 to 85% suffer from a mental illness (Austin, 2004). Adolescents in foster care are more at risk for attachment difficulties due to their histories of trauma and displacements from their home, and may be more at risk for problem behaviors related to insecure attachment (Austin, 2004). To ensure that these adolescents get the help they need to prevent ongoing mental health issues as adults, it is important to be able to accurately assess their treatment needs and identify specific areas where they are exhibiting problem behavior. The current study utilized an existing database of adolescents ages 12 to 18 from an outpatient mental health clinic to examine changes in functioning over the course of one year in treatment. Scores on the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS) were used to measure treatment outcome, with lower scores indicating lower levels of impairment. For each case in the sample, three CAFAS scores were compared: the initial CAFAS score recorded at the start of treatment, the CAFAS score recorded at six months of treatment, and the CAFAS score recorded at 12 months of treatment. The sample size was 98, with approximately 50% in foster care and 50% not in foster care. Overall, results showed that both males and females not in foster care demonstrated a continued decrease in scores over the three time periods, indicating that level of impairment decreased over the course of treatment. The males in foster care also demonstrated a continued decrease in scores over the course of treatment. However, the females in foster care did not demonstrate a decrease in scores, and their CAFAS score at 12 months of treatment was the same as their initial CAFAS score, indicating no change in impairment level. Potential reasons for these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many young people in care have experienced trauma. The emotional and behavioural issues that often ensue, along with foster carers' varying levels of confidence and skills, are cited as the main reasons for placement disruption. Placement breakdown can represent a further trauma for young people and is also highly costly for local authorities. The need for interventions to develop foster carers' competence and confidence in understanding and managing foster children's behaviour is therefore significant. The Solihull Approach (SA) promotes the parent and child relationship by emphasising the need for emotional containment and a reciprocal relationship so as to form a framework for thinking about, understanding and effectively managing behaviour. The 'Solihull Approach course for foster carers: understanding your foster child's behaviour' is a 12-week programme tailored to the demands of this task. It has been run within the Springfield Project in Fife, Scotland for the past four years. In the reported study 83 participants completed evaluation forms. A thematic analysis of their replies revealed that the most important things learned were: taking a step back; understanding the effects of trauma; reciprocity; communication and play; containment (of my child); understanding my child; and the ability to offload when full up. The course helped participants to better understand their foster child by clarifying the nature of the relationship and their role, understanding the impact of the child's early experiences and appreciating that she or he is not to blame. Participants took from the course: increased understanding; being part of the group; staying calm and thinking before they act; feeling more confident; and looking after themselves and seeking containment. Pre- and post-Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) questionnaires were collected from 34 carers with children in the six to 18 age group and 13 looking after children aged one-and-a-half to five years. Paired samples t-tests revealed no statistically significant difference in pre- and post-scores in either the six- to 18-year-olds (t(33)=1.6, p=0.114) or the one-and-a-half- to five-year-olds (t(12)=2, p=0.069). Possible reasons for this and its implications are explored. However, the identified qualitative themes suggest that the aims of the training are being met. There was a strong overall sense that foster carers found the course helpful and informative, suggesting that it could represent a valuable intervention for promoting placement security.

AB  - This study examined whether or not Theraplay (Theraplay is the registered trademark of the Theraplay Institute, Wilmette, IL) increased attachment with 5 year old previously institutionalized (PI) twins. In addition, it reviewed whether or not Theraplay decreased problem behaviors in these twins. PI twins adopted from an Eastern European orphanage at the age of 3 years and 9 months underwent pretreatment and posttreatment testing which included: Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report Form, Attachment Story Completion Task (a measure of internalized representations), Marschak Interaction Method (an interactional assessment measure used with parents and child), and the Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire. Additionally, Cermack's Developmental and Sensory Processing Questionnaire was used to screen for sensory processing difficulties pretreatment. The test data showed that the twins attachment increased, and their problem behaviors decreased after they received the Theraplay treatment. While Theraplay needs further study, the findings of this study suggest that Theraplay, a short term attachment based play therapy, can be an effective intervention with PI children who need to strengthen their attachment relationships.

AB  - This book vividly shows how creative arts and play therapy can promote children's recovery from experiences of disrupted or insecure attachment. Leading practitioners explore the impact of early relationship difficulties on children's emotions and behavior. Replete with in-depth case material, the volume brings to life a range of therapeutic approaches that utilize art, music, movement and dance, drama, creative writing, and play. Clinicians are given indispensable tools for helping children process painful emotions and memories and rebuild the capacity to form trusting attachment bonds. Introductory chapters integrate research in creative arts and play therapy with cutting-edge knowledge about attachment, trauma, and neuroscience. The value of creative expression and sensory-based experiences for treating attachment difficulties is emphasized. Part II presents a range of therapeutic approaches in rich clinical detail. Featured are ways to work with children of different ages—particularly those who are coping with multiple traumatic events or losses—as well as their caregivers. Expert contributors explain how their respective therapies address attachment issues; offer clear descriptions of their techniques and materials; and illustrate what each intervention looks like in action. Rounding out the volume. Part III discusses applications for specific populations, including complex trauma survivors, children experiencing traumatic grief, those in foster care, cross-cultural adoptees, and children displaced by homelessness or natural disasters. Providing fresh ideas that can expand the toolbox of any child clinician, this book will be read with interest by clinical psychologists; arts, play, and other creative arts therapists; child psychiatrists; social workers; and counselors, as well as graduate students.

AB  - Ben Holmes and Miriam Silver report on a group intervention that combined aspects of established parenting groups with attachment theory, developed to help adoptive parents and foster carers understand and manage their child's behaviour. Participants were provided with an understanding of the principles of attachment theory, how this related to their child's development and behaviour, and how they could improve the relationship with their child through greater empathy and the provision of a safe, structured home environment. Analysis of pre-and post-questionnaire measures indicated significant improvements in the parent--child relationship. Additionally, parent/carer observations indicated a reduction in the perceived severity and impact of the problems or concerns about their child's behaviour.

AB  - Children and youth in long-term foster care are subjected to multiple losses in their lives, repeated placement failures, and lack a sense of belonging to any family, school, or community. These losses, and resulting grief, have predisposed these children to depression and other mental illnesses, difficulty establishing relationships, and trusting others. The current research lacks support for treatment that is specific to this population, addresses the grief experienced by a foster child, or substantially aids in improving placement stability to reduce any further loss. This study examined three treatment models, the 3-5-7 model©, CBT, and treatment as usual, to determine which model demonstrated a reduction in depressive symptoms, as well as improved self-concept, relationships, and placement stability. The results of this study demonstrated that participants in the 3-5-7 model © group had a statistically significant reduction in trust and a slight improvement in depression. Those children who had depression scale scores in the clinical range at pre-treatment, remained in the clinical range at post-treatment for all three groups.The results of the current study failed to demonstrate that CBT or TAU resulted in a significant decrease in depression. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding improvement in self-concept or relationships. The 3-5-7 model© group did not have any placement changes during the study while CBT and TAU did, however the results were not significant. The CBT group demonstrated more than double the amount of drop-outs compared to the other two groups. There were several limitations to this study including a small sample size, and lack of detailed information regarding psychotropic medication. Further research is needed to determine whether the 3-5-7 model© with the addition of a SUDS scale, or coping skills component can demonstrate increased efficacy or with foster children titrated off of medication.

AB  - On any given day, more than half a million youth reside in foster care within the United States (Bruskas, 2008; Child Welfare League of America, 2006). Prior to placement, many of these youth have experienced prolonged and substantiated maltreatment such as abuse and neglect, (Levitt, 2009, Sprang, Clark, Kaak, & Brenzel, 2004), which may predispose them to various mental health issues that warrant mental health care (Landsverk, Burns, Stambaugh, & Reutz, 2009). These mental health needs, which far exceed those of their same aged counterparts not residing in foster care, however, may not being adequately addressed by our child welfare or mental health system (Levitt, 2009). Additionally, research suggests that few foster parents receive appropriate and sufficient training to deal with the specific emotional and behavioral problems of the children placed in their care, resulting in lowered foster parent satisfaction levels and multiple failed placements (Barth, Green, Webb, Wall, Gibbons, & Craig, 2008; Chamberlain, Price, Reid, & Landsverk, 2008; Redding, Fried, & Britner, 2000). Based on the literature, it is this author's belief, that one specific mental health concern of youth in foster care is self-injurious behaviors. This belief is based on research, which identifies common environmental and individual risk factors amongst both individuals who engage in acts of self-injury and youth placed in foster care (Claes, Vandereycken & Vertommen, 2004; Gratz, 2006; Strong, 1998; Suyemoto & MacDonald, 1995, van der Kolk, Perry & Herman, 1991; van der Kolk, McFarlane & Weisaeth, 1996; & Walsh, 2006). Although a paucity of research exists on the exact prevalence rates of self-injurious behavior amongst the foster care population, literature which indicates the need for foster parents to receive increased training on the potential various mental health issues of youth in care is overwhelming. The present work consists of a psycho-educational training program designed to be implemented by certified foster parent trainers and administered to licensed foster parents. This six-hour training was developed from an integration of the research on effective treatments for self-injurious behaviors amongst adolescents, as well as the literature examining the unique mental health needs of youth placed in foster care. The training program utilizes a multi-modal format including case vignettes, role plays, questionnaires, and group activities in conjunction with lecture, to help foster parents become familiar with the current research on self-injurious behaviors and the special risk factors of the youth placed in their home. The training also includes strategies that foster parents can utilize to effectively parent a youth who self-injures, which include communication skills, a suicide assessment protocol, information on how to navigate the mental health system, and resources for support. The implications and limitations of this training, as well as areas of future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Research into the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions for older children who have experienced multiple forms of trauma within the context of their early development is scant. This article explores the effectiveness of Neuro-Physiological Psychotherapy (NPP): a wrap-around multi-disciplinary, neuro-sequential, attachment-focussed intervention for children and families who present with multiple, clinically significant, emotional and behavioural difficulties. In total, 31 young people and their adoptive parents took part in the study. Baseline measures were repeated and parents and children interviewed. An assessment of the parent/child relationship and child attachment was undertaken but not analysed for this article. Analysis of the repeated measures received statistically significant changes in behavioural regulation, metacognitive executive functioning and externalising and internalising difficulties, alongside an improvement in thought and social problems. An analysis of the parent interviews provided positive results in terms of the children’s engagement in education, an absence of further mental health diagnosis or involvement in the criminal justice system. Further hypotheses are posited regarding the impact of the treatment and further research into the effectiveness of the model outlined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Little evidence exists regarding outcomes of therapeutic interventions for maltreated children who are removed from their birth families and then adopted. This study follows on from a previous evaluation of the Neuro-Physiological Psychotherapy (NPP) model, which found significant, positive and sustained post-treatment change. To compare the outcomes for the NPP intervention group to those of a control group. Participants were families who received the NPP intervention and families who, following assessment, did not receive the NPP intervention as recommended. Groups were matched in terms of demographics and presentation at assessment. A comparison of outcomes took place using ANCOVA. Significant differences were found between group measures of Behavioral Regulation Index (moderate effect size, Cohen's d =.435; F(1, 1505) = 14.476, p =.000) and Global Executive Functioning (BRIEF) (small effect size, Cohen's d =.147; F(1, 3506) = 7.771, p =.008); mental health difficulties common in maltreated children (ACC/ACA) (small effect size, Cohen's D =.212; F(1, 1100) = 6.197, p =.020) and externalizing behavior (CBCL) (small effect size, Cohen's D =.025; F(1, 686) = 5.420, p =.025). A comparison of parent responses on quantitative aspects of a structured interview using chi-square analysis revealed significant differences between the groups on relationship quality (x2 (2, N = 53) = 10.453, p =.005 with a medium effect size, Cramer's V =.444), disruption (x2 (1, N = 54) = 4.998, p =.025. The effect size was medium with Cramer's V =.304), parental separation rates (x2 (1, N = 45) = 9.474, p =.002. The effect size was moderate with Cramer's V =.459) and several indicators for longer-term social inclusion. The results are discussed in the light of the model's neurodevelopmental and sequential approach, which focuses on sensory integration, affect regulation and therapeutic life story work alongside parent and school support. Implications regarding current treatment guidelines for this population are discussed; and a call is made for interventions which actively consider and address the neurodevelopmental impact of maltreatment.

AB  - The phenomenon of adopted children following an accelerated developmental 'catch up' period during the first twenty-four months following placement in an adoptive home has been well established. This study examined the effect of early intervention services on specific and global developmental domains. It was hypothesized that children participating in rehabilitation services will attain greater recovery than children receiving no additional services. A sample of convenience of 81 children adopted from Russia, Ukraine, China, Kazakhstan, and Georgia was collected. Children's ages ranged from 6 months through 38 months at time of adoption. Children were residing in their new adoptive homes for a minimum of 10 months Adoptive families were recruited from adoption support groups and referrals. A parental questionnaire, the Denver Prescreening Developmental Questionnaire II, and the Brigance Preschool Screen were mailed and completed by adoptive parents. A MANOVA was conducted to examine the effect of the rehabilitation engagement variables. Results were non significant, F (1, 79) + 1.46, p = <.20. The data was skewed and highly variable with majority of children receiving no interventions. A hierarchical regression analysis examined the relationship between the time spent in country, age, and their interaction on scores on the Brigance. Results were significant, R square = .24, F (1, 79) = 24.39, p < .001, indicating 'time in the country' was a greater predictor of scores on the Brigance, accounting for 24% of the variance. The results of age was non-significant, R square = .01, p = .74. The interaction however, between time in country and age was significant, R square change = .05, F (1, 77) = 5.47, p = .02, although an inverse relationship, indicating as the child's age increases by month, their score decreased by 5%. An analysis to determine is a curvilinear relationship existed between age and scores on the Denver. Results were non-significant suggesting a lack of sensitivity in identifying delays across age for this population. Analyses examining the curvilinear relationship between both age and time in country on the Brigance were both significant. The results for age, F (4, 74) = 4.50, p = .006; results for time in country, F = (3,73) = 10.84, p < .001;F. Surprising was the lack of early intervention services sought out by adoptive parents, as well as the extended accelerated recovery period beyond twenty-four months.

AB  - Background: Children reared in institutions experience elevated rates of psychiatric disorders. Inability to form a secure attachment relationship to a primary caregiver is posited to be a central mechanism in this association. We determined whether the ameliorative effect of a foster care (FC) intervention on internalizing disorders in previously institutionalized children was explained by the development of secure attachment among children placed in FC. Second we evaluated the role of lack of attachment in an institutionalized sample on the etiology of internalizing disorders within the context of a randomized trial. Methods: A sample of 136 children (aged 6-30 months) residing in institutions was recruited in Bucharest, Romania. Children were randomized to FC ( n = 68) or to care as usual (CAU; n = 68). Foster parents were recruited, trained, and overseen by the investigative team. Attachment security at 42 months was assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, and internalizing disorders at 54 months were assessed using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment. Results: Girls in FC had fewer internalizing disorders than girls in CAU (OR = 0.17, p = .006). The intervention had no effect on internalizing disorders in boys (OR = 0.47, p = .150). At 42 months, girls in FC were more likely to have secure attachment than girls in CAU (OR = 12.5, p < .001), but no difference was observed in boys (OR = 2.0, p = .205). Greater attachment security predicted lower rates of internalizing disorders in both sexes. Development of attachment security fully mediated intervention effects on internalizing disorders in girls. Conclusion: Placement into FC facilitated the development of secure attachment and prevented the onset of internalizing disorders in institutionalized girls. The differential effects of FC on attachment security in boys and girls explained gender differences in the intervention effects on psychopathology. Findings provide evidence for the critical role of disrupted attachment in the etiology of internalizing disorders in children exposed to institutionalization.

AB  - Several issues surrounding adoption are addressed in this journal. "Openness in Adoption," by Ruth G. McRoy and others, explores the movement away from confidentiality in adoption. "Mid-Life Reflections on Adoption" by Carol Yttri and "An Adoption Journey" by Shannon Latimer detail the experiences of adults who were adopted as children. In "Emotional Disorders in Adopted Children and Youth" (Ruth G. McRoy and Harold D. Grotevant), a research review finds that adopted children are referred for psychological treatment two to five times as frequently as their nonadopted peers. A study of 50 adopted and 50 non-adopted adolescents in residential treatment centers indicated that adoption outcomes are influenced by a variety of child and parental factors, including the parent's reasons and motivation for adoption and their attitudes toward adoptive parenthood. "Intercultural Adoption" (Joan D. Ramos), "The Case Against Transracial Adoption" (Leora Neal), and "The Birth of Intercountry Adoptions" (Susan Soon Keum Cox) discuss the impact of adoptions between members of racial, ethnic, national origin, and religious groups on the children and families involved. "The Multiethnic Placement Act" by Carol Williams reviews this 1994 law. "Parent and Child Attachment" (Margaret Redfern) examines the bonding between parents and their children. "Adoption Subsides: A Boon for Children" (Ann Sullivan) discusses the federal adoption subsidy. "My Family: Formed by Adoption" (Stephanie Ward) is a personal narrative by a woman who adopted a child with mental disorders. Selected adoption resources are also listed. (CR)

AB  - Over a half-million children are currently in the foster care system within the United States (http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/factsheets/foster.pdf#page=1 ). Foster children are more likely to have a trauma history due to the factors that led to their involvement with the foster care system (Pinderhughes, Jones-Harden & Guyer, 2007). A foster child's trauma exposure can be complicated and multifaceted, and often includes neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse and/or multiple placements in the homes of caregivers. Foster parents are required to undergo training mandated by their state of residence. Though these programs provide sufficient training they often fail to address the effects of trauma and the subsequent behaviors manifested. Additionally, the state-mandated training programs are lengthy and costly for those not mandated by the state. The goal of this project was to create a free of charge, on-line training model that adds to the existing training models as well as provides additional trauma-specific information to foster parents. Furthermore, the intent was to create a training model that specifically addressed the symptom expression of physically abused children and interventions that could be utilized to ameliorate or manage these behaviors. The training model was posted on-line and was accessible to anyone with access to a computer and the Internet. The on-line training model was reviewed by a panel of 10 masters' and doctoral-level mental health clinicians. A 17-item questionnaire was provided to the reviewers, and they were asked to rate items on a 5-point Likert scale. On average, the reviewers gave positive ratings, which indicated their overall satisfaction with the on-line training model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Staff of residential treatment centers in Texas and Minnesota identified institutionalized children who had been adopted before the age of 2 and nonadopted children who were between the ages of 11 and 18. The availability sample of adopted children included 26 males and 24 females ranging in age from 11 to 17. The second availability sample (the control sample) consisted of 50 nonadopted adolescents in residential treatment and their families. Instruments were the parent interview, the child interview, the caseworker interview, the Quality-of-Marriage Index, and symptom identification. Issues examined from the data are factors predating the child's birth or adoption, the early adaptation of the child within the family, family relationships and their contexts, and peer relations. Information is also provided on the clinical issues involved in the study, including data on symptoms, diagnoses, prognosis, and treatment history of the children in the study. Three chapters address the adoption issues encountered by the children in the adoptive sample and in the Minnesota sample. Conclusions highlight theoretical and practice issues. 32 tables, 1 figure.

AB  - Our community psychology clinic offers psychotherapeutic services to address the effects of complex trauma on children, youth, and their caregiving systems. We offer individual, group, and family therapy, psychological assessment, collateral support, case management, and coordination of care with other providers. We have programs for transitional age youth and a specialized mental health screening for all foster children in our county catchment area. These services are delivered in our clinic offices or in the client's school, residence, or other community locations. The program utilizes principles derived from child and adolescent development (particularly attachment theory), relational and systems theories, multicultural approaches, community psychology, and complex trauma frameworks. Our goal is to help children develop ways of coping with the impact of the maltreatment they have suffered and promote a more resilient developmental trajectory and to assist their connections with caregivers, teachers, and social supports and networks.

AB  - Objective: Research indicates that foster parents often do not receive sufficient training and support to help them meet the demands of caring for foster children with emotional and behavioral disturbances. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) is a clinically efficacious intervention for child externalizing problems, and it also has been shown to mitigate parenting stress and enhance parenting attitudes and behaviors. However, PCIT is seldom available to foster families, and it rarely has been tested under intervention conditions that are generalizable to community-based child welfare service contexts. To address this gap, PCIT was adapted and implemented in a field experiment using 2 novel approaches—group-based training and telephone consultation—both of which have the potential to be integrated into usual care. Method: This study analyzes 129 foster-parent-child dyads who were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) waitlist control, (b) brief PCIT, and (c) extended PCIT. Self-report and observational data were gathered at multiple time points up to 14 weeks post baseline. Results: Findings from mixed-model, repeated measures analyses indicated that the brief and extended PCIT interventions were associated with a significant decrease in self-reported parenting stress. Results from mixed-effects generalized linear models showed that the interventions also led to significant improvements in observed indicators of positive and negative parenting. The brief course of PCIT was as efficacious as the extended PCIT intervention. Conclusions: The findings suggest that usual training and support services can be improved upon by introducing foster parents to experiential, interactive PCIT training.

AB  - Objective: This study presents outcomes from a randomized trial of a novel Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) model for foster families. Differential effects of two intervention doses on child externalizing and internalizing symptoms are examined. Method: A sample of 102 foster children was assigned to one of three conditions—brief PCIT, extended PCIT, or wait-list control. The brief and extended groups received 2 days of PCIT training and 8 weeks of telephone consultation. The extended PCIT group received an additional booster training plus 6 more weeks of consultation. Wait-list controls received services as usual. Tests of change over time were estimated using mixed-model repeated measures analysis of covariance. Results: Compared to controls, children in both PCIT groups exhibited a greater reduction in externalizing and internalizing scores over time. Pairwise contrasts of the two PCIT conditions yielded mixed results. Conclusion: Results indicate that PCIT can be tailored efficaciously for foster families using alternative treatment modalities.

AB  - Objective Foster caregivers are tasked with developing good relationships with children and managing child behavior; however, these caregivers often do not have access to evidence-based interventions typically designed for custodial parents and children with behavioral and/or traumatic symptoms in the clinical range. This study examined the feasibility and impact of a novel six-hour training, Child Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE), on caregiver behavior compared to standard training used by foster care agencies. Method Thirty-one foster caregivers (90% female) were randomly assigned to CARE training (n = 15) or standard training (n = 16). Results In comparison to the standard training, foster caregivers who received CARE training demonstrated significant improvement in parenting behavior as measured by the Dyadic Parent Child Interactive Coding System one month later and reported fewer anxiety symptoms in their children as measured by the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children three months later. Conclusions These preliminary findings from this randomized controlled trial suggest that CARE can be delivered in the context of existing mandated foster care training programs, with some evidence that CARE training enhances positive parenting behavior and assists with decreasing anxiety symptoms in youth in the foster care system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions that promote positive mother-infant interactions may reduce the risk of poor developmental outcomes for the child. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of infant communication education presented prenatally to first-time mothers on the quality of interaction that occurs between the mother-infant dyad in the first 24 hours following birth. METHOD: Twenty-nine first-time mothers were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. The intervention group received education on infant behaviors, states, and communication cues. A specific mother-infant interaction was videotaped and scored using the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS). The scores between groups were compared to determine the effect of education on the interaction that occurred between the dyads. RESULTS: Significant intervention effect was found in the overall totals (t(27)= 1.69; p = .05) as well as the contingency scores related to sensitivity to cues (t(27)= 1.93; p = .05) and social-emotional growth-fostering behaviors (t(27)= 1.93; p = .05). CONCLUSION: A videotaped educational intervention on infant communication implemented prenatally resulted in significant differences between the intervention and control groups on NCATS scores (totals, sensitivity to cues, and social-emotional growth-fostering behaviors). The use of videotaped educational information facilitates very early mother-infant interaction.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the efficacy of psychological therapies for children in foster care with emotional and behavioural difficulties. Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) focuses on supporting the carer-child relationship by promoting reflective capacity. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of an RCT of MBT, delivered in a family-format, for children who are in foster care in the UK. Method: Herts and Minds was a phase II, blinded feasibility RCT with follow-up of at 12 and 24 weeks post-randomisation. Participants were children (age 5–16) in foster care referred to a targeted mental health service, who had some level of difficulty as identified by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Aims were to assess: the feasibility of recruitment processes and study uptake; capacity to train mental health practitioners to deliver MBT to an acceptable level of treatment integrity; establish acceptability and credibility of MBT as an intervention for children in foster care; establish feasibility and acceptability to participants of conducting an RCT; and estimate the likely treatment efficacy effect size. Participants were randomly allocated to either MBT (n = 15) or Usual Clinical Care (UCC) (n = 21) individually or in sibling groups. A range of qualitative and quantitative data was gathered to assess feasibility. Results: Feasibility was established with regard to: capacity to recruit participants to a study; capacity to train mental health practitioners to deliver MBT to an acceptable level of treatment integrity; acceptability and credibility of MBT; and feasibility and acceptability to participants of conducting an RCT. A number of issues made it difficult to estimate a likely treatment efficacy effect size. Conclusion: With modifications, it is feasible to run an RCT of MBT for children in foster care. Both the therapy and research design were acceptable to participants, but modifications may be needed regarding both the timing of assessments and the identification of appropriate primary outcome measures. Given the lack of evidenced based therapies for this population, such a trial would be a significant contribution to the field. Findings may be useful for other groups planning clinical trials of psychological therapies for children in foster care. Trial registration: ISRCTN 90349442. The trial was retrospectively registered on 6 May 2016.

AB  - It is clear that children experiencing placement instability in foster care and during reunification face a higher likelihood of future maladjustment; however, the risks associated with placement instability are not well understood. This is especially true for young children in foster care. The current study uses a sub-sample of existing data from the Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care Preschool (MTFC-P) treatment outcome study. The sample consists of 78 pre-school age foster children randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: MTFC-P foster care or regular foster care (RFC). Among the variables significantly correlated with regular foster care placement instability were number of days in care, age at first foster care placement, number of incidents of maltreatment, and suspected or confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure. At study start, children having more pre-study regular foster care related placement instability were significantly more likely to display emotional and behavioral difficulties, display behavioral problems rated as more stressful by foster parents, and exhibit greater developmental delay. Children in the MTFC-P treatment condition experienced significantly fewer placement disruptions than children in the RFC treatment as usual control condition. Children with greater than average number of pre-study transitions who were placed in the MTFC-P treatment condition were more likely than their RFC counterparts to experience a successful permanent placement within 12 months. Children suspected or confirmed of prenatal drug exposure were significantly more likely to experience a successful biological parent reunification when placed in MTFC-P, than when placed in the RFC treatment as usual control condition. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for child welfare policy, foster care interventions, and future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the impact of training foster carers on children's emotional and behavioural functioning.Methods: In a randomised controlled trial in 17 Scottish local council areas, with immediate and nine month follow up, 182 children and their foster families were randomly allocated to either standard services alone or standard services plus extra training for foster carers on communication and attachment. Main outcome measures were child psychopathology, attachment disorder, self esteem, and cost of foster care.Results: Over 60% of children had measurable psychopathology at baseline. The training was perceived as beneficial by participants. Scores for parent reported psychopathology and attachment disorders decreased by around 5%, self esteem increased by 2%, and costs by 22% in the intervention group. Results were non-significant.Conclusions: Despite being well received by foster carers, the training was not sufficient to make a useful impact on the high level of psychopathology. This group may warrant more intensive interventions.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that 'co-parenting', the extent to which parents function as partners or adversaries in their parenting roles, makes an independent contribution to child adjustment, beyond the influence of parenting alone (Cowan & McHale, 1996). This study is the first of its kind to extend the investigation of co-parenting to foster-care. Two measures of co-parenting in foster care were developed, a coding scheme for observations (Foster Care & Co-parenting Rating System; FCCRS) and a questionnaire (Co-parenting Events Scale; CES), to study the impact of co-parenting in foster care on behavior outcomes. Participants were 24 biological and foster parents and their 3 to 10 year old foster child (M = 6.9 years: SD = 2.6). Most families (over 90%) fell below the midpoint on the FCCRS supportive (M = 9.2, SD = 2.1) and unsupportive subscales (M = 6.6, SD = 1.5). Although a strong relationship was not found between FCCRS scales and child behavior, medium to large relationships were found for the CES. A significant large inverse effect was found for biological parents on CES and externalizing behavior problems, r = -.89, p = 02; large negative effects were also found for internalizing and total behavior problems, although not significant, r = -.59, p = .22 and r = -.69, p = .13, respectively. For foster parents, only a large negative effect was found between CES and internalizing behavior problems, r = -.68, p = .14. Social competence was only positively related to FCCRS supportive co-parenting, r = .40, p = .05, and inversely related to FCCRS unsupportive co-parenting, r = -.25, p = .25. Findings on the CES, though, should be interpreted with caution (n = 6) and need replication. Co-parenting patterns were subsequently more fully examined through exploratory analyses. Findings support the application of two new co-parenting measures in foster care and underscore the need for further research into the relationships between biological and foster families and child outcomes. The unique focus on the co-parenting relationship in foster care underscores important targets for intervention and prevention and emphasizes the need for services that are multimodal and designed to address child, family (foster and biological) and social factors.

AB  - Background: The Fostering Changes programme was developed by the Adoption and Fostering National Team at the Maudsley Hospital, South London, in conjunction with King's College London. It is a 12-week group-based training programme for foster and kin carers, which aims to build positive relationships between carers and children, encourage positive child behaviour and set appropriate limits, through a practical skills-based approach. The programme also aims to improve foster carers' understanding of the causes of children's social and emotional difficulties and their confidence in applying this knowledge in various situations.Methods: This is a pragmatic open-label individually randomised controlled trial, with embedded process evaluation. A total of 237 participants will be recruited from Welsh Local Authorities and Independent Fostering Providers; those allocated to the intervention group will be offered enrolment in the next Fostering Changes programme group at their site. Participants in the control group will be offered the Fostering Changes programme at the end of the follow-up period. Data will be collected at baseline, immediately following the 12 week Fostering Changes intervention, and 12 months from the start of the Fostering Changes programme. The primary outcome measure assesses the extent to which carers feel able to cope with and make positive changes to the lives of their foster children and is measured by the Carer Efficacy Questionnaire at 12 months.Discussion: The trial will determine whether the Fostering Changes programme, in the long term, can deliver important, significant differences to the way foster carers build positive relationships with their foster children, encourage positive child behaviour and set appropriate limits, compared with usual care.Trial Registration: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number, ISRCTN19090228 .

AB  - Children who have experienced trauma or disruptions in their caregiver relationships are at great risk for developing significant emotional and behavioral problems in adolescence. Evidence related to intervention acceptance, uptake, and caregiver satisfaction of Connect for foster parents and caregivers of transgender- and gender-nonconforming youth will be presented. Preliminary findings support the effectiveness of these attachment-based interventions for foster parents and caregivers of transgender- and gender-nonconforming youth.

AB  - The experience of early abuse and neglect can predispose victims to mental health problems. Mental health awareness as an aspect of mental health literacy can prevent deterioration in mental health and promote post-abuse recovery. The lack of research on mental health awareness in carers means there is little understanding regarding the association between mental health awareness and their looked after children's emotional and mental health needs. This study examined the impact of a counselling skills intervention on foster carers' confidence in their mental health awareness and their ability to cope. This was done by enhancing communication skills. Foster carers undertook a training course in counselling skills of 30 hours duration. Data were collected before and after the course. Results indicated that foster carers believed they had a better understanding of looked after children's emotional needs and their mental health. This study highlights the need for further training for foster carers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The study is aimed to examine manifestations of the attachment disorder behaviors in children with institutional experience living in substitute families, before and after the program of psychological support, in comparison with the behavior of children in families of biological parents depending on disability status and the degree of participation of substitute families in the program. The group of children in substitute families comprised 201 people (108 typical, 93 with disabilities, the age before the program - 4-10.5 years, after 5-12 years), in biological families 125 (65 typical, 60 with disabilities, age of assessment - 4.5-13.5 years). The support program consisted of 4 stages of activities directed to promote interaction between children and substitute caregivers and attachment development in children. The Attachment Disorder Checklist was used in the longitudinal study with an interval of about 17 months to assess the negative manifestations of attachment behaviors. The results show that for groups of typical children and children with disabilities in substitute families the mean group values of the attachment behaviors' negative manifestations decrease after the support program in general and at the maximum and average, but not at the minimum degree of participation. After the program the mean group values of the negative manifestations in foster children is higher than in children in biological families, both in the group of typical children (for the total score and all areas) and children with disabilities (for the total score, in the social and emotional areas); the differences between children in substitute and biological families reduce with the increase of participation in the program. The results are discussed from the perspective of theoretical and empirical research data on effects of interaction and attachment based intervention programs on the behavior of children with institutional experience.

AB  - In this chapter, we share our experiences of working with parents and children and training clinical students, including social workers, over the past five years in a group attachment-based intervention (GABI). We designed this intervention specifically for clinical work with marginalized, socially isolated parents and their children (aged 0 to 3 years). The therapeutic goal of the intervention is to prevent child maltreatment by developing secure parent/child attachment relationships, promoting infant mental health, and reducing parental stress and social isolation. The intervention targets the needs of parents whose personal histories include multiple adverse childhood experiences including physical abuse, neglect, sexual abuse, multiple foster care placements, parental substance abuse, incarceration, and domestic and community violence. Theoretical and research findings from an attachment perspective inform the clinical model. The intervention is part of a study investigating its clinical effectiveness using state-of-the-art attachment measures, including indicators of reflective functioning. Thus, the GABI approach is an example of engaging in translational research whereby the clinical work influences the research and the research influences the clinical work. A further integral part of the intervention is to train new clinicians alongside more seasoned clinicians in how to deliver the intervention. The lead clinician (AM) holds supervision immediately after each 2-h group clinical session, three times per week. The lead researchers (MS & HS) conduct weekly university-based research discussions to review video-taped GABI sessions to further develop a clinical training manual that may serve as a basis for replication and assist in training/supervision. This chapter illustrates both these reflective activities with the aim of showing how affectively laden material, typically residing 'out of sight' and 'out of mind' can effectively become 'in sight' and 'in mind', to the benefit of all stakeholders in the process. Several examples will serve as descriptions of this process that enhances reflective capacities of clinicians and of parents involved in the intervention. This chapter highlights the use of reflective supervision in training alongside its central role in the successful delivery of GABI. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of a system-wide reform effort to implement trauma-informed care (Trauma Systems Therapy [TST]) across a large, private child welfare system. The longitudinal associations among implementation of TST and four measures of children's well-being (functioning, emotional regulation, and behavioral regulation) and placement stability were examined. A description of the implementation of TST can be found in a separate article in this issue. Latent growth curve models were estimated using child-level administrative data on children's well-being, placement stability, and exposure to TST dosage for 1499 children in out-of-home placements. Results indicate that, as children's care teams implement TST, children demonstrate greater improvements in functioning, emotional regulation, and behavioral regulation and they experience increased placement stability. Moreover, results demonstrate that positive effects of implementation of TST are produced by both those who work closely with the child (caregivers, case managers, and therapists) and those who work more distally with the child (case manager supervisors and family service coordinators), suggesting that no one staff member or caregiver is central to providing trauma-informed care; rather it may be the confluence of the TST skills of the child's entire care team that produces better outcomes.

AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the effects of attachment therapy on the reduction of aggressive behaviors on the special needs adopted population. The study design was a prospective, pre post, quasi-experimental controlled study. The subjects were recruited through the Attachment Center at Evergreen, Colorado. Eligible subjects included children between the ages of 4 and 14 years, adopted children having lived in the present adopted home for at least one year. Parents contacted the Attachment Center between 1996 and 1997 concerned about their child's aggression and lack of attachment towards the parent, and all subjects undergoing attachment treatment returned home at the completion of treatment. Wilcoxon's signed rank tests for paired data were used to examine possible changes in aggression and delinquency in the treated subjects. Both the aggressive and delinquent items had significantly decreased for the treatment group at the time 2 measure, respectively (p = 0.02, p = 0.006). There was no significant change in the comparison group at time 2. The Wilcoxon's ranks sum test was used to compare groups on the changes in aggression and delinquency. Findings resulted in significant differences for delinquent scores over time and approaching significance for aggression scores, with the median decrease being more substantial in the treatment group (p = 0.07, aggression, p = 0.05, delinquency). Finally, relationships and correlations among all the variables were assessed. The results show that in the treated children there was a median decrease of 9.5 in the aggression scores and a median decrease of 5.0 in the delinquency scores. Also, there is evidence to show that there is a significantly larger decrease in the treatment group than in the comparison group on aggression (decrease of 9.5 in treatment group versus decrease of 4.0 in the comparison group) and on delinquency (decrease of 5.0 in the treatment group versus decrease of 1.0 in the comparison group). Aggression and delinquency scores were found to be highly, positively correlated. No significant relationships were found among the demographic variables and the changes in aggression and delinquency. Explanations for these findings are discussed along with suggestions for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The present randomized controlled trial examined the four months follow-up effectiveness of Parent Management Training Oregon (PMTO) for parents with foster children (aged 4–12) with severe externalizing behavior problems in long-term foster care arrangements. The aim of PMTO, a relative long and intensive (6–9 months, with weekly sessions) parent management training is to reduce children's problem behavior through improvement of parenting practices. We specifically investigated whether PMTO is effective to reduce foster parenting stress. It was expected that PMTO would reduce parenting stress in foster parents, improve the quality of parenting practices, and reduce children's problem behavior. Multi-informant (foster mothers, foster fathers, and teachers) data were used from 86 families. Multilevel analyses based on the intention to treat principle (retention rate 73%) showed that PMTO, compared to care as usual, had no significant direct, nor indirect or sleeper effects at follow-up on parenting stress, parenting behavior and child behavior problems. Earlier reported immediate effects of PMTO on reduced parenting stress at posttest disappeared at follow-up. Additional analyses on the role of non-specific intervention factors in PMTO effects showed that higher therapist fidelity scores resulted in stronger effects of PMTO on parenting responsiveness, parental explaining and autonomy granting. Unexpectedly, higher fidelity scores also predicted less decrease of parenting stress at follow-up.

AB  - The present randomized controlled trial examined the effectiveness of Parent Management Training Oregon for foster parents with foster children (aged 4-12) with severe externalizing behavior problems in long-term foster care arrangements. Foster children's behavior problems are challenging for foster parents and increase the risk of placement breakdown. There is little evidence for the effectiveness of established interventions to improve child and parent functioning in foster families. The goal of Parent Management Training Oregon, a relatively long and intensive (6-9 months, with weekly sessions) parent management training, is to reduce children's problem behavior through improvement of parenting practices. We specifically investigated whether Parent Management Training Oregon is effective to reduce foster parenting stress. A significant effect of Parent Management Training Oregon, compared to Care as Usual was expected on reduced parenting stress improved parenting practices, and on reduced child behavior problems. Multi-informant (foster mothers, foster fathers, and teachers) data were used from 86 foster families (46 Parent Management Training Oregon, 40 Care as Usual) using a pre-posttest design. Multilevel analyses based on the intention to treat principle (retention rate 73 %) showed that Parent Management Training Oregon, compared to Care as Usual, reduced general levels of parenting stress as well as child related stress and parent-related stress (small to medium effect sizes). The clinical significance of this effect was, however, limited. Compared to a decrease in the Care as Usual group, Parent Management Training Oregon helped foster mothers to maintain parental warmth (small effect size). There were no other effects of Parent Management Training Oregon on self-reported parenting behaviors. Child behavior problems were reduced in both conditions, indicating no additive effects of Parent Management Training Oregon to Care as Usual on child functioning. The potential implication of reduced foster parenting stress for placement stability is discussed.

AB  - Children in foster care are susceptible to multiple placements which can result in poor attachment patterns as well as child internalizing and externalizing problems. Kinship caregivers are the federally mandated preferred placement option for children in the child welfare system. Unfortunately, these caregivers experience greater levels of stress, display lower levels of warmth, and experience increased difficulties handling child disruptive behaviors when compared to other caregivers. Child problematic behavior is one of the most prominent stressors among all foster caregivers and a leading risk factor of multiple placements. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), already established as a 'best practice' in the field of child abuse treatment, teaches parents to engage their child in nurturing and cooperative interactions and manage difficult child behaviors. One component of PCIT, Child Directed Interaction Training (CDIT), is a scientifically derived therapeutic interaction that, through behavioral principles consciously applied, changes caregiver and child behaviors, fosters changes in reciprocal emotional responses, and results in a stronger attachment relationship. Using a randomized controlled trial design, this study evaluated the efficacy of CDIT in a community center with 12 kinship caregivers and their children. Results indicated that following CDIT, kinship caregivers had less parenting stress and depression and reported a lower percentage of critical verbal disciplinary responses than wait-list control caregivers. Changes in parenting stress, depression, and critical verbal discipline practices remained stable for the CDIT group at 3-month follow-up. Kinship caregivers receiving CDIT also used significantly more positive attention skills and fewer negative leading behaviors during observed caregiver-child interactions. No attrition occurred in this study, which is uncommon for parent training interventions. The success of CDIT likely depended on the collaboration with a community resource center and community agency staff and should be considered when planning new studies. It will be important to replicate this study with a larger sample to determine the stability of these findings. CDIT holds promising evidence as a short term and cost-effective intervention for this underserved population in need of appropriate parent training in order to break the generational cycle of abuse and neglect and facilitate the growth of healthy reciprocal interactions.

AB  - In a randomized controlled trial, we compared abandoned children reared in institutions to abandoned children placed in institutions but then moved to foster care. Young children living in institutions were randomly assigned to continued institutional care or to placement in foster care, and their cognitive development was tracked through 54 months of age. The cognitive outcome of children who remained in the institution was markedly below that of never-institutionalized children and children taken out of the institution and placed into foster care. The improved cognitive outcomes we observed at 42 and 54 months were most marked for the youngest children placed in foster care. These results point to the negative sequelae of early institutionalization, suggest a possible sensitive period in cognitive development, and underscore the advantages of family placements for young abandoned children.

AB  - The effects of stress-inoculation training, assertiveness training, and empathy training on the development of resilient qualities were investigated in a sample of 82 female adolescents. Resilient qualities were identified as four levels of empathy (Fantasy, Empathic Concern, Perspective taking, and Personal Distress) as measured by the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) (Davis, 1980) and one level of separation-individuation as measured by the Healthy Separation subscale of the Separation-Individuation Test of Adolescence (SITA) (Levine, 1986). In addition, it was asserted that positive attachment experiences (Care) and negative attachment experiences (Overprotection), as measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) (Parker, Tupling, & Brown, 1979), may be related to the development of resilient qualities. Subjects were matched on family status and randomly assigned to the Training, the Placebo (Support) group, or the No-Treatment Control group. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) used to examine the effects of attachment revealed that there is a significant relationship between positive attachment experiences (Care) and the development of empathy and healthy separation, F(2.76, df = 5.00, p < .03). Findings were inclusive on the relationship between negative attachment experiences (Overprotection) and the development of empathy and healthy separation. After controlling for the effects of attachment, the effects of treatment (group) were nonsignificant, F(1.48, df = 10.00, p < .09). Univariate F-tests of between-subject effects determined that subjects differed on the Perspective Taking subscale of the IRI, indicating that positive attachment may have an impact on one level of empathy, F(=4.22, df = 2, p < .02). Post hoc tests revealed that there was a significant difference on IRI Perspective Taking between the Training and Support groups, F = 4.22, df = 2, p < .02, suggesting that a supportive group experience may be more effective in promoting one level of empathy than the use of structured, semiautomated interventions. Limitations of length of sessions, time of day, and continuity of treatment were discussed. Recommendations included incorporation of training into the school curriculum, subject participation in designing the interventions, and role play as a method to foster assertive and empathic responses.

AB  - Children in foster care have social and emotional problems at rates three to ten times higher than those found in the general population. During the elementary school years (i.e. 5-12 years), research indicates that disruptive behavior in children in care can negatively impact social, emotional and academic development, as well as placement stability. Evidenced-based interventions to improve children's behavior and reduce parenting stress are necessary. This pilot study augmented an existing evidenced-based intervention (i.e. the Incredible Years) developed for birth families for use with foster caregivers. Results from 18 families indicate that foster caregiver-reported conduct symptoms were significantly lower for children whose families participated in the treatment group. A similar trend was found for the overall externalizing behavior. No significant changes were identified in parenting attitudes and stress. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction and acceptability with the program and outcomes. These findings indicate that foster caregiver training should be examined in larger, randomized control trials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This mixed-method research aims to evaluate the life course of former children who were admitted to therapeutic foster care. The evaluation considers the histories of 58 former children fostered between 1971 and 1996, and was carried out by means of an innovative combination of tools including an open and then semi-directed interview, along with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Subjective Functional and Socio-Affective Impact {[}Retentissement Fonctionnel et Socio-affectif subject RFSJ questionnaire, and the CaMir test, a tool that emerged out of the concept of attachment. The interview is analyzed according to two methods: narrativity (Edicode) and Grounded Theory. Our preliminary results show representations of attachment comparable to those of the general population. They differ from the results found with children placed in other foster care arrangements. In addition, initial discourse analyses indicate the importance of a progress report as something that is useful, or even necessary, some years after a young adult placement.

AB  - Objective. The purpose of this study is to examine the initial clinical presentation and the response to trauma-focused, empirically-supported treatments for children in the child welfare system who have experienced multiple types of trauma experiences. Methods. Participants were 68 youths from four community agencies who were enrolled in a foster care stabilization program, were identified as having experienced either multiple or one type of interpersonal trauma experience, and were having mental health difficulties. The subjects participated in one of two trauma-focused, empirically-supported treatments and were assessed for traumatic stress symptoms, risk behaviors, overall functioning, behavioral and emotional needs, and strengths before treatment, at intervals over the course of treatment, and at treatment completion. Data collection included reports from the parent or case worker, child, and clinician. Results. Compared to children with a single type of interpersonal trauma experience, children with multiple interpersonal trauma experiences had greater and more complex Behavioral and Emotional Needs and Risk Behaviors, and fewer Strengths at baseline and showed less improvement in Behavioral and Emotional Needs, particularly symptoms of depression and problems with attachment, after a trauma-focused intervention. Children with a history of sexual abuse had lower levels of Functioning and higher severity of Risk Behaviors at baseline than non-sexually abused children. Discussion. Trauma-focused interventions were successfully implemented in a child welfare setting and were effective at reducing problems related to adjustment to trauma of several types. A history of multiple interpersonal trauma experiences had an effect on initial severity of trauma symptoms and while this group showed clinically significant improvement after trauma-focused interventions, they showed less, or slower, improvement than children with one interpersonal trauma experience.

Statistically significant improvement and large treatment effects for child behavior problems, parent–child relationship stress, and parents' empathic interactions with their children indicated the effectiveness of CPRT over treatment as usual. Findings confirm Carnes‐Holt and Bratton's ( ) results and provide strong support for CPRT as a responsive intervention for adoptive families.

AB  - Adoptive parents often struggle to understand and meet the social-emotional behavioral needs of their adopted child, particularly when the child's pre-adoption experience lacked a secure relationship with an attuned and responsive caregiver. This randomized controlled study, a replication of Carnes-Holt and Bratton's 2014 research, investigated the effects of child parent relationship therapy (CPRT) for adoptive families who reported attached-related concerns such as difficulties establishing a mutually satisfying parent-child relationship as well as concerns about the adopted child's behavior and parental stress. Participants were 49 adoptive parents (61% female; 7% couples; 86% European American, 6% Latino, 6% Asian, and 2% Black American) with adoptees between the ages of 2.5 to 9 (50% female; 35% European American, 22% Asian, 12% Latino, 10% Black American, and 21% Biracial or other). Eighty-four percent of children were adopted internationally or from the foster care system. Parents were randomly assigned to CPRT or treatment as usual (TAU). Results from 2 (group) by 2 (time) repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that compared to the TAU control group, parents who participated in CPRT reported statistically significant improvement in child behavior problems, parent-child relationship stress, and parental empathy, with a large treatment effects on all measures. Findings confirmed results from Carnes-Holt and Bratton's study and provided strong support for CPRT as a responsive intervention for adoptive parents and their children.

AB  - The attachment and biobehavioral catch-up (ABC) intervention is a targeted, short-term intervention informed by research on attachment and psychobiological regulation in early life. The intervention has been implemented with maltreated children, including children in foster families and Child Protective Services-referred families. Randomized controlled trials of the ABC intervention have indicated that it is effective in improving outcomes for children exposed to maltreatment in infancy and toddlerhood, a period of pronounced vulnerability to abuse and neglect. Specifically, vulnerable children who receive the intervention 'catch up' to their low-risk peers, demonstrating more typical cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological functioning. Improvement in parenting behaviors, the primary goal of the ABC intervention, is the likely mechanism for resilience in these children. Importantly, both immediate and longer term gains are evident among children who receive the ABC intervention. future research is needed to investigate maltreatment recidivism rates among parents who receive the ABC intervention.

AB  - The present study investigated the effectiveness of a 6-week group parent-training program with a pre-post test design using the Adult-Adolescent Parenting Inventory-2 (AAPI-2), the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5), and Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF). The training program is developmentally organized, relationship-focused, and play-based, and it targets the parent-child relationship to foster attachment and development within the child while minimizing parental stress and positively impacting parenting beliefs and attitudes within the parent. The underlying structure of the curriculum is based on the dimensions of Theraplayreg; and borrows from positive parenting concepts and strategies often observed in authoritative parenting. Ten parents fully participated, and RANOVA results indicated trends toward statistical significance on the CBCL/1.5-5 scales of Internalizing and Total Problems, and the Difficult Child scale on the PSI-SF. A qualitative analysis revealed an overall effectiveness of the program in guiding and supporting positive parenting. The quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that this group parenttraining program would be beneficial to parents of preschoolers by creating change in the child and providing the parent with guidance and support.

AB  - The present study seeks to discover what factors parents bring to adoption that help them to rise above the challenges of parenting an adopted child and find the experience rewarding. Participants included families (N=27) taking part in the UCLA TIES (Training, Intervention, Education, and Services) for Adoption program who had been tracked over a period of five years. The first domain of analyses examined whether children's lower levels of cognitive development act as a stressor that contributes to greater negative impact and lower levels of psychological well-being among adoptive parents. The second domain of analyses sought to determine how children's risk factors, including experiences of abuse and neglect, previous placements, age at adoption, and living with birth parents, ultimately impact adoptive parents in the years following placement. The third domain of analyses set out to explore child behavior problems among children adopted from foster care and how two moderators affect how parents react to child-related stressors. The final set of analyses focused on positive impact. Overall, the results of this study have shown that parents who are faced with greater child behavior problems experience more negative long-term outcomes. Additionally, parents of children who had lived with their birth mothers and those whose children were older at the time of placement reported more negative outcomes. Parenting stress and children's age at placement were most influential in determining parents' experience of positive impact. These findings may suggest that adoptive parents are challenged by their children's difficult behaviors and may also experience a sense of loss associated with missing the early years of their children's lives, a sentiment expressed by many parents during the interviews. Alternatively, children's early experiences prior to adoptive placement may result in insecure attachment that influences children's interactions with their adoptive parents, detracting from parents' experiences of positive impact and increasing negative impact. In light of the findings described above, interventions to aid adoptive parents facing difficult child behaviors may do well to focus strongly on preparation and education about the risks and realities of adoption from foster care.

AB  - Significant portions of this chapter appeared in Page, T., & Norwood, R. (2007). Attachment theory and the social work curriculum. Advances in Social Work, 8(1), 30-48. This chapter discusses attachment theory, attachment behavior, reactive attachment disorder, and attachment scholarship's current status and relevance in the social work profession, including a case example. In attachment theory, the British psychiatrist John Bowlby replaced the Freudian notion of instinct as psychosexual drive, and the hydraulic model's relative emphasis on internally derived motivation, with a model conceptualizing instinct as an interaction of organism and environment. Taking language primarily from the field of cybernetics, and adapting this to studies in ethology and human development, Bowlby saw instinctive behavior in terms of 'control systems.' The expression of an intrinsic need is thought of as goal-directed behavior in a relational context. Modification of the behavior occurs through feedback from the environment, especially the quality of response from the relational partner involved, a process he referred to as 'goal-correction.' Bowlby integrated the control systems model with the term 'behavioral system,' which he borrowed from ethology, to explain the basic processes governing instinct-based social behavior in humans. The needs for new knowledge concerning applications of attachment theory to social work practice are numerous and span virtually every practice area. Little is yet known, for example, about how children who have been exposed to extreme adversity in their caregiving environments form healthy attachments later in childhood, so-called second attachments, as in the case of placement in foster homes. Other important practice areas in need of more research include assessments with children, especially adapting representational measures to clinical settings; adult interviewing, using the insights of research, the use of videotape, using technical achievements from the history of observational attachment research; and education for parents and foster parents, applying our developmental knowledge about the significance of attachment to development to problems in parenting.

AB  - Adopters are taking increasingly traumatised children into their families. These children bring with them disorganised attachment patterns that helped them survive early familial maltreatment. Since they were highly adaptive in their formative family environment, children cling to these relational patterns 'as if their lives depended on it'. As part of the Family Futures therapeutic team, the authors have established effective frameworks for collaborative working, based on trauma and developmental-attachment theories, and developed the practitioner role of parent mentor. Taking behaviour as the child's 'first language', mentors help adopters understand and translate youngsters' behavioural and thinking patterns in terms of their traumatic histories. Parents are then encouraged to increase their children's physical, psychological and social sensitivity by using developmentally-appropriate reparenting strategies, acknowledging the psychosocial 'gaps' in children's attachment histories that inhibit healthy neuro-developmental organisation. Gradually the neurobiology and language of trauma can be overwritten by the neurobiology and language of love.

AB  - This study examines the associations between parental book reading and social-emotional outcomes for Head Start children in foster care. Despite no main Head Start impact on parental book reading, subgroup effects were found. Foster parents in Head Start provided more book reading for children with disabilities but less for children with low preacademic scores. Head Start enhanced social-emotional outcomes for children in foster care. The positive impacts of Head Start on children's social-emotional outcomes were greater when parents read books frequently. Head Start should include more foster families and provided parenting skills to enhance social-emotional outcomes for children in foster care.

AB  - Multiple placement changes disrupt continuity in caregiving and undermine well-being in children in child welfare. This study conducted secondary data analysis of a randomized controlled trial to examine whether a relationship-based intervention, Promoting First Relationships© (PFR), reduced risk for a maladaptive cascade from placement instability to less secure attachment to elevated externalizing problems. Participants included caregivers (birth or foster/kin) of toddlers (10–24 months) recently transitioned to their care because of child welfare placement decisions. Although main effects of PFR on security and externalizing problems were not previously observed, this study’s results revealed that PFR attenuated the association between multiple placement changes (baseline) and less security (postintervention) and that the indirect effect of placement instability on greater externalizing problems (6-month follow-up) via less security was evident only in toddlers in the comparison condition. These findings shed light on how a history of multiple caregiver changes may influence toddlers’ risk for poor adjustment in subsequent placements, and the promise of supporting caregivers through a parenting intervention to prevent such risk.

AB  - Suggests that comprehensive assessment of behavior problems in an infant, toddler, or preschool-age child requires thorough evaluation of attachment issues in addition to assessment of child factors such as temperament and developmental status. Therapeutic intervention with parent-child dyads emphasizes changing maladaptive patterns of interaction and insecure models of attachment in child and parent, while foster parents are more readily engaged in a psychoeducational approach to understanding the impact of the child's history on current behavior. Case vignettes are provided for a 3-yr-old boy with delayed language development and severe behavior management problems and for a 4-yr-old girl with a history of severe neglect and abuse who was placed in a foster home. Suggested cues for pediatricians in screening for attachment difficulties are given. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper examines the needs of children and youth in foster care and the roles of foster parents and social workers in meeting these needs. The needs of children and youth in foster care include having deprivation replaced with nurturing, having loss replaced with gains and healthy attachments, having confusion and disorganization replaced with understanding and structure, having developmental delays ameliorated, having physical pain halted, and having emotional pain eased. Critical tasks and responsibilities of foster parents and social workers are identified, including providing child care, assessing cases and planning goals, undertaking clinical interventions, managing cases, and collaborating. The role of training in helping foster parents and social workers understand their tasks and improve their knowledge and skills is discussed in terms of historical perspectives and current issues. Components of effective training programs are identified. These components must address the issues of the role of training in meeting agency goals, the conceptual framework on which agency training is based, the design and delivery of training, and the outcomes of training. Steps that may be helpful in discussing the future direction of training are suggested. 23 references.

AB  - This theme newsletter issue presents seven articles describing toddler behavior and development, services for toddlers, and toddlers with special needs. The first article, "Toddlers: Themes and Variations" (Lois Barclay Murphy and Colleen Small) focuses on variations in toddler development, noting emerging skills, language, and the caregiver role. Nina Wallerstein, in "Observations of an Active Toddler," details the activities of one toddler over a typical 45-minute period. "Attachment and Exploration: The Toddler's Dilemma" (Alicia F. Lieberman), considers the toddler's task of balancing between the need for a secure base and his developmental urge to explore and experiment. Abbey Griffin, in "State Regulations Concerning Toddlers in Child Care," reviews and compares relevant state standards. Opportunities for social development in a mixed-age mixed-ability program are described by Nancy Balaban in "Mainstreamed, Mixed-age Groups of Infants and Toddlers at the Bank Street Family Center." Seven phases in the transition to out-of-home care for toddlers with special needs is discussed by Tess Bennett and others in "The Transition Process for Toddlers with Special Needs and Their Families." An article by Sarah Landy and Ray DeV. Peters titled "Understanding and Treating the Hyperaggressive Toddler" describes cases of toddlers with aggressive conduct problems, considers the regulation of affect in toddlers, identifies components of the growth-promoting environment as well as the "circle of rejection," and proposes a model for treating aggressive toddlers and their parents.

AB  - Foster children are at great risk for poor school outcomes. Given that school readiness is a powerful predictor of later school success, the promotion of school readiness skills in foster children is an opportunity for preventive intervention. Results are presented from a preliminary evaluation of a program designed to improve school readiness in foster children. Twenty-four foster children were randomly assigned to the intervention or comparison conditions. The intervention consisted of therapeutic playgroups (twice weekly for 7 weeks during the summer) focusing on social competence and self-regulation skills. Attendance rates for the playgroups are reported. In addition, group differences on data collected before and after the intervention are reported. Intervention group children exhibited increased social competence and self-regulation. Comparison group children exhibited poorer performance in these domains over time. Results are discussed in terms of how the study has informed a current randomized efficacy trial of a school-readiness intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Despite the popularity of court-appointed special advocate (CASA) intervention, little is known about its effects on permanency outcomes of children in foster care. Given that a foster child's permanency is closely associated with outcomes, such as being at greater risk for developing emotional and behavioral problems, homelessness, criminal activity, and early pregnancies, it is crucial to explore foster-care children's permanency outcomes as a proxy for the effects of CASA intervention. This study aimed to examine to what extent CASA intervention was associated with permanency outcomes of children in foster care. A systematic random sample of 304 children was drawn from all closed case files referred for CASA intervention from 1995 to 2012 in a rural community in Tennessee. Two groups of children who received CASA services (n = 129) and children who did not receive CASA services (n = 175) were compared. The results of a multinomial regression model indicated that CASA intervention was significantly associated with permanency outcomes; children who received CASA intervention were more likely to be adopted or reunified with their relatives rather than reunified with their birth parents. Further studies should investigate overall quality of permanency outcomes of foster children (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study examined the effect of group art therapy on maternal self-image and self-esteem as well as on the quality of interactions between mother and child. The participants were 4 mother (aged 21–44 yrs)–child (aged 6–24 mos) pairs in which the mothers were experiencing depressive symptoms that affected their caregiving capacities. It was hypothesized that group art therapy would improve maternal self-esteem and self-image and, in turn, foster positive mother–child interactions. A mother-and-child drawing, a videotaped play session, and two self-reports were used as pre- and posttreatment assessments. Results showed that mothers reported higher levels of self-esteem and a more positive self-image following treatment. All participants depicted more mature and/or more self-assured mother–child relationships in their mother-and-child drawings following the group. Only half, however, were able to integrate their more optimistic attitudes and self-beliefs into their behavior and interactions with their children by the end of the study.

AB  - A previous article published several years ago (Prinz et al. Prevention Science, 10, 1–12, 2009) described the main results of a place-randomized-design study focused on the prevention of child-maltreatment-related outcomes at a population level through the implementation of a multilevel system of parenting and family support (the Triple P—Positive Parenting Program). The current report, prepared at the encouragement of the journal, provides additional details about procedures, measures, and design-related decisions, presents an additional analysis of the main outcome variables, and poses questions about the study and its implications. We also offer guidance about how the field can move forward to build on this line of research. From the outset, the three designated primary child maltreatment outcomes were county-wide rates for substantiated child maltreatment cases, out-of-home placements, and hospital-treated child maltreatment injuries, derived from independent data sources available through administrative archival records. Baseline equivalence between the two intervention conditions was reaffirmed. The additional analysis, which made use of a 5-year baseline (replacing a 1-year baseline) and ANCOVA, yielded large effect sizes for all three outcomes that converged with those from the original analyses. Overall, the study underscored the potential for community-wide parenting and family support to produce population-level preventive impact on child maltreatment. Issues addressed included (1) the need for replication of population-oriented maltreatment prevention strategies like the one tested in this randomized experiment, (2) the need to demonstrate that a parenting-based population approach to maltreatment prevention can also impact children’s adjustment apart from child abuse, and (3) the role of implementation science for achieving greater population reach and maintenance over time.

AB  - The negative effects of treatment foster care on the natural children in the foster homes in this study was apparent to foster parents and program staff. The program, William Roper Hull Child and Family Services, was losing some foster families due to the negative impact that the natural children in the foster homes were experiencing. A strategy was designed and implemented to decrease the stress and anxiety experienced by natural children in treatment foster homes and to increase knowledge and perceived support. The strategy was implemented over a three week period consisting of two workshops for the natural children and one workshop for the foster parents. Nine youth, aged 9 to 15 participated in the first session of the natural children workshop. Seven attended the second session. The pretest results of the students who dropped out were not included in the final data. The effects of the strategy were measured by a pretest and a post test questionnaire given to each participant in the study. The observed response to the strategy was favorable in spite of the lack of significant statistical results to support the observations. The strategy increased awareness and knowledge of the subject and motivated program staff and foster parents to pay more attention to the natural children's needs. Appendices include sample surveys, questionnaires, workshop agendas and statistical results. Contains 23 references. (Author/SR)

AB  - Background.The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a brief parenting intervention, ‘Parents Make the Difference‘(PMD), on parenting behaviors, quality of parent-child interactions, children's cognitive, emotional, and behavioral wellbeing, and malaria prevention behaviors in rural, post-conflict Liberia.Methods.A sample of 270 caregivers of children ages 3–7 were randomized into an immediate treatment group that received a 10-session parent training intervention or a wait-list control condition (1:1 allocation). Interviewers administered baseline and 1-month post-intervention surveys and conducted child-caregiver observations. Intent-to-treat estimates of the average treatment effects were calculated using ordinary least squares regression. This study was pre-registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01829815).Results.The program led to a 55.5% reduction in caregiver-reported use of harsh punishment practices (p < 0.001). The program also increased the use of positive behavior management strategies and improved caregiver–child interactions. The average caregiver in the treatment group reported a 4.4% increase in positive interactions (p < 0.05), while the average child of a caregiver assigned to the treatment group reported a 17.5% increase (p < 0.01). The program did not have a measurable impact on child wellbeing, cognitive skills, or household adoption of malaria prevention behaviors.Conclusions.PMD is a promising approach for preventing child abuse and promoting positive parent-child relationships in low-resource settings.

AB  - Although there has been a substantial amount of research investigating the outcomes of such childhood risk factors as maltreatment, neglect, and early abandonment and institutionalization, there is a paucity of research on successful interventions for these children. The current study reports on a research-based intervention for maltreated children. Participants were twelve families (one single parent family) and their thirteen children who attended a therapeutic summer camp-The Hope Connection-for adopted children with special socio-emotional needs. Eleven of the children were adopted from orphanages in Eastern Europe and Russia, whereas two were adopted through Child Protective Services. Scoring of Adult Attachment Interviews revealed that only 16% of this sample of parents were secure/autonomous, the remainder being dismissing (42%) or entangled (42%). Further, within the parents' AAI protocols, there were recurrent themes of loss of a sibling (32%), alcoholism in a parent (42%), and renewed mourning (50%). Second, the parents' AAI classifications were not systematically related to the children's measures, but the AAI Communication Strategy scores were consistently related to salivary cortisol levels, the Child Depression Inventory, and attachment-related features of the children's Family Drawings. A third major finding was that significant changes in the children's measures indicated a significant, and positive, treatment effect of The Hope Connection. This finding replicates earlier assessments of this attachment-based intervention for special needs adopted children. The fourth set of findings showed that these diverse measures of children's psychological functioning were also related to each other in predictable ways, findings which contribute to the validity and understanding of these measures. The results are discussed in terms of the role of adult attachment in the change processes of special needs adopted children, as they and their parents participate in an intervention specifically designed for these families.

AB  - Children and youth who have experienced foster care or orphanage-rearing have often experienced complex developmental trauma, demonstrating an interactive set of psychological and behavioral issues. Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI) is a therapeutic model that trains caregivers to provide effective support and treatment for at-risk children. TBRI has been applied in orphanages, courts, residential treatment facilities, group homes, foster and adoptive homes, churches, and schools. It has been used effectively with children and youth of all ages and all risk levels. This article provides the research base for TBRI and examples of how it is applied. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Children who have experienced early adversities are at risk for behavioral problems and trauma symptoms. Using a two-group, pre-post intervention design, the current study evaluated the effectiveness of a parent training utilizing Trust-Based Relational Intervention, a trauma-informed, attachment-based intervention, in reducing behavioral problems and trauma symptoms in at-risk adopted children. Children of parents in the treatment group ( n = 48) demonstrated significant decreases in behavioral problems on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and significant decreases in trauma symptoms on the Trauma Symptoms Checklist for Young Children after intervention. Scores for children in a matched-sample control group did not change. Findings suggest that Trust-Based Relational Intervention is effective at addressing many behavioral problems and trauma symptoms in children with histories of adversities.

AB  - Young children in foster care are at increased risk for problematic language development, making early intervention a critical tool in enhancing these children's foundational language abilities. This study examined the efficacy of an early preventative intervention, Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch‐up for Toddlers (ABC‐T), in improving the receptive vocabulary abilities of toddlers placed in foster care. All the children had been removed from their biological parents' care and placed into foster care. When children were between 24 and 36 months old, foster parents were contacted by research staff and consented to participate. Parents were randomly assigned using a random number generator to receive either ABC‐T (n = 45), which aimed to promote sensitive parenting for children who have experienced early adversity, or a control intervention (n = 43). Foster children's receptive vocabulary skills were assessed post‐intervention using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Third Edition, when children were between 36 and 60 months old. Children whose foster parents received ABC‐T demonstrated more advanced receptive vocabulary abilities than children whose foster parents received the control intervention. The positive effect of ABC‐T on foster children's receptive vocabulary was mediated by increases in foster parents' sensitivity during parent–child interactions. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01261806. Young children in foster care are at increased risk for problematic language development. This study demonstrated that Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch‐up for Toddlers, a parenting‐focused intervention, led to improvements in the receptive vocabulary abilities of toddler‐age children in foster care. The positive effect of the intervention on foster children's receptive vocabulary was mediated by increases in foster parents' sensitivity during parent‐child interactions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Wraparound care coordination for youth with serious emotional and behavioral challenges has been implemented in every state and in many child-serving contexts, but evidence from rigorous effectiveness studies is scarce. We conducted a 20-month longitudinal randomized control trial of a pilot Wraparound program for youth in foster care and involved in the juvenile justice system (n = 24), comparing outcomes with youth receiving community ``treatment as usual{''} (TAU; n = 23). Youth in both groups experienced significantly improved outcomes, including fewer arrests and greater residential stability. Wraparound youth were less likely to be rearrested (odds ratio {[}OR] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval {[}CI] = {[}0.17, 2.04]), and survival analysis found they went longer before doing so than TAU youth. Wraparound youth were also more likely to be educationally on track than TAU youth by the end of the study (OR = 4.09, 95% CI = {[}1.89, 18.72]). Although these findings were nonsignificant at p < .05 due to small sample sizes, effect sizes were medium to large, and no such trends were found for the TAU group. Implications for Wraparound's implementation and effectiveness, as well as the strengths and limitations of conducting a randomized control trial in ``real-world{''} systems, are discussed.

AB  - Youth in foster care have often been exposed to in-home violence and violence exposure is associated with higher mental health concerns. This study used multiple regression mediation analyses with bootstrapping to identify specific current foster caregiver-adolescent relationship factors and their mediating qualities between in-home violence exposure and adolescent internalizing, externalizing, and trauma symptoms. Using a national dataset of adolescents in foster care ( n = 175), the results of this study suggested that an adolescent's perception of feeling emotionally secure in their relationship with their caregiver mediated the relationships between exposure to violence and youth internalizing, externalizing, and trauma symptoms. Additionally, current foster caregiver involvement and structure mediated the associations between exposure to violence and adolescent internalizing and externalizing outcomes, but not trauma symptoms. Further discussion of the results is included. Findings have important implications for mental health interventions aimed towards youth in foster care. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Looked after children represent a vulnerable group in society, many of whom are exposed to maltreatment, particularly in the form of relational trauma, prior to placement with a foster family. Challenging behaviours can place foster placements at risk and looked after children often confront the possibility of placement breakdown. A carer’s capacity to retain a robust understanding of the children in their care as autonomous individuals with needs, feelings and thoughts can be important in enabling them to respond more effectively to the worrying or disruptive behaviour they may encounter. The Reflective Fostering Programme (RFP) is a new group-based programme aiming to support foster carers of children aged 4–11. This innovative development follows calls by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and other organisations to help improve outcomes for children in care by improving resources for their carers. The RFP is rooted in evidence drawn from the field of contemporary attachment and mentalizing research, which indicates that children who have a carer high in reflective functioning tend to have more favourable outcomes in terms of social-emotional well-being. It also draws on the evidence that looking after a child who has impaired capacity to mentalize as a result of early relational trauma affects the carer’s capacity to mentalize and respond sensitively to the child (Ensink, et al., 2015). This article sets out the rationale for the RFP, outlines its key elements and concludes by indicating future service implementation and a planned feasibility study examining this approach.

AB  - Purpose: This study evaluated the video-feedback intervention Basic Trust in families with internationally adoptive children aged 2-12 years. The intervention aims to reduce child attachment insecurity and behavior problems by enhancing mothers' and fathers' sensitivity and mind-mindedness (parents' capacity to hold in mind the mind of their child). Method: Fifty-three adoptive families participated in a pretest, posttest, and 6-month follow-up assessment. Questionnaires on parenting stress, child attachment insecurity, and behavior problems were administered. Parents' sensitivity was assessed from free-play observations at home, and mind-mindedness was measured with a describe-your-child interview. Results: Parents reported less child behavior problems, insecure and disorganized attachment, and parenting stress at posttest and follow-up. Parents' mind-mindedness increased from pre- to post-test but not from pretest to follow-up. Parents' sensitivity showed an improvement at follow-up. Conclusions: Future studies should investigate whether the present study's positive results can be replicated under conditions of strict experimental control.

AB  - Reviews the article, Effects of a foster care parent training intervention on placement changes of children in foster care by J. M. Price, P. Chamberlain, J. Landsverk, et al. (see record [rid]2008-00982-006[/rid]). This study explored the impact of a foster parent training and support intervention called KEEP on placement changes among children residing in foster care. It also examined the relationship between the number of foster care placements and whether placement changes were positive or negative. Participation in the KEEP intervention almost doubled the chances of having a positive exit and although the number of prior placements was predictive of negative exit rates among those in the control group, it was not a significant predictor among participants who received the intervention. The authors indicate that the KEEP intervention mitigated the negative impact of multiple prior placements. They suggest that placement instability is an important risk factor and should be minimized for children in foster care. They also support the implementation of parent training interventions focused on behavior management and helping foster parents increase their knowledge and skills in coping with behavior problems to reduce the likelihood of changes in placement among children in the foster care system.

AB  - This study involved examination of the manual of the Model Approach to Partnerships in Parenting (MAPP), a foster parent training program implemented in Massachusetts as well as other states. This investigation was concerned with whether foster parents are taught the information and skills deemed useful in handling foster children's problematic behavior and in assessing and responding appropriately to children with attachment and developmental problems or disorders resulting from trauma. This study aimed to clarify whether MAPP is grounded in psychological theory or, specifically, attachment theory. Findings and recommendations in relevant literature guided this investigation. Criteria used to evaluate the MAPP curriculum stemmed from literature in the areas of attachment development and behavior; disrupted attachment and attachment problems; assessment of attachment; child development; foster children (and trauma); foster parents; foster care and special foster care; and foster parent training. The content of the MAPP manual was analyzed using qualitative methods, with focus on its theoretical base, structure and organization, methods, goals, and curricula (core content). The results of this investigation seem to support a previous study's (Lee & Holland, 1991) findings suggesting that MAPP lacks sufficient theoretical groundwork and empirical support of its contents and method for a parent training program. This investigation suggests that there might be significant benefits to structuring surrogate parent training programs within the framework of psychological theory, such as the construct of attachment which involves the emotional bond between parent and child, or between two people. The current study may have implications for content necessary in foster parent training programs. Further research is needed to compare the success of foster parent training programs guided by different theories and principles. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - With the divorce rate at about 50%, one million children will experience their parents' divorce each year in the United States. Despite the fact that almost 90% of noncustodial parents are fathers, there is very little professional literature available to help fathers figure cut how to be effective noncustodial parents. This dissertation project consisted of developing, facilitating, and qualitatively evaluating a group intervention for noncustodial fathers. The group was focused on improving noncustodial fathers' relationships with their children in an effort to keep fathers involved in their children's lives and minimize the negative effects of divorce or separation. The group curriculum was created based on concepts from attachment theory. The intervention was designed to be a combination of a process and psychoeducational group, and was also intended to serve as a source of support. An eight week group intervention called The Staying Connected Group for Fathers was implemented at Xanthos, Alameda Family Services. Four noncustodial fathers participated in the project. Results from the pre- and post-group questionnaires, as well as the author's process notes, reveal that the participants clearly found the group to be a helpful, supportive, learning experience. Each of the group members experienced a strong sense of support from attending the group and gained knowledge of behaviors, skills, and/or ways of interacting with their children that promote good quality father-child relationships. Results from this project suggest that attachment theory is an efficient theoretical model from which to base an intervention that is focused on noncustodial fathers and their children. Clinical implications include the need for increased efforts to reach out to noncustodial fathers. Furthermore, crucial areas of intervention identified include addressing the overwhelming experience of helplessness, due to lack of influence over their children's lives and feeling powerless within the legal system, and the issue of gender role expectations, specifically, the effects that male role socialization has on developing an identity as a father who is able to foster a good quality father-child relationship. Additional considerations for future interventions are explored. Further studies that include control groups and longitudinal follow ups are merited to demonstrate effectiveness with more certainty.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increased availability of well-researched parenting programmes but few are designed to address the specific needs of foster carers, including kinship carers, or are able to demonstrate longer-term outcomes. The KEEP training programme (Keeping foster and kinship carers trained and supported) was developed by Dr Patricia Chamberlain in the US state of Oregon and brought over to England in 2009 by the Department for Education (DfE) as part of the drive to improve outcomes for looked after children. KEEP is designed to strengthen foster and kinship carer parenting skills, reduce foster children’s behavioural and emotional difficulties and increase placement stability.Training programmes for carers of children aged from three to 17 are now running in 24 local authorities across the country. The implementation of the KEEP programme in England, supported by the National Implementation Service, includes outcome data on 572 children and young people and their carers that demonstrate significant improvements in child problem behaviour and carer stress, and positive changes in parenting discipline style consistent with findings from the original large randomised controlled trial. In addition, longer-term outcome data for six- and 12-month post-group follow-up for KEEP Standard (for carers of children aged 5–12 years) and KEEP Safe (for carers of adolescents) show that significant improvements in behavioural difficulties, foster carer stress and parenting discipline style are all maintained. Evidence for longer-term improvements in placement stability is currently limited by a lack of comparative data.

AB  - Objectives: This paper examines the effectiveness of the Healthy Families New York (HFNY) home visiting program in promoting parenting competencies and preventing maladaptive parenting behaviors in mothers at risk for child abuse and neglect. Methods: The study used microlevel observational assessments of mother-child interactions in the third wave of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether mothers who received home visiting services were more likely to exhibit positive parenting and less likely to display negative parenting behaviors than those who did not receive these services. Women were randomly assigned during pregnancy or shortly after the birth of the target child to an intervention group that was offered home visiting services or a control group that was given referrals to other services. At Year 3, 522 mother and child pairs were systematically observed while they interacted in semistructured tasks presenting varied parenting challenges. The study also sought to replicate a finding from Year 2, which revealed that program effects on harsh parenting were stronger among young, first-time mothers who were randomly assigned during pregnancy (the High Prevention Opportunity subgroup) than among the other mothers (the Limited Prevention Opportunity subgroup). Results: Results indicate that HFNY was effective in fostering positive parenting, such as maternal responsivity and cognitive engagement. With respect to negative parenting, HFNY mothers in the High Prevention Opportunity subgroup were less likely than their counterparts in the control group to use harsh parenting, while no differences were detected for the Limited Prevention Opportunity subgroup. Conclusion: HFNY was successful in promoting positive parenting among mothers at risk for child abuse and neglect, which may reflect the program's strength-based approach. The replication of the High Prevention Opportunity subgroup as a moderator of program effects on harsh parenting further suggests that HFNY may be more useful for preventing the initiation rather than the recurrence of child abuse and neglect. Practice implications: To optimize service delivery, HFNY should continue to focus on enhancing parent-child interactions, prioritize HFNY services for young, first-time mothers who are offered the program during pregnancy, and investigate effective strategies to reduce negative parenting practices among the Limited Prevention Opportunity subgroup.

AB  - Young children in foster care often experience adversity, such as maltreatment and lack of stability in early caregiving relationships. As a result, these children are at risk for a range of problems, including deficits in executive functioning. The Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up for Toddlers (ABC-T) intervention was designed to help foster parents behave in ways that promote the development of young children's emerging self-regulatory capabilities. Participants included 173 parent–toddler dyads in three groups: foster families that were randomly assigned to receive either the ABC-T intervention (n = 63) or a control intervention (n = 58), as well as low-risk parent–toddler dyads from intact families (n = 52). At a follow-up conducted when children were approximately 48 months old, children's executive functioning abilities were assessed with the attention problems scale of the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) and a graded version of the Dimensional Change Card Sort developed for preschoolers (Beck, Schaefer, Pang, & Carlson, 2011). Results showed that foster children whose parents received the ABC-T intervention and low-risk children never placed in foster care had fewer parent-reported attention problems and demonstrated greater cognitive flexibility during the Dimensional Change Card Sort than foster children whose parents received the control intervention. These results indicate that an attachment-based intervention implemented among toddlers in foster care is effective in enhancing children's executive functioning capabilities.

AB  - In view of the fact that one of the critical predictors for adult mental health problems is childhood disorder, the issue of applying effective intervention in childhood and adolescence becomes crucial. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) offers a promising approach to addressing needs for treatment efficacy, on the condition that social workers adapt basic CBT to the specific needs of children and design the intervention holistically to foster change in children. This chapter suggests a route for applying effective interventions in the day-to-day work of social workers who are primarily involved in direct interventions with children and adolescents and their families. Topics include: main goals of child intervention, the basics of CBT with adults, adaptation of CBT basics to children, a new model for applying CBT with children: skills-directed therapy (SDT), the importance of integrating developmental components in CBT with children (age, gender, and cognitive stage as mediators in child therapy; information processing as a significant component in CBT with children; language skills as crucial components in child therapy; emotional and social components as crucial skills in child therapy; the role of family environment), the SDT model for children (1. cognitive restructuring, 2. problem analysis, 3. attentional focus, 4. self-control practice), and SDT application to children with aggressive behavior.

AB  - Explores several issues pertaining to children with emotional or behavioral problems in foster or residential homes, the characteristics and needs of the children, and the attempts of social agencies and treatment centers to deal with their problems. Several parameters of treatment in residential settings are defined. It is asserted that residential treatment facilities play a significant role in the treatment and disposition of children in out-of-home placements. The importance of the social milieu in influencing the child's behavior in such settings is emphasized, including the impact of direct care staff who are the true treatment agents. Therapeutic approaches need to address such issues as attachment and loss, damaged self-esteem and hopelessness, trauma and abuse, lack of social skills, and the teaching of basic values. Minimal criteria for defining treatment are outlined. It is concluded that there is a need for process and outcome research to determine what is therapeutic in residential treatment settings.

AB  - When we three Theraplay® therapists began working with adopted children with challenging histories, we became faced with what we felt were Theraplay's limitations with this population. Theraplay was highly effective in helping clients to emotionally connect with parents, to learn to trust them, and for the family to learn to have fun together. Once that was accomplished, however, some of these children were still troubled by past experiences. Family relationships were better and life had settled down, but other problems remained. Theraplay could not help these children understand what had happened to them, nor could it adequately heal their pasts that were filled with neglect, rejection, and intense emotional pain. Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP) seemed to offer a way to connect with children in the same highly interpersonal and highly attuned way that Theraplay does, yet it goes deeper to help the child verbally and affectively process past trauma. As Dafna Lender has stated, we have found Theraplay and DDP to be like twins separated at birth, now reunited (Lender, Mroz, and Rubin, 2005), offering us compatible models with which to address more fully the needs of our children and families that would not exist with Theraplay alone.

AB  - The most frequent problems demonstrated by long term foster children were lack of concentration, temper tantrums, stealing and attention-demanding behaviour and these frequently persisted into adolescence. New parents may need help in developing consistent and effective control over such behaviour and support for properly exercised parental authority should be forthcoming from the placing agency. Parents may also need help of a different kind to develop strategies for achieving more sustained attention in their foster children. Effective parenting is more likely to result worn modifying parenting style in accord with the particular needs and characteristics of the child concerned. Advice may be given about strategies for dealing with difficulties, but this needs to be compatible with the new parents style and the likely response of the child.

AB  - Families eligible for the study were those with a child placed from care for adoption between 3 and 18 months previously. All the children were between ages 3 and 7 years 11 months at placement, were not suffering from severe physical or learning disabilities and had not been placed with relatives or their current foster parent. An initial estimation was that 100 adoptive families could be recruited from about 12 English local authority permanent placement units. A screening questionnaire, Strengths & Difficulties Questionnaire, was used to select into the study only those children with serious psycho-social difficulties for whom the intensive intervention could be justified. Two SDQs were to be completed by the social worker with recent knowledge of the child and by the child’s adoptive parents. Screening questionnaires were completed for 178 children, and the parents of 80 were eligible for inclusion by virtue of having at least one child in the family with a high SDQ score; 38 adoptive parents agreed to participate in the trial. We were pleased to report that none of the adoptive placements disrupted while families were involved in the trial. The prediction that the children's psycho-social scores would improve after the parent advice sessions did not hold as little change was evident.

AB  - The aim was to conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate two parenting programmes designed for adopters of children late placed from care. Adoptive parents, with children between 3 and 8 years who were screened to have serious behavioural problems early in the placement, participated in home-based, manualized, parenting programmes delivered by trained and supervised family social workers. The adopters who agreed to join the study were randomly allocated to one of two parenting interventions or to a 'services as usual' group. Baseline, immediate post-intervention and six-month follow-ups were assessed using questionnaires and adopter interviews. No cases were lost to follow-up at any point and satisfaction was high with both parenting interventions. At the six-month follow-up, a significant difference (p<0.007) was found for 'satisfaction with parenting' in favour of the intervention group (Effect Size d=0.7). Negative parenting approaches were reduced in the intervention group. However, no significant differences in child problems were found between the intervention groups and control group, adjusting for baseline scores. Costs analysis showed that a relatively modest investment in post-adoption support would be well spent in improving adopters’ satisfaction with parenting in the intervention group compared to the routine service group.

AB  - This article discusses a method of combined play therapy/family therapy for looked after and late adopted children and their carers, namely Filial Therapy. Recently introduced into the UK, Filial Therapy's well-developed practice base and growing body of research findings in North American are presented here. The rationale for employing the method of non-directive play therapy, on which Filial Therapy is based, with children who have been maltreated is outlined. Case vignettes are used to demonstrate that Filial Therapy is suitable for using with children who have multiple problems, since it is attachment oriented as well as able to help children address their traumatic, abusive memories and emotional defences through play. Filial Therapy also helps carers develop stronger and more adaptive relationships with their children, reducing their stress levels and heightening their care-giving responses. Filial Therapy seems highly viable as a robust, cost-effective, treatment strategy to strengthen new and troubled placements. However, there remain important questions to be addressed via future research in the UK. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Filial therapy is a specific mode of child-centred play therapy. The parent or carer conducts structured weekly therapeutic play sessions with the child. The therapist provides coaching, detailed feedback, and support, but does not engage directly with the child. Filial therapy empowers parents and carers to become the agents of therapeutic change. Because parent and child work through problems together, children's attachments become more secure, and family relationships are enhanced. Filial therapy was developed in the 1960s by Louise and Bernard Guerney as an innovative form of child-centred play therapy for three- to 12-year-olds. It is a flexible mode of therapy with three main models currently in use, two of which are group models. Filial therapy is evidence-based. Empirical research has shown it to be effective for intact families, blended families, adoptive families, those with children in public (local authority) care, single parent families, and those in which grandparents or other relatives are the full-time carers. Research also shows it to be effective with families of different cultures and ethnicities. Filial therapy can help parents or carers help children who have experienced difficulties such as trauma and abuse, or who for other reasons have problems with behaviour, relationships and mental health. Filial therapy provides help over the long term and after the therapist has reduced or ended contact with a family. Once parents have learned the filial skills they can continue with play sessions for months, even years. They also naturally adapt the skills for use in every day life.

AB  - Previous research has shown that a positive marital functioning represents a resource in adoptive families, leading to a decrease in parenting stress, but little is known about the factors mediating such a relationship. This study aimed to explore whether adult attachment avoidance and anxiety mediate the effect of dyadic functioning on parenting stress in 90 internationally adoptive couples (mothers and fathers) who had adopted a child (aged 3–10 years) in the last 36 months. Participants completed self-report measures of dyadic adjustment, adult attachment, and parenting stress. A series of path analyses supported the mediation hypothesis, but differentially for mothers and fathers. Among mothers, there was a direct and negative relationship between dyadic adjustment and parenting stress. In addition, a better dyadic adjustment was related to lower levels of attachment anxiety, which in turn were associated with less parenting stress. Among fathers, increased dyadic adjustment was related to lower levels of attachment avoidance, which in turn were associated with reduced parenting stress. These findings suggest the importance of including both mothers and fathers in adoption research. Adoptive parents could benefit from specific interventions aimed at reducing attachment avoidance and anxiety by supporting parental sense of competence and involvement for mothers and fathers, respectively.

AB  - Recent research in adoption has considered the factors and processes that underlie the adjustment of children and families. However, little research has been conducted on certain types of adoptive families, specifically on families with both adoptive and biological children often designated as mixed families. This subject is addressed by the present study which also analyzes the association between the type of adoptive family and children’s outcomes—prosocial and problem behavior—parenting stress and the relational family environment. It also examines whether children’s gender, age at adoption and the number of children in the home moderate these effects. 102 parents of adoptive children (ACF) 33 parents of both adoptive and biological children (ABCF) and 102 parents of biological children (BCF) participated in the study. Target-children were aged from 6 to 12 years. The Portuguese versions of the SDQ-P, PSI-SF and FES (Interpersonal Relationship dimension) were used. Results showed that the type of adoptive family—ACF and ABCF—significantly explained the variance of children’s behavioral problems and parenting stress. The child’s gender was shown to moderate the relationship between ACF parents and their perception of child’s prosocial behavior. The results give relevant clues as to the importance of distinct outcomes in adoptive families—ACF and ABCF—compared to families with only biological children and should, therefore, be a resource for professionals involved in the adopters’ suitability assessment and adoption intervention.

AB  - Recent research in adoption has considered the factors and processes that underlie the adjustment of children and families. However, little research has been conducted on certain types of adoptive families, specifically on families with both adoptive and biological children often designated as mixed families. This subject is addressed by the present study which also analyzes the association between the type of adoptive family and children’s outcomes—prosocial and problem behavior—parenting stress and the relational family environment. It also examines whether children’s gender, age at adoption and the number of children in the home moderate these effects. 102 parents of adoptive children (ACF) 33 parents of both adoptive and biological children (ABCF) and 102 parents of biological children (BCF) participated in the study. Target-children were aged from 6 to 12 years. The Portuguese versions of the SDQ-P, PSI-SF and FES (Interpersonal Relationship dimension) were used. Results showed that the type of adoptive family—ACF and ABCF—significantly explained the variance of children’s behavioral problems and parenting stress. The child’s gender was shown to moderate the relationship between ACF parents and their perception of child’s prosocial behavior. The results give relevant clues as to the importance of distinct outcomes in adoptive families—ACF and ABCF—compared to families with only biological children and should, therefore, be a resource for professionals involved in the adopters’ suitability assessment and adoption intervention.

AB  - This module is part of a training program for foster parents and foster care workers offered at Colorado State University. The module explores the attachment process and the long-term effects of attachment difficulties in the first years of a child's life. The module's learning objectives address: (1) ways of identifying the basic concepts underlying attachment and bonding; (2) ways of examining attachment disorder through a continuum from securely attached to poorly attached to unattached; and (3) ways of identifying problem behaviors in teenagers who struggle with attachment disorder. The module consists of four lectures, each of which includes reading materials, charts, and activities for individuals or groups. Lecture 1 considers the importance of attaching behaviors, and the dynamics of attachment between caregivers and infants. Lecture 2 discusses levels of attachment. A continuum of attachment from securely attached, through inadequately and insecurely attached, to unattached, is outlined. A range of social, psychological, and behavioral patterns in poorly attached teens is explained in lecture 3. These patterns relate to delayed development of conscience, manipulation, anxiety, problems with authority, aggression, poor peer relationships, and isolation. Lecture 4 suggests ways of parenting the poorly attached adolescent, including nurturing, helping the adolescent grieve the poor attachment process, teaching the adolescent to accept the consequences of actions, and providing psychological services. A form for evaluating the module is appended. (BC)

AB  - Background: Disorders of attachment and social engagement have mainly been studied in children, reared in institutions and foster care. There are few studies amongst home reared children living with biological parents. The aim of this study was to test the clinical significance of inhibited attachment behaviour and disinhibited social engagement behaviour in young home reared children, referred for treatment of emotional and behavioural problems, compared with young children in treatment foster care. Methods: The Disturbances of Attachment Interview, Maltreatment Classification System, the Child Behaviour Checklist and Parenting Stress Index were used in 141 referred home reared children and 59 referred foster children, aged 2.0–7.9 years (M = 4.7, SE = 1.3), 71% boys. Results: Inhibited attachment behaviour was less prevalent in the referred home reared group (9%) than in the foster care group (27%). Disinhibited social engagement behaviour was found in 42% of the home reared group, similar to the foster care group. Inhibited attachment behaviour and disinhibited social engagement behaviour were not associated with child maltreatment. More inhibited attachment behaviour was associated with clinical levels of child internalizing and externalizing behaviour in the home reared group, not in the foster care group. In both groups, more disinhibited social engagement behaviour was associated with clinical levels of externalizing behaviour and with more parenting stress. Conclusions: Even without evident links to maltreatment, results of this study suggest clinical significance of inhibited attachment behaviour and disinhibited social engagement behaviour in young home reared children referred for treatment of emotional and behavioural problems.

AB  - We examined the impact of the implementation of The Triple P-Positive Parenting Program in North Carolina (NC) on reducing child maltreatment, a serious public health problem in the US with lasting harmful effects on children. In 2012 and 2013, 34 of 100 counties in NC implemented Triple P. A panel data set with county-level child welfare data and emergency department (ED) discharge data from 2008 to 2015 for 100 counties in NC was constructed. A quasi-experimental design using difference-in-differences analysis estimated the association between the implementation of Triple P and the rate of (1) investigated child maltreatment reports; (2) entry into foster care; and (3) ED visits concerning for child maltreatment. Implementation of Triple P was associated with in a 4% decrease in the county rate of investigated reports of child maltreatment (RR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.93, 0.99]) and a 7% decrease in the county rate of children in foster care (RR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.88, 0.98]). Each of these findings was robust to one but not both sensitivity tests performed. There was no reduction in county-level rates of ED visits with ICD-9-CM codes concerning for child maltreatment. Implementation of Triple P in NC outside of the parameters of scientific study is associated with small reductions in the rates of child maltreatment reports and foster care placements. Additional research is needed to understand whether such small reductions justify the substantial investment communities are making in Triple P.

AB  - Children in foster care are an especially vulnerable population with multiple levels of emotional, mental, social and behavioral needs. Research indicates that children in foster care have significant developmental, behavioral, and emotional challenges. The results of this Northeast County study indicate that children in foster care settings have a higher rate of mental health diagnosis as compared to children not in foster care, however, these children also consistently receive behavioral health care and psychotropic medication because of their mental health diagnoses. The placement setting for children in foster care does not appear to be affected by a mental health diagnosis. The results of this study provide helpful information about the difficulties (including limited resources) and challenges faced today by both children in foster care and their placement caretakers.

AB  - Discusses international adoption, specifically the adoption of Romanian children, and the role of developmental research in this process. Research on adoption usually involves a 'natural' design, which allows for examination of the effects of interventions which cannot be carried out ethically using true experimental designs. Such studies may address the issues of 'plasticity' and 'critical periods' in development, and examine the importance of specific relationships and types of stimulation during particular periods in early childhood. Research on international adoption also has implications for social policy, by indicating the need for specialized informational and support services before, during, and post-adoption. Adoption and immigration policies may be directly influenced by the results of research on outcomes for international adoptees. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Over its thirty years, functional family therapy (FFT) has evolved from a set of theoretically integrated and clinically based principles to a well-articulated model of clinical intervention firmly rooted in science. Throughout that evolution, FFT has demonstrated and maintained its clinical, theoretical, and scientific integrity. The concept of function has been a central organizing feature of FFT. Unlike other behaviorally or cognitively focused models, the FFT functional approach considers the meaning of multiple domains of experience (cognition, emotion, and behavior) across multiple perspectives (individual, family, contextual) within a relational context. By focusing on function as an organizing principle, FFT has been able to embrace the inherent dialectic tension in family therapy, adopting both an ideographic and nomothetic perspective. As a treatment program, FFT has been applied successfully to a wide range of problem youth and their families in various contexts. As a prevention program, FFT has demonstrated its effectiveness as a way to divert the trajectory of at-risk adolescents away from entering the mental health and justice systems. FFT has emerged from its history as an example of a new generation of mature clinical models because of its systematic attention to theoretical and conceptual development, clinical practice, ongoing research and development, and systematic training, supervision, and implementation.

AB  - Notes that clinical studies of children in international adoption reveal unique patterns of psychological adjustment to permanent family care. Pre-adoption history often includes early object loss, medical and nutritional deprivation, multiple care-giving disruptions, and the lack of primary care-giving relationships. These factors and the age at the time of adoption are risks to positive emotional and cognitive development. Adoptive parents may be unprepared for the resulting developmental problems. Most significantly, parents and children are often at different points in readiness to establish an attachment relationship. The parents are eager to claim their child, but the child is unready to respond because of emotional fragility and lack of previous attachment experiences. Two clinical vignettes (2.5 yrs old and 2 yrs old at time of adoption ) illustrate the importance of a developmental and medical framework in assessing the unique needs of these survivor children, as well as the necessity of an empathic therapeutic holding environment that can sustain the emerging family attachments under stress. The psychological impact of crosscultural adoption and traumatic early beginnings reverberates across time but with empathic parental care and treatment recovery can be significant.

AB  - Review 3 basic issues that are important in the assessment and treatment of preschool-age children: temperament, issues in attachment and separation-individuation, and impulse control. Although these 3 issues are not unique to the preschool-age child, the appear to take on particular importance in this age group, and problems in these areas frequently result in requests for psychiatric consultation. Topics discussed include: classification of temperament (easy, difficult, slow-to-warm-up), goodness of fit, temperament and school functioning, temperament and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, significance of difficult temperament, development of attachment, why infants become attached, separation anxiety, secure and insecure attachment, influences on attachment (maternal and infant characteristics), applications of attachment theory to preschool-age children (foster care), development of impulse control, problem-solving styles, control of emotions, delaying gratification, and the parents' role in children's impulsiveness.

AB  - The opioid epidemic has led to a dramatic increase in the number of infants and toddlers being removed from their homes and placed in foster care. Doing so places these vulnerable young children at high risk for attachment issues, postnatal medical problems, and development delay. Early Childhood Courts have been found to be a very effective intervention in coordinating two-generation services and utilizing an infant mental health approach toward addressing the child, parent, and relationship needs using Child--Parent Psychotherapy. Florida has a statewide approach with 22 judges currently implementing Early Childhood Court which are showing more timely permanency, minimizing return to foster care, and improving child well-being as has been demonstrated in previous evaluations of the Safe Babies Court Teams. Structures and procedures imbedded in Early Childhood Court protocols can ensure CAPTA compliance with tracking and follow up.

AB  - Individual health is generally viewed as an individual issue, but resilience researchers promote a 'whole community' approach understanding links between risk and protective factors at individual, family, school, and community levels to provide resources and foster healthy development, particularly among children. There is also strong empirical support that resilience-focused approaches to improving mental and physical health are effective and have long term benefits extending from childhood into adulthood. Approaches aimed at fostering resilience among youth faced with risks and hardships associated with family maltreatment and foster care placement are critical for their current health. However, family-level resilience interventions aimed at improving family relationships and restoring the family system to a higher level of functioning than when the child was removed are also important for the child's long-term development, mental and physical health, and contributions to the community as an independent and functioning adult. Providing health care to children and youth in foster care is challenging work. Their story is one of childhood toxic stress, a complex child protection system that faces difficulties with stability and continuity and may even add to the trauma experienced by the children it is trying to protect, and an adult health and social prediction that is depressing. But, just as brokenness can transfer across generations, so can wholeness—even repaired wholeness from resilience-focused and family centered foster care interventions. For the children in our care today, the future has not yet been written, and it is the opportunity of health care providers, child welfare systems, and the community at large to intervene, reconnect the broken strands of their lives, and change the ending of their family's story.

AB  - This study investigated the key antecedents of parent-adolescent conflicts. Using ecological and interpersonal competence theories, this thesis proposes that individual functioning of parents and adolescent, and family functioning are the key antecedents of parent-adolescent conflicts. To address several deficiencies of previous studies in parent-adolescent conflicts, this study was based on a well-articulated theory that examined the individual, dyadic, and systemic predictors of conflicts, as well as investigated gender differences by comparing the antecedents of conflicts in the four parent-adolescent dyads. In addition, a large sample of Chinese respondents was recruited and a number of validated instruments were incorporated in the study. The first part of the study was to translate and validate three instruments for measuring interpersonal competence, including the Chinese Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the Chinese Social Problem Solving Inventory and the Chinese Vengeance Scale. The validation study, based on a convenient sample of over 800 subjects, showed that the three instruments have stable factor structures, acceptable to high test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Explorations of differences in scores between males and females and across the levels of study were lamely consistent with overseas results. As a result of this study, three reliable and valid instruments, particularly their short forms, were developed. Based on a cluster sampling strategy, 1462 junior secondary school students from twelve schools participated in the main study. The respondents completed a 167-item questionnaire which measured their interpersonal competence, perceived parental interpersonal competence, family functioning, and socio-demographic profile. While most of the proposed antecedents were found to be related to conflicts, higher parental empathy and social problem solving, higher family communication, lower parental control, were predictive of lower parent-adolescent conflicts in multiple regression analyses. A higher discrepancy in interpersonal competence between parents and adolescent was related to a lower level of conflicts. Higher level of father-son conflicts was found in families with economic disadvantage, when compared to families without economic disadvantage. These findings indicated that individual and family functioning, and the discrepancy of parents and adolescent functioning are the key building blocks for constructing a model of parent-adolescent conflicts, and this provides valuable information for further refinement or modification of existing models on parent-adolescent conflicts. The study also provides support for the ecological perspective, as the findings demonstrated that the ecological niches of the parent, child, and family systems, were predictive of parent-adolescent conflicts. Successful fitting of the mediation and moderation causal models reflected that conflicts is shaped by the complex interplay of individual and family functioning, reflecting the mutual dependencies of different units in the family microsystem. The present findings suggest that in family counseling or interventions for parent-adolescent conflicts, social workers need to: (a) engage parents in conflicts management and promote their empathy and social problem solving, (b) assist parents to accept discrepancy in parent and adolescent perception, (c) encourage fathers to attend more to the emotional needs of childrer, (d) promote family communication and emotional expressiveness, (e) adopt gender-sensitive practice in handling conflicts in different parent-adolescent dyads, and (f) attend to the specific needs of families with economic disadvantage.

AB  - This study examined classifications of attachment in 42-month-old Romanian children (N = 169). Institutionalized since birth, children were assessed comprehensively, randomly assigned to care as usual (CAU) or to foster care, and compared to family-reared children. Attachment classifications for children in foster care were markedly different from those in the CAU. Importantly, children placed in foster care before 24 months were more likely to have secure attachments and if placed earlier were less likely to have disorganized or insecure-other attachments. Cognitive status predicted greater likelihood of organized attachment in the CAU and greater likelihood of secure attachment in the foster care and never-institutionalized groups. Foster care is an important intervention to reduce the adverse effects following early deprivation. (Contains 6 tables and 1 figure.)

AB  - In the past decades, an extensive body on early intervention research programs has grown with numerous scientific publications in the English language litterature, while such studies remain rare in France. This study reports the outcome of families whose children were followed in an out-patient treatment centre, the Unité de Soins Spécialisés à Domicile (USSD) in Paris. This institution, created in 1975, was designed to promote healthy parent-infant relationships and prevent difficulties for families exhibiting psycho-emotional and or psychiatric risks. The objectives are to enhance infant and early child development, to support parenting competences and to fight against intergenerational process of maltreatment and child placement. The theoretical references of the multidisciplinary team are the psychoanalysis, the attachment theory and the clinic of interactions. Thirty-height families were selected from the files of the USSD: They all had a child aged before the age of 18 months, born between 1985 and 1990 and were cared for more than one year; the other children received intervention after this age. Assessment of parents and children was made when the families had been out of treatment for at least five years. As it is a preliminary study without a control group, we have choose a psychosocial and comprehensive approach more focused on family issues than individual ones. For each child and family, institutional data were collected and argued with the all the professionals still present in the institution: admission in the institution, parental problems and infant symptoms (with reference to the DSMIV and the Zero-to-Three classification), therapeutic interventions (psychodynamic or interpersonal, parents-children groups, parental or children groups, home visiting...), child's re-educations, relationship with other social or psychiatric teams, orientation after the intervention.Thirty-one situations were re-evaluated. Standardized materials (WISC-R subtests, Rutter A scale for children, Nottingham Health Profile for parents) and semi-structured interviews were used for the assessments. Parental consent and administrative authorizations (for children in foster families or institutions) were obtained and interviews were registered. Two groups of families were studied. Group I included families without specific pathology, they received therapeutic intervention for a mean of 2 1/2 years, most of the mothers were depressed. It was composed of 2 sub-groups : in 8 families, the child's birth with severe perinatal problems had brought about the parental trauma, for 7 families, psycho-emotional problems were blew up again after the child's birth, signs of maltreatment could be detected. Group II included families at high risk for child abuse and neglect with numerous psychosocial stress, most of them were followed by social workers; interventions had lasted for a mean of 6 years. No serious child abuse or neglect was detected and there was a positive evolution for the parents' social and family relationships especially in group I. The family support is more precarious in group II, counterbalanced by social and medical support. Concerning children and adolescents, two third are in the normal school system, the others are in classes for slow learners, one is in a day care hospital. A third have behaviour problems. The impact of early therapeutic intervention is notable among children of the families at high risk who had received such care before the age of one: the all have better social competences with peers, less behaviour problems and school failure than the others. Given these results, we can assume that early therapeutic intervention mediates psycho-social risk in these families. As this study is mostly descriptive, it should be followed by complementary research on larger populations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This research is a randomized clinical trial of specialized training for foster parents. Foster parents provide primary mental health services to foster children who have multiple problems including histories of abuse, neglect, and parental drug abuse. As a result of problematic caregiving histories, foster children often develop patterns of interacting which make it difficult for them to develop trusting relationships with their foster, adoptive, or biological parents. The effects of these interaction patterns can be quite damaging, contributing to children's failure to rely effectively on caregivers, and behavioral and emotional problems. The proposed study assesses the effectiveness of an intervention program developed to help caregivers understand and change the strategies children use for coping with problematic caregiving histories. Foster parents of infants will be randomly assigned to an experimental group, in which caregivers receive specialized training, or to a control group. Caregivers will receive the interventions at the time of placement and replacement, and when children are 12, 18, 24, and 30 months of age. Caregivers receiving the specialized training are expected to be more sensitive to their children's needs, and their relationships with their infants are expected to be more secure and effective compared to caregivers in the control group. Infants in the experimental group are expected to show fewer behavioral, emotional, and social problems than infants in the control group. Specific aims are to: 1) experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of a specialized intervention program for foster infants' caregivers; 2) examine particular characteristics of children and parents that may affect treatment outcomes; and 3) assess naturalistically the effects of timing and frequency of foster care placements, on children's adjustment to subsequent caregivers.

AB  - This study reports on child welfare outcomes of a community based, randomized control trial of Promoting First Relationships® (PFR; Kelly, Sandoval, Zuckerman, & Buehlman, 2008), a 10-week relationship-based home visiting program, on stability of children's placements and permanency status two years after enrollment into the study. Toddlers 10–24months (N =210) with a recent placement disruption were randomized, along with their birth or foster/kin parents, to PFR (n =105) or a comparison condition (n =105). A stable placement had no interruptions or disruptions. A permanent placement was a stable placement ending with a legal discharge to the study caregiver. Logistic regression models predicting the dichotomous stability and permanency variables, controlling for caregiver type, child welfare variables, and caregiver commitment, were conducted. There was no difference by intervention group on stability or permanency, but there was a significant interaction between caregiver type (birth parent vs. foster/kin) and intervention group. More foster/kin caregivers who received the PFR intervention provided stable, uninterrupted care and eventually adopted or became the legal guardians of the toddlers in their care, compared to foster/kin caregivers randomized to the comparison condition.

AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of participation in a relational intervention program on child abuse potential, parenting stress and child behavior in maltreated children and their foster parents. Methods: A convenience sample of participants (N = 53) were randomly assigned to an immediate treatment or a wait-list control condition and completed pre and post test measures. Results: Participant's mean pretest scores were equivalent between groups. Post-intervention, treatment participants had significantly lower scores on total child abuse potential, parenting stress, and child internalizing and externalizing behavior than control subjects. Engagement in treatment was a significant predictor of positive change in reported child behavior. Conclusions: This intervention was effective in decreasing symptoms in respondents who were at high-risk for placement disruption. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This paper reports some of the findings from a study (Farmer et al., 2007), commissioned by an independent foster-care agency (IFA), to examine the support services offered to foster-carers and the young people in their care. In particular, this paper documents the use of a ‘team parenting’ approach within a ‘therapeutic’ fostering environment. Whilst there were some issues regarding the comprehensive assessments and the provision of therapy, foster-carers were positive about the support provided both to themselves and directly to the young people within the team parenting approach. On the other hand, communication and inter-agency working between the IFA and the local authority could be problematic, particularly in relation to funding decisions, which could limit the effectiveness of the team parenting approach.

AB  - In the present study we examined the longitudinal effects of an early attachmentbased intervention on children's social development, personality development, and incidence of behaviour problems at age 7. The behaviourally focused intervention was carried out in families with internationally, transracially adopted children placed before 6 months of age. The intervention was implemented during the child's first year of life in mixed families (i.e. adoptive families with biological children) and in all-adoptive families (i.e. adoptive families without biological children). In the small sample of mixed families (N = 35), we found delayed positive intervention effects at age 7 on ego-resiliency and optimal ego-control in girls, and on internalizing behaviour problems in both boys and girls. In all-adoptive families (N = 112), the intervention had been effective in changing maternal sensitive responsiveness, security of attachment, and infant exploratory competence in early childhood, but enduring intervention effects could not be traced at the child's age of 7.

AB  - This first issue of the journal 'Attachment and Human Development' begins with an evocative report on long-term family foster care. One of the papers presents a compelling model of parenting with five dimensions, largely based on attachment theory. The paper describes the model in detail, with narrative examples, illustrating how it is being used as a guide to support and promote effective foster care for highly vulnerable children in the school-aged and early adolescent years. In another article the authors write about a vulnerable mother who lost custody of her infant to foster care, before undertaking much hard and valuable therapeutic work that permitted her to regain and retain custody of her child. Another paper presents fascinating results concerning the intergenerational transmission of role-reversal in a non-clinical sample of 138 children, mothers, and fathers. The opportunity presented by the last paper is for researchers to classify parental behavior in a way that is likely to cohere with child-parent behavior.

AB  - This chapter outlines the main premises of an attachment- and trauma-informed intervention, Group Attachment-Based Intervention (GABI©), specifically developed to target vulnerable families with infants and toddlers. This chapter describes the twin attachment- and trauma-informed nature of the intervention, how this is expressed in the therapeutic stance taken by GABI-trained therapists, and a summary of the findings from the single-group open-enrollment stage of developing the intervention, through to a description of the ongoing pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing GABI to treatment as usual (a parenting training group). The chapter then details the training and supervision processes underpinning GABI. Notably, the development of GABI was informed and developed through clinical work with vulnerable families in a community clinic rather than in an academic setting. And, so the lessons and premises of GABI have much to do with the actual experiences, histories, and dreams of vulnerable parents aiming to keep custody of their birth to 3-year-old child, often against the background of older children who have been placed in foster care, following termination of parental rights. For many families, GABI offers a second chance at the dream of being a good-enough parent whose child succeeds at school, stays out of prison, and finishes school. The GABI model has a vast range of applications for therapeutic work with parents who are living with pronounced feelings of social isolation and stress impeding the parent–child relationship. We therefore conclude the chapter with comments on the potentially wide applications of the GABI model. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Maltreated children frequently exhibit maladaptive attachment styles and internalizing and externalizing psychological problems. Many available training programs offered to foster caregivers have been scarcely evaluated and appear poorly suited for addressing the mental health needs of foster children. A growing segment of foster caregivers are relatives of the foster child and tend to have less social support, economic resources, and more health-related difficulties than non-relative caregivers. Already established as a best practice in the field of child abuse treatment, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) holds particular promise for foster parent training. One component of PCIT is the child-directed interaction (CDI) in which parents learn to follow the child's lead using play therapy skills and positive attention. This study presents results of a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of the child-directed interaction for improving relative caregiver-child attachment and child behavior in preschool-aged foster children. Eleven relative foster caregiver-child dyads participated in this study and were randomly assigned to an immediate training (IT) or to the 5-week waitlist control (WLC) group. Results revealed that after training, caregivers in the IT group interacted more positively and reported having more positive relationships with their child than the WLC group. Caregivers that received training also reported significantly less externalizing behavior problems than those in the WLC group. No significant differences were found on attachment-related behaviors and child internalizing behaviors for the IT and WLC group. These results provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of CDI training for relative caregivers of preschoolers.

AB  - In this chapter, we set the stage for our discussion of loss and healing in foster care and adoption by first surveying the characteristics and experiences of the children/youth and parents who currently populate the foster care system, as well as features of disruptions and dissolutions in care. We then explore the landscape of average, nontraumatic early development in children. Knowing what there is to lose, and what may have already been lost (or perhaps what was never acquired in the first place), when typical development has not occurred in a child's life will help us be aware of what each individual needs to gain in new attachment relationships with foster or adoptive parents. We describe the impact of relational losses and hurt for children and youth in foster care, and examine how this influences their play. We then describe the evidence-based approach we take to working with youth and families in foster care, discuss research findings from the attachment and psychotherapy literature, and conclude with a description of a case involving play and filial therapy.

AB  - The authors examined pilot data from an attachment-based parenting intervention for substance-abusing mothers of toddlers (ages 12-36 months). The Mothers and Toddlers Program (MTP) is a 20-week individual therapy intervention that aims to help mothers develop more balanced representations of their children and improve their capacity for reflective functioning (i.e., recognition of the intentional nature of children's behavior). The authors hypothesized that improvement in maternal representational balance and maternal capacity for reflective functioning would correspond with improvements in maternal behavior with toddlers (e.g., sensitivity to cues, responsiveness to distress, and social-emotional growth fostering) and reduction in maternal psychiatric distress and substance abuse. Eight mothers who completed MTP showed moderate improvements in representational balance and reflective functioning, and these changes corresponded with significant improvements in maternal behaviors with toddlers. The authors also compared MTP completers and noncompleters on sociodemographic and psychosocial indexes and examined the validity of the intervention's proposed mechanisms of change. Preliminary findings support the importance of attachment mechanisms and indicate that attachment-based interventions may strengthen substance-abusing mothers' capacities to foster their toddlers' socioemotional development.

AB  - This study examined relationships between parenting attitudes and behavior and parent-child interaction in 46 mother-child dyads receiving services from one of two infant development programs. Mothers completed questionnaires assessing parenting stress, sense of parenting competence and behavior, knowledge of infant development, perceived social support, and were videotaped in a parent-child freeplay session. In addition, mothers were interviewed about their reasons for participating in and satisfaction with the intervention services they received. Mothers and children were seen twice approximately four months apart. Mothers selected center- and parent support-based services so that their children could interact with other children and to foster children's development. Mothers selected home-based services for convenience, comfort, and for child safety and health. Mothers chose a combination of services so that the child could receive individualized attention in the home setting, and their children could receive social interaction available in the center setting. Mothers were overwhelmingly satisfied with the services. Positive aspects of the services included children's developmental progress, the information they received and support and understanding obtained from other parents. Mothers' reported greater satisfaction in the parenting role and exhibited more sensitivity toward their children, and children appeared more sensitive, less compulsive compliant, and less difficult with their mothers at the final assessment. Higher levels of parenting stress were correlated with lower reported parenting competence, and less sensitive and more controlling behavior during the parent-child interaction. Perceived social support was negatively correlated with parenting stress. With the exception that older maternal age was associated with less sensitive behavior toward children, and more difficulty in specific aspects of parenting, the findings support previous literature. These findings also suggest that among predominantly middle-income, suburban mother-child dyads participating in infant programs, older maternal age may be associated with greater infant impairment and other factors that may result in more difficulty in the parenting role. Findings supported the importance of early intervention services that address both maternal and child needs, as well as the interrelatedness between parent and child functioning for families with a child diagnosed with a developmental disability.

AB  - The purpose of this quantitative study was to determine the efficacy of naturebased therapies to increase the social functioning of foster care youth. A convenience sample of 10 youth and secondary data were used in this study. At a confidence level of .05, results indicated a significant relationship between the use of combined therapies and the promotion of peer-preferred behavior (p = .07) as well as prosocial behavior/social competence (p = .05). The effects of the remaining two scales (school adjustment and teacher preferred behavior) were not significant. Further research is required to explore the efficacy of the evaluated therapies for the purpose of promoting pro social behavior. Recommendations for future studies include random sampling, use of a control group, an extended evaluation period, and use of an instrument that measures the frequency of prosocial behaviors.

AB  - Older adopted children and their families often express high need for support for attachment and trauma related concerns. Postadoption mental health intervention focused on enhancing the parent-child relationship among adoptive parents and adoptees is essential for fostering placement permanency among these families. This single group pilot study explored the effect of child-parent relationship therapy (CPRT) for adoptive parents of preadolescents who reported attachment related concerns, stress in the parent-child relationship, and child behavior problems. Participants were adoptive parents with adoptees between the ages of 8 to 14 adopted out of foster care. Data was collected at baseline, pretest, midtest, and posttest. Results from nonparametric Friedman test of differences across 4 points of measure indicated that CPRT demonstrated statistically significant improvement for the 3 outcome variables: parental empathy, child behavior, and parent child relationship stress. Specifically, results indicated that prior to receiving CPRT (baseline to pretest), parents demonstrated no change or worsening in functioning across all variables, whereas during the intervention phase findings showed a large treatment effect for parental empathy, a medium effect for parenting stress, and a small effect for child behavior problems. Findings from this pilot study support CPRT as a promising mental health intervention for adoptive parents and preadolescent children. Clinical implications and recommendations for working with adoptive parents of preadolescents are explored within the context of these findings.

AB  - Describes the development and implementation of a 10-wk systematic skills training program for foster parents that emphasizes personal development as a prerequisite for skill development. Results are presented of a pilot program with 14 inner-city, lower socioeconomic status minority foster mothers (mean age 46.6 yrs) and their 14 7–17 yr old foster children. Foster children of mothers trained in the program were compared with those of a no-contact control group before and after training. Outcome measures included the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, the Asocial Index of the Jesness Inventory, the Emotionality-Tension scale of the Child Behavior Characteristics Form, the Helpee Self-Disclosure Scale, and a criterion index of placement stability. Children of training group mothers improved significantly more than control children only on the Emotionality-Tension scale. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Long term research goals involve tailoring treatment to the individual needs of children in foster care. To this end, the specific aims of this proposed research program are to define subgroup distinctions among children who enter the foster care system, develop services appropriate to the specific needs of different subgroups, and assess the effectiveness of the services. Recent advances in neuroscience and developmental psychology will be brought to bear on the assessment of child functioning, with assessments of biobehavioral functioning and of specific behavioral transactions critical to defining subgroups and assessing intervention effects. The proposed program of research attempts to refine our understanding of foster children s specific functioning deficits. Children enter foster care at different ages, and with different caregiving histories; subsequently they have surrogate caregivers who differ in sensitivity. Current research indicates that even for infants, age at placement and sensitivity of the surrogate caregivers matter. Subgroups of children, differentiated roughly by age and caregiver sensitivity, are expected to be identified that have different needs and require different types and dosages of treatment. Services are expected to be most effective if they target the specific functional deficit of a foster parent/child dyad. Therefore, services will be developed and refined that are tailored to the particular needs of these dyads. A pilot project will assess the effectiveness of tailoring services to specifically identified needs of foster infants and their surrogate parents.

AB  - This article examines the impact of emotional maltreatment on the psychosocial functioning of youth placed in out-of-home care as a result of maltreatment. Participants included 243 children participating in a randomized controlled trial of a preventive intervention for preadolescent youth placed in out-of-home care. This study analyzed baseline data collected prerandomization from interviews with children and their out-of-home caregivers and data from child welfare records. Bivariate and regression analyses were used to explore the relationships between emotional maltreatment and interpersonal functioning, self-perception, mental health, and behavioral problems for the total sample and by gender. Findings suggest that subtypes of emotional maltreatment are associated with different outcomes and that males are more negatively impacted by emotional maltreatment than are females.

AB  - Looked after children with a history of maltreatment and abandonment are prone to develop high rates of mental health difficulties. They tend to suffer from multiple impairments, sometimes involving cognitive deficits and extremes of antisocial behaviour. Foster carers' management skills and emotional resources are tested to the limit. A further concern is the contribution of challenging behaviour to the unplanned termination of foster placements. Carers, if they are not to feel deskilled by the increasing numbers of children with special needs placed with them, require a more focused preparatory and follow-up training than they usually receive. This study questioned whether a broadly based cognitive behavioural programme could, by increasing carers' behaviour management skills and self-assurance, reduce the challenging behaviour of looked after children and the resultant instability of placements. The answers were sought from a randomised controlled study of foster carers attending the parent training Child Wise Programme (CWP) designed by the authors. The programme combines course leaders' professional experience of working with challenging children and parent groups, and foster carers' personal expertise based on living with and caring for challenging children. The intervention, with an experimental group of 67 foster carers and a comparative waiting-list control group of 50 carers, succeeded in meeting just over half of its key aims. An increase in the confidence of the carers was a significant gain. Also positive was the majority of personal reports indicating improvements in looked after children's behaviour, changes generally attributed to the acquisition of new behaviour management skills. Although some of the statistical comparisons were disappointing in their failure to reach significant levels (eg the reduction in placement breakdowns), they provided useful information about ways of improving the training. Qualitative methods were used to explore the subjective responses of participants to the Webster-Stratton and Herbert (1994) collaborative style of training employed. These produced valuable insights into the personal and professional dilemmas of a foster carer's role, as well as data which contributed to the evaluation of the training programme.

AB  - Large numbers of North American and Western European families are adopting children with serious socio-emotional needs. Other children experience similar deficits as a result of neglect and abuse by carers. Often these children are diagnosed with psychopathology and receive drug treatments that can be ineffective and even detrimental. The authors report on The Hope Connection, a project designed to meet the needs of these at-risk children and their families. Its core is a theoretically integrated summer day camp offering activities that are attachment rich, sensory rich and behaviourally structured. Pre-test and post-test data indicate that summer camp had a significant impact on the children's behaviour (n = 19), as indicated by parent-report measures of child behaviour problems and attachment. These findings are discussed with regard to possible future directions of programmeme implementation and evaluation.

AB  - Joan Moore describes an innovative drama therapeutic approach to facilitating attachment between adoptive parents and their children who suffered abuse and neglect in their family of origin. Children of hostile parents often display fear of adults' proximity. Play is proposed as the most natural way to increase empathy between these children and adoptive parents. Their joint engagement in 'make-believe' invites discovery of new perspectives and heightened self-awareness. The child's life story is explored, initially using metaphor as fictional contexts provide the privacy of distance that allow us to confront what may otherwise be too disturbing or painful. It is argued that working in the child's home, using sensory materials, assists transfer of learning from the therapeutic play space to daily life. Children begin to reassess their survival of adversity as 'heroes' rather than 'victims'. Released from blame for events over which they had little control, children explore continuing troublesome patterns and, through theatrical enactment, create new ways of being. Parents' direct involvement in performance of the child's story (both fictional and real) leads to improved mutuality. The shared emotional experience brings parent and child closer, and parents gain improved confidence to support their children.

AB  - The goal of the project presented in the practicum was to help parents develop competencies in interacting with their children in ways which foster self esteem and cooperative behavior. The objectives of the practicum included, first, increasing parents' knowledge of: (1) the factors leading to high self esteem and cooperative behavior; (2) the role of play in facilitating enjoyable interactions; and (3) the enhancement of children's social development. The second objective of the practicum was changing the attitudes of parents/caregivers by: (1) making them feel more competent at fostering high self esteem and positive behavior in children; (2) helping them become effective play partners; and (3) increasing their knowledge of the foundations of prosocial behavior. A ten-week program was developed and put into action in a rural community. A combination of information sharing strategies were implemented with fifteen women participants. The results showed an increased rating in almost every category, and anecdotal accounts from many of the participants about how they put their increased knowledge and changed attitudes into action. The appendices include a sample of the survey for professionals form, the pre-post test survey for participants, the participant evaluation of project, and the feedback form for participants.

AB  - Objective: Research suggests that the presence of natural mentors may ameliorate the risk associated with emancipating from foster care, though only half of foster youth have natural mentors. This study investigated the extent to which involvement in prosocial activities is associated with natural mentoring among youth at risk of emancipation. Method: Using data from the Multi-Site Evaluation of Foster Youth Programs, we applied multinomial logistic regression to test the association between involvement in prosocial activities and natural mentoring among 720 foster youths, ages 14–17, who were at risk of emancipation. Results: Controlling for demographic and child-welfare characteristics, foster-youth participation in hobbies/activities decreased the likelihood of having no natural mentors and no supportive adults by 57%, having only formal mentors by 60%, and having only foster parents by 49%. Participation in organizations/clubs decreased the likelihood of having no natural mentors and no supportive adults by 42%, and having only foster parents by 42%. Participation in religious services decreased the likelihood of having no natural mentors and no supportive adults by 43%, and having only foster parents by 37%. Conclusion: This study contributes to our understanding of modifiable environmental factors that policymakers and practitioners may promote to facilitate natural mentoring relationships among foster youth at risk of emancipation.

AB  - Intervention to improve educational attainment for children in out-of-home care is increasingly being recognized as important for their well-being and future opportunities. This paper reports on a mixed method study of the school engagement or connectedness of young people in care. The study comprised a survey of 202 young people in care in Queensland, Australia, and a matched comparison group of young people not in care, plus interviews with a subset of 65 young people in care who were surveyed. Both the school environment and the perceived levels of support influenced school engagement, with those who were assisted by carers and caseworkers more likely to be positively connected with school. These young people perceived education as a pathway to achieving work and life goals. The findings suggest that active and focused attention on young people's school engagement should be part of case planning and monitoring as it offers an additional strategy for improving their educational experience.

AB  - Theoretical literature on adoption discusses what are known as the 'core issues in adoption.' The original core issues have been modified specifically for the adoptive family system and include 1) loss and grief, 2) entitlement, 3) claiming, 4) unmatched expectations, 5) family integration, 6) bonding and attachment, 7) identity, and 8) mastery and control. Using a self-report survey, this descriptive research assessed the degree to which adoptive mothers (N = 104) reported experiencing these core issues individually, and in their marriages. Results indicated that all of the core issues were experienced, but in varying degrees. Although challenging, some participants reported that their marriage was strengthened as a result of having encountered these issues. Qualitative data illuminated what was difficult and supported the need for skill-building marital interventions for adoptive parents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The development of insecure attachment relationships in the offspring of mothers with major depressive disorder (MDD) may initiate a negative trajectory leading to future psychopathology. Therefore, the provision of theoretically guided interventions designed to promote secure attachment is of paramount importance. Mothers who had experienced MDD since their child's birth were recruited (n = 130) and randomized to toddler-parent psychotherapy (DI) or to a control group (DC). Nondepressed mothers with no current or history of major mental disorder and their toddlers also were recruited for a nondepressed comparison group (NC; n = 68). Children averaged 20.34 months of age at the initial assessment. Higher rates of insecure attachment were present in both the DI and the DC groups at baseline, relative to the NC group. At postintervention, at age 36 months, insecure attachment continued to predominate in the DC group. In contrast, the rate of secure attachment had increased substantially in the DI group and was higher than that for the DC and the NC groups. These results demonstrate the efficacy of toddler-parent psychotherapy in fostering secure attachment relationships in young children of depressed mothers.

AB  - This study evaluated the efficacy of two foster parent training curricula focused upon sexually abused foster children by examining the specific contribution of a behaviorally oriented parent training upon parental sexual abuse knowledge, comfort with child sexual behaviors, child and parent attitudes, and parental sense of competence in comparison to a more reflective, developmentally based knowledge intervention. One hundred and ten (110) foster mothers (M age = 45 years) from six counties in New York State were assigned to one of two training conditions (Parent-Focused versus Child-Focused) and received five sessions of training. These mothers were caring for a total of 290 children (172 foster, 64 adopted, 47 biological). Ninety (90) of the foster children had been documented to be sexually abused, while an additional 27 foster children were suspected to have been sexually abused. The study also examined child self-reports of perceptions of maternal acceptance for the children between the ages of 4-7 years living in the foster homes (N = 60). There was no indication that the behavioral approach to foster parent education was superior to a reflective approach as parents in both training conditions demonstrated improved scores in knowledge and comfort with sexual development and behaviors often associated with sexual abuse, parenting attitudes, and sense of competence at posttest. No significant differences emerged in analyses comparing sexually abused foster children's perceptions of maternal acceptance to other young children living in the foster homes. However, results do suggest a relationship between a child's sexual abuse history and its impact upon foster parenting attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - By stepping into a child's life and providing nurturance and supervision, foster parents serve an important role in our society. More and more, children who are placed within this system have been abused, exposed to drugs, and endured traumas, and, therefore, are dealing with psychological disorders that increase problematic behaviors (Dorsey et al., 2008). The individuals who provide care for children or adolescents who present with more severe behavioral problems, mental health diagnoses, or more demanding needs are considered therapeutic foster parents (TFP). Despite the increased need for trainings specific to these more advanced needs, current trainings used nationally do not sufficiently address salient topics. In response to the lack of advanced trainings for TFP, the researcher developed an advanced training curriculum—SMARTIE. This study is a quasi-experimental, time-series design that evaluates the effects of this training on TFP in southeastern Virginia. It was hypothesized that there would be a decrease in reported stress and an increase in skill level as a result of participating in the advanced training. Skill level was conceptualized in this study as a combination of parents' feelings of competence and level of disruptive behaviors reported. It was also hypothesized that spiritual well-being would be negatively correlated with reported stress levels. Forty parents of children/adolescents from two local offices completed the assessments and attended training sessions. Parenting Stress Index (PSI), Stress Index for Parents of Adolescents (SIPA), Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (PSOC), and Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating Scale (DBDRS) were completed as a pre- and posttest measure of any significant changes. Participants also completed the Spiritual Well-Being Scale at the first data collection. Results showed that there was a statistically significant decrease in reported stress levels. There was no difference in number of disruptive behaviors or the parents' feelings of competency. The results also indicated there was a significant negative relationship between spiritual well-being and stress. Additionally, the results indicated a significant positive relationship between various domains of stress. Implications for the child welfare field, limitations, and directions for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Background The provision of training for foster carers is now seen as an important factor contributing to the successful outcome of foster care placements. It is believed to be associated with enhancing caring attitudes and skills, reducing behaviour problems in foster children, improving relationships between foster carers and child welfare agencies, and decreasing foster carer attrition. Since the late 1960s, foster carer training programs have proliferated, and few of the many published and unpublished training curricula have been systematically assessed and evaluated. The advent of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and the research evidence demonstrating its effectiveness as a psychotherapeutic treatment of choice, has prompted many working in the social care field to devise CBT-based training programmes. CBT approaches to foster care training derive from a `skill-based' training format that also seeks to identify and correct problematic thinking patterns that are associated with dysfunctional behaviour by changing and/or challenging maladaptive thoughts and beliefs. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural training interventions in improving a) looked-after children's behavioural/relationship problems, b) foster carers' psychological well-being and functioning, c) foster family functioning, d) foster agency outcomes. Search strategy We searched databases including: CENTRAL (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2004), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2004), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2004), PsycINFO (January 1872 to April 2004), ASSIA (January 1987 to April 2004), LILACS (up to April 2004), ERIC (January 1965 to April 2004), Sociological Abstracts (January 1963 to April 2004), and the National Research Register 2004 (Issue 1). We contacted experts in the field concerning current research. Selection criteria All studies in which participants were foster parents/carers, and who were allocated by random or quasi-random methods to a CBTbased training intervention (in a group and/or one-to-one settings) versus a no-treatment or wait-list control, were selected. Data collection and analysis Results from the five eligible trials (total n = 443) are reported narratively. Due to the diversity of measures employed, no meta-analysis was performed. Main results Training interventions evaluated to date appear to have very little effect on outcomes relating to looked-after children, assessed in relation to psychological functioning, extent of behavioural problems and interpersonal functioning. Results relating to foster carer(s) outcomes indicate some improvements in measures of behavioural management skills, attitudes and psychological functioning. Analysis pertaining to fostering agency outcomes did not show any significant results. Authors' conclusions Inconclusive evidence exists about the efficacy of CBT-based training intervention for foster carers. The need for further research in this area is highlighted.

Training interventions evaluated to date appear to have very little effect on outcomes relating to looked-after children, assessed in relation to psychological functioning, extent of behavioural problems and interpersonal functioning. Results relating to foster carer(s) outcomes also show no evidence of effectiveness in measures of behavioural management skills, attitudes and psychological functioning.

AB  - Foster mothers and biological mothers were interviewed regarding their understanding of children's insecure attachment strategies and their knowledge of foster care issues. In addition, parent sensitivity was assessed and case workers in the foster care system reported on foster mothers' effectiveness. As expected, foster mothers reported significantly more attachment-related difficulties with their foster children than biological mothers reported with their natural children. Foster mothers were not significantly different from biological mothers in their understanding of attachment strategies, knowledge about foster care issues, or sensitivity. Case workers' reports of foster parent effectiveness were significantly related to foster parents' knowledge about foster care issues but were not significantly related to parents understanding of attachment strategies. We discuss the importance of sensitivity to attachment issues among foster parents.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study is to examine the correlates of child behavior change over time in a replication of the KEEP intervention. Method: The study sample was drawn from the treatment group of the Maryland replication of KEEP (n=65). Change over time was analyzed using multilevel linear mixed modeling. Results: Parents' use of positive reinforcement relative to discipline was associated with the rate of child behavior change among program participants; parents with the lowest initial levels of reinforcement reported the greatest decrease in child problem behaviors. Other participant characteristics were not associated with child behavior change during the study period. Conclusions: The results indicate the efficacy of an evidence-based foster parent training program for reducing child problem behaviors and underscore the utility of teaching parents to use more positive responses relative to discipline as a robust path to improved child outcomes.

AB  - The relationship between foster children and their foster carers comes with many risks and may be very stressful both for parents and children. We developed an intervention (foster family intervention [FFI]) to tackle these risks. The intervention focuses on foster children below the age of 5 years. The objective was to investigate the effects of FFI on the interactions between foster parents and foster children. A randomized control trial was carried out with a sample of 123 preschool aged children (mean age 18.8 months; 51% boys) and their foster carers. A pretest was carried out 6 to 8 weeks after placement and a posttest one half year later. Interactions were videotaped and coded using the Emotional Availability Scales (EAS). Foster carers were asked to fill in the Dutch version of the Parenting Stress Index. Morning and evening samples of children's salivary cortisol were taken. In the posttest, significantly positive effects were found on the following EAS subscales: Sensitivity, Structuring, Nonintrusiveness, and Responsiveness. We found no significant differences on stress levels of foster carers and children (Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index domains and salivary cortisol). This study shows that the FFI has a significant positive effect on parenting skills as measured with EAS and on Responsiveness of the foster child. Findings are discussed in terms of impact and significance relating to methodology and design of the study and to clinical relevance. (PsycINFO Database Record [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: Behavioral parent training has been proven effective through years of research with a variety of groups. However, little research has been conducted to systematically evaluate the extent to which behavioral parent training may improve parenting skills of foster and other caregivers of dependent children. The Behavior Analysis Services Program (BASP) has been charged with providing behavioral parent training to foster parents and other caregivers of dependent children throughout the state of Florida through a variety of services focusing primarily on a group-class-based training curriculum. This article examines the extent to which behavioral parent training was effective in increasing skills of caregivers who were trained in 2001 and 2002. Methods: Study 1 evaluated skills acquisition via a large-scale analysis of precourse and postcourse assessments, as well as observations of in-home parent-child interactions. Study 2 assessed skills acquisition via controlled analyses using repeated measures and multiple baseline designs. Results: Results showed increases in parenting skills in both studies as a function of curriculum training. Discussion: Implications of the results, limitations, and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Foster care faces serious challenges, such as behavioral problems in foster children and parental stress and ineffective parenting behavior in foster parents. The results of a pilot study that evaluated a training program for foster parents based on nonviolent resistance are described. In a pretest-posttest design, data were collected from 25 families. Significant reductions in externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behavior in the foster children and in parenting stress were found. Using a reliable change index, significant improvements in externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behavior were found in, respectively, 72, 44, and 80% of the cases. Most improvements proved to be clinically relevant. Effect sizes ranged from medium to large for problem behavior, and from small to medium for parenting stress.

AB  - Background The aim of this Flemish study (Dutch speaking part of Belgium) is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention based on the social learning theory for foster parents who take care of a foster child (ages 3-12) with externalizing problem behaviour (a borderline or clinical score on the externalizing broad-band or on one of the externalizing problems scales of the Child Behaviour Checklist), with respect to breakdown, foster children's externalizing problems and foster mothers' parenting stress. Methods A randomized controlled trial was used to compare, at baseline, post-intervention and three-month follow-up, an intervention group ( n = 30) with a treatment as usual control group ( n = 33) consisting of foster parents of new placements recruited via a routine screening or on-going placements signed up by their foster care worker. The intervention consists of 10 home sessions. Results The intervention had significant small short-term en large long-term effects on externalizing problems and medium short-term and long-term effects on parenting stress. No significant effects were found on the breakdown rate. Conclusions Giving the evidence for its effects on foster children's externalizing and foster mothers' parenting stress, implementation of this foster parent intervention might increase the effectiveness of foster care.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate a training in non-violent resistance (NVR) for foster parents who take care of a foster child (ages 6-18) with externalizing problem behavior. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was used to compare an intervention group (NVR, n = 31) with a treatment as usual control group (TAU, n = 31). The NVR-intervention consists of ten weekly home sessions. Measures regarding behavioral problems in foster children, parenting stress and parenting practices in foster mothers, and the size of the supportive network were assessed before, after treatment, and at three months follow-up. Results: NVR showed to be an acceptable approach that lead to an increase in experienced support and some promising changes in parenting stress and parenting practices. Conclusion: Implementation of this intervention might increase the effectiveness of foster care. More longitudinal research using a Multitrait-multimethod-approach is however needed.

AB  - Child-parent psychotherapy (CPP) is a psychotherapy modality for traumatized young children based on the principles that (1) relationships are central to young children's health development, and (2) babies and young children organize their responses to threat and danger around their attachment relationships. Typically developing infants learn to soothe themselves by internalizing the patterns of their earliest caregiving. Early caregiving experiences also teach babies what they can expect from others, and how others see and respond to them. Secure early relationships form the foundation for resilience because babies and toddlers use their caregivers as a secure base from which to explore the world, and to take on the mental and emotional challenges it presents. Thus, secure relationships help young children develop their capacities in three critical domains: (1) self-soothing and emotion regulation, (2) forming sustaining relationships, and (3) cognitive development and problem solving. In this chapter we discuss using CPP in cases where children have been removed from their parents' care and placed with relatives. Child-parent psychotherapy has been described fully elsewhere, so here we briefly describe CPP as it was practiced in the randomized trials that established its efficacy, ending with a brief discussion of the evidence that supports it. We next describe some of the traumatic circumstances that result in infants and young children being placed in foster care, discuss some of the strengths and vulnerabilities specific to kinship foster care, and, using clinical vignettes, show how CPP can be adapted best to serve children in these surrogate caregiving relationships.

AB  - Children who have been maltreated, neglected, or exposed to other forms of family or interpersonal violence often present challenges to therapists because of the complex nature of their trauma and the negative impact on their attachment processes. Their trauma reactions and attachment difficulties are so entwined and their presenting problems so complicated that therapists sometimes struggle to know where to begin. At times, children's prognoses are clouded by bad experiences in the dependent care/child protection system, such as frequent placement moves, inadequate treatment, failed adoptions, and even further abuse. Because maltreated children face numerous challenges to their healthy psychosocial development, effective treatment must address the complex needs of the children, foster families, adoptive families, or biological families with whom the children are to be reunified. Filial Therapy (FT) is a systemic intervention that integrates family therapy and play therapy, and offers a unique and far-reaching form of treatment for maltreated and attachment-disrupted children and their caregivers. Not only does FT represent a theoretically integrative form of therapy, but it can also readily be used in conjunction with other forms of play therapy, behavior management, parent consultation, group therapy, social skills programs, or cognitive-behavioral intervention. FT is particularly useful for these children and families because it simultaneously ameliorates trauma and attachment issues in the context of a supportive family environment. Its premises and goals are consistent with the needs of maltreated and neglected children and those who care for them. Furthermore, a growing body of research spanning 45 years has demonstrated the effectiveness of FT with a wide range of problems, including those commonly reported for abused and traumatized children. This contribution briefly covers the difficulties commonly experienced by maltreated children and their families, the implications of the parenting style and emotion socialization literatures for their treatment, and ways in which FT can be implemented to help them. An overview of the integrative nature and methods of FT is followed by a discussion of its unique contributions to abused and neglected children and their families. Its use in combination with other modalities is also outlined, along with a transition model that bridges the gap between foster care and adoption, as well as foster care and reunification, for these children. A case illustration shows a typical application of FT within a foster-to-adopt situation. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Fifty years have passed between the appearance of the first article about Filial Therapy in a professional journal and the writing of this chapter. In that time. Filial Therapy has been shown, clinically and empirically, to be a powerfully effective and adaptable family intervention. This chapter covers the theory, research, procedures, and broad applications of this very beneficial approach to resolving problems and building strong family relationships. Although the word parent is primarily used throughout this chapter. Filial Therapy is intended for use with any caregiver, such as foster parents or relatives assuming the primary parenting role.

AB  - This article describes the development and application of a wrap-around, multidisciplinary, brain-based, developmental and attachment-focussed intervention for children who have experienced significant trauma in the context of their early life. It outlines the presentation of the children and families who are referred to the service and the model of treatment that they receive. In doing so, it identifies the core components underpinning Neuro-Physiological Psychotherapy (NPP) and links the application of the integrative model to research and practice in the field of neuroscience and attachment and to the use of therapeutic approaches that are beneficial to maltreated children and their adoptive parents. It highlights the need for a neuro-sequential approach that impacts all aspects of the child’s life in the effort to redress the impact of developmental trauma with the aim of improving their overall functioning and their ability to develop healthy relationships into the future.

AB  - Since a review of studies concerning the effects of out-of-home care (OOHC) on individual differences in attachment quality for children suggests that the data are irrelevant to issues derived from the ethological-organizational perspective, alternative approaches are illustrated in 2 studies. In Study 1, 10 boys (aged 2 yrs 3 mo to 2 yrs 10 mo) entering a high-quality part-time nursery school program were used to establish the feasibility of a within-Ss, home-observational design (Q-sort descriptions by 2 observers). Findings indicate that the nursery school experience was associated with immediate changes in Ss' behavior at home but that these effects were minor and transient. In Study 2, data were used from a study by the lst author and colleagues (see record [rid]1981-07880-001[/rid]) on the relationship between OOHC and the quality of infant–mother attachment in an economically disadvantaged population. 90 mothers and their 24-mo-old children were studied for effects of mother's early return to work (child placed in OOHC prior to 12 mo of age), late return to work (child placed in OOHC between 12 and 18 mo of age), and no work (child received in-home care through the 1st 18 mo of life). Knowledge of infant–parent attachment histories was used to interpret and explain daycare effects. Findings suggest that the expected sequelae of attachment may by disrupted for OOHC children when such care starts prior to the 1st birthday.

AB  - In this study, I evaluated the efficacy of a parenting program (TAKE-5) provided by a local nonprofit organization to foster parents of sexually abused children. Participants consisted of 30 foster parents, predominately married, Caucasian, females, who cared for children ages 3 to 17. Administered measures included: Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (Eyberg & Pincus, 1999), Parental Emotional Reaction Questionnaire (Cohen & Mannarino, 1996), Parenting Sense of Competence Scale (Johnston & Mash, 1989), and the Parenting Stress Index- Short Form (Abidin, 1995). Measures were administered at three time points: before, after, and follow-up. A randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the intervention, including treatment and wait-list control groups, and was evaluated with a series of mixed design ANOVAs. The level of significance was adjusted to p = .10 in order to control for Type II error and pairwise comparisons were conducted as follow-up tests. Significant timegroup interaction effects were indicated for parent report of child behavior problems, Wilks' Λ; = .84, F(2, 27) = 2.50, p = .10, partial² = .16, parent emotional reactions, Wilks' Λ; = .82, F(2, 27) = 2.97, p = .07, partial² = .18, and parenting self-efficacy, Wilks' Λ; = .82, F(2, 27) = 2.91, p = .07, partial² = .18. Pairwise comparisons indicated a statistically significant increase in parenting self-efficacy and decrease in parental emotional distress for the treatment group over the course of the intervention, these findings remained stable at the follow-up assessment. Although statistical significance was not met for the remaining hypotheses, a change in the expected direction was observed for every outcome measure and supported with small to large effect sizes. Findings imply that participation in the TAKE-5 program results in long lasting positive parenting outcomes that are associated with healthier child functioning. An unexpected finding was that the wait-list control participants indicated increases in reported child behavior problems, parenting stress, and distress to sexual abuse while waiting for treatment, implying that treatment is most beneficial when made readily available. This evaluation provides some of the empirical evidence needed for the TAKE-5 program to be established as evidence based. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The paper describes a clinical research study of therapeutic observation of an infant in foster care. Infants and children under five represent more than half of all children entering care in the UK. The emotional needs of this population tend to be overlooked. This study aimed to find out about the experience of an infant or young child in care, to learn about possible reasons for the under-detection of mental health and emotional difficulties in a group of particularly vulnerable children, and to inform training and support for professionals. Therapeutic observation has been reported to be a cost-effective, home-based component in multidisciplinary treatments for infants and young children with a range of difficulties. The study found that the model was acceptable to foster carers and provided a child-centred perspective to the professional network. Grounded theory analysis of the observational data produced a description of dynamics around the infant in foster care, varying from experiences of emotional connectedness and containment (Matrix) to those of confusion, pressure and fragmentation (Tornado), dissociation (Machine), and drift or provisionality (Limbo). Observational data suggested that when ‘Tornado’, ‘Machine’ and Limbo dominate, organisation is driven by trauma rather than by development. This increases the risk of losing contact with the emotional reality of children’s experiences. Dilemmas are also explored in relation to the transition from foster care to adoption. The study highlights the role of specialist training to support emotionally responsive caregiving for infants and young children in care. Further research is suggested to investigate the application of this model with infants and young children in a range of care contexts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - The Keeping Foster Parents Trained and Supported intervention (KEEP) is one of the few evidence-based programs that has been shown to be effective in reducing behavior problems and failed foster care placements in foster children. During the KEEP intervention's implementation trial, process-oriented participant engagement (evaluating factors such as participant homework completion, openness to ideas, and level of participation in the group process) was identified as an important moderator of intervention outcomes. However, this evaluation of the relation between engagement and child behavior problems was limited to post-intervention behavior change, limiting the ability to determine at what point(s) during the intervention engagement may be most relevant. In light of these limitations, the present study had two aims: 1) evaluate the relation between the contemporaneous trajectories of process-oriented foster caregiver engagement and child behavior problems using data from each of the 15 content-focused weeks of the KEEP intervention and 2) to determine which pre-intervention factors were most associated with foster caregiver engagement at different time points during the intervention. To address these aims, this dissertation used data from the intervention group (n = 164) from a larger study (KEEP Reaching; N = 354) examining the overall effects of the KEEP intervention. Using piecewise growth curve modeling analyses, the first aim of this study identified a significant upward trajectory for process-oriented engagement and a significant downward trajectory for child behavior problems during the eleventh through fifteenth weeks of the KEEP intervention. Statistical limitations inhibited the planned evaluation of the association between these contemporaneous trajectories. As a result, analyses for the second aim were not supported. Supplementary analyses were conducted in order to determine whether there was an overall association between process-oriented engagement and child behavior problems. When aggregated across all 15 weeks of the intervention, higher levels of process-oriented engagement were associated with fewer child behavior problems. Despite being unable to draw conclusions about the relation between the concurrent trajectories of engagement and child behavior problems, this study was able to demonstrate that there is a relation between these constructs and that they may share a parallel process, which supports continued research in this area.

AB  - Specialized Foster Care (SFC) is reviewed as a community-based alternative placement for children who require out-of-home care along with therapy and specialized services-including those children who are emotionally and behaviorally disturbed, developmentally disabled, and medically disabled. It is suggested that SFC allows for synthesis of strengths from residential treatment and family foster care. Details of SFC programming are delineated, as found in the literature. Key assumptions on which SFC is based include the role of SFC parents as paraprofessionals who are carefully selected and trained to provide a therapeutic milieu, agency professionals who direct and monitor treatment, and agency policies that establish comprehensive supports. Additional features that are recommended but that are not universally implemented include involving the child's biological family, maximizing the therapeutic influence of the community, and providing aftercare services. Although SFC attempts to provide effective therapeutic programming in a cost-efficient manner within the optimal environment, little research or evaluation is available to determine its ability to do so.

AB  - Families referred to child welfare for maltreatment and neglect are frequently mandated to attend parenting programmes. Evidence-based parenting programmes (EBPs) are under-utilised or not delivered with fidelity for this population. The Incredible Years (IY) parenting programme is an EPB that has been proven to reduce harsh parenting, increase positive discipline and nurturing parenting, reduce conduct problems and improve children's social competence. There is also promising preliminary evidence that IY is an effective intervention for families involved in child welfare and for foster parents. This article describes how the updated IY parenting basic programme is delivered with fidelity to this population.

AB  - This study explored a potentially important intersection between behavior therapy and attachment theory in the treatment of separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Specifically, in this article, the authors describe an intervention that incorporated attachment theory in the framework of an exposure-based cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for severe separation anxiety experienced by a 9-year-old boy. Assessment measures indicated that treatment gains were evident at the end of 12 sessions and that the child showed continued improvement at a 6-month follow-up session. Overall, it seemed that an attachment perspective was helpful in framing an understanding of SAD for the parent and fostering compliance with the CBT regimen. Utilization of the theory also helped the parent and therapist in determining reinforcers for the child's behavior. More detailed and controlled investigations of the effect and relative effect of the attachment focus during CBT for SAD are warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - As evidenced by the research, children and adolescents in foster care experience high rates of physical, emotional, behavioral, and educational difficulties. Although some efficacious interventions exist, significant gaps exist when examining the array of effective programming available for this special-needs population. The chapter focuses on prevention and intervention efforts for children and adolescents in foster care. Prior to reviewing programs with some evidence of efficacy or effectiveness within this population, we highlight some common challenges to receiving adequate care that partially explain the dearth of evidence-based programs for this population.

AB  - The current study extends research on the impact of the Fostering Healthy Futures program (Taussig & Culhane, 2010), a 9-month mentoring and skills group preventive intervention for maltreated children, by examining whether the effect of Fostering Healthy Futures is moderated by children’s baseline risk exposure (i.e., number of adverse childhood experiences). Participants included 156 racially and ethnically diverse children (ages 9–11, 50.7% female) recently placed in foster care due to maltreatment who were randomized to intervention or control conditions. Baseline and 6-month postintervention measures included a multi-informant index of mental health functioning and youth-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress, dissociation, coping skills, social-acceptance, global self-worth, social support, and quality of life. A previously published, empirically derived risk index was used to assess level of exposure to 6 adverse childhood experiences (i.e., physical abuse, sexual abuse, removal from a single parent household, high level of exposure to community violence, and high numbers of caregiver and school transitions). Significant Intervention × Risk interactions were observed in regression models predicting 6-month postintervention symptoms of posttraumatic stress (β = .38, p < .001) and dissociation (β = .30, p < .01). Among children with low to moderate levels of risk, intervention participants evidenced fewer symptoms, whereas intervention participants with high levels of risk did not differ from the control group. The results of this study suggest that maltreated children exposed to high numbers of adverse childhood experiences may not experience the same reduction in trauma symptoms postintervention relative to children exposed to fewer adversities.

AB  - Abstract: This study describes the implementation of three evidence-based treatments addressing traumatic stress symptoms within a wraparound foster care program in Illinois. Child–Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), and Structured Psychotherapy for Adolescents Responding to Chronic Stress (SPARCS) were implemented with a racially diverse sample of youth ages 3–18 at six agencies. Culturally sensitive adaptations were made to treatment approaches to improve client retention and outcomes. Data analyses revealed no racial differences in retention in the program and no differences in outcomes between minority youth exposed to the intervention and other participants. All three evidence-based treatments were effective in reducing symptoms and improving functioning among minority youth. Implementation issues, including challenges and culturally competent accommodations, are discussed.

AB  - This article regarding the effectiveness of Theraplay for the clinical treatment of adoptive families both outlines a model for integrating family systems theory with Theraplay to create a new approach entitled Whole Family Theraplay (WFT), as well as provides a preliminary report of a pilot study demonstrating the efficacy of that model. WFT integrates Theraplay with family systems approaches (Structural and Experiential Family Therapies) to treat parents and all the siblings within adoptive families. The findings indicate that WFT treatment may lead to statistically significant benefits in regard to family communication, adults’ interpersonal relationships, and children’s overall behavioral functioning.

AB  - For more than two decades, child welfare scholars, practitioners, and advocates involved with the U.S. child welfare system have engaged in coordinated efforts to increase the number of foster youth who find stable, permanent homes through adoption or guardianship, and these efforts have been shaped and guided by federal policies and directives. As a result, the number of children adopted or placed into guardianship out of foster care has increased since the mid-1990s, and the proportion of exits from foster care due to adoption or guardianship has been growing over time as well. Although this increase in permanency for foster youth is generally deemed a success resulting from improvements in child welfare policy and practice, some voices have also raised concerns that perhaps foster youth are being placed in permanent homes too quickly, or without adequate preparation, and thus, a high proportion foster youth may experience poor long-term outcomes and foster care reentry, otherwise known as post-permanency discontinuity. Despite these concerns about the stability of foster care adoptions and guardianships, little is known about how former foster youth fare after legal finalization of permanent placements. Data on youth and families after finalization are difficult to obtain, and few rigorous studies have examined outcomes for this population or evaluated interventions designed to prevent discontinuity. This three-paper dissertation is an effort to address these issues. The first paper is a systematic review of the literature undertaken to summarize the risk and protective factors for discontinuity and outcomes proximal to discontinuity found in previous peer-reviewed studies. Proximal outcomes to discontinuity are short-term outcomes that signal child or family adjustment problems after adoption or guardianship (e.g., child behavior problems, family adjustment, or parental stress), and may also be mediators in the chain of risk between child, family, or service characteristics and discontinuity. For the systematic review, an explicit search strategy is specified in order to conduct a replicable review, including the dates of searches, search engines and databases used, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and search terms. Search terms are derived using keywords from other studies and by searching database thesauruses. Also, the search strategy is checked by examining whether important articles are captured. The second paper describes exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses implemented to develop a scale for caregiver commitment, a proximal measure to discontinuity. The psychometric properties of the caregiver commitment variable are discussed and described, including its internal consistency reliability in the sample. Also, this caregiver commitment variable is included as an outcome variable in a multivariate regression model to investigate the relationship between child behavior problems and caregiver commitment, holding the effects of other potential confounding variables constant. The third study examines the effects of the Illinois Adoption Preservation and Linkages Program (APAL) on child behavior problems and caregiver commitment, two outcomes considered to be proximal to discontinuity. APAL is a post-permanency intervention designed to decrease discontinuity for adolescent youth in legally permanent adoption or guardianship homes. In the study, average treatment effects for APAL are estimated for assignment to treatment, analogous to an intent-to-treat effect, as well as for treatment compliers. Overall, dissertation findings suggest several risk factors for poor post-adoption or guardianship child and family adjustment, including an older child age, child behavior problems, a child history of sexual or physical abuse, inadequate information given to caretakers, and unrealistic expectations of caretakers.

AB  - This study was an exploratory investigation of the adoptive parent training needs relative to the adoption of an older child, specifically in the areas of attachment and behavior management. As adoption laws change, more and more older children are being adopted. It is precisely these adoptions that have such a high risk of disruption and dissolution. Two areas in particular are shown to be positively correlated with adoption disruption and/or dissolution: attachment and behavior management. The data was collected by a survey questionnaire, authored by the researcher. The main body of the survey consists of two parts: attachment and behavior management. Each part consists of three subsections: most commonly occurring experiences between the adoptive parent and the older adoptive child; level of adoptive parent skills/abilities in relation to the older adoptive child, and topics of interest to the older child adoptive parent. Interviews were also conducted to gain a greater depth and subtlety of information. The survey results indicate that although adoptive parents feel confident and able in both attachment and behavior areas, their awareness of attachment issues and skills to deal with problems of attachment are either undeveloped or underdeveloped. A lack of understanding of basic attachment processes and a denial of the child's pre-adoptive experiences as relevant to the attachment process was revealed. Based upon the findings from this research, a model training program should include education about attachment theory, stages of attachment, and concrete strategies for dealing with behaviors related to attachment problems. The data also revealed that experiences related to communication and behavior management were common, especially early in the adoptive process, with those issues seemingly better understood. Here was expressed the respondents greatest areas of interest as it related to receiving information or talking to a professional, and a model training should include those aspects of training that command adopters' interest. Avenues for further research include administration of the survey to different populations for comparative purposes, further qualitative studies, and longitudinal studies to see changes in the data over time.

AB  - This study focuses on an intervention applied to a parent/child attunement process. The intervention has been designed to support and guide first time adoptive parents as they establish a solid and effective relationship with their new child. Recognizing that their course of adjustment is both similar to and different from biological parents, an intervention instrument to fortify and empower the mutual process of the parents and infant getting to know each other was designed. This intervention, the Adoption FANA (Family Administered Neonatal Activities), was adapted from the original FANA (Cardone & Gilkerson, 1989, 1990, 1992). The adaptation was applied to one adoptive family: a case study approach was used to develop in-depth information about how and how well the intervention design works. The data were collected through videotaping interactions between the baby and her parents, as well as through interviews with the parents. The videotaped interactions focused on three themes: (1) The quality of synchrony between the parents and infant: face to face interactions, eye contact, gaze aversion, and parent response to crying; (2) Self-regulation: how often the baby attempts to self regulate by sucking on her hand, touching her feet together, changing states of consciousness or gaze aversion, and do the parents respect the baby's cues? (3) Consolability techniques used by the parents with their infant. A fourth theme, parents' expression of adoption related issues, was another focus during the course of the study. The videotaping and interviewing began when the infant was two weeks old and culminated when she was three months old. The case study family stated that having the opportunity to expound upon their feelings and thoughts about their adoption journey, coupled with the experience of learning about their infant's behaviors and competencies, enhanced their ability to become attuned with their new infant. Research findings confirm that they did become more successfully attuned to their infant.

AB  - The effectiveness of foster parent training has been debated in the literature. One position is that it may be part of the solution to repeated placements in foster care; the other view holds that training foster parents is not warranted due to its limited effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome of training foster parents with the Love-and-Logic parent training course, a highly endorsed intervention. Foster parents assigned to one of three study groups (the seven-week Love-and-Logic course, a group that read the Love-and-Logic parent book, and a control group that received no training) were evaluated before and after the training, as well as a follow-up measure a few months later. Data was collected with the Parent-Child Relationship Inventory, a measure of parenting skills and attitudes, for pre-training, post-training, and follow-up data. This study underscores the need for effective foster parenting to provide the most stable alternative care for youth in the child welfare system.

AB  - The purpose of this preliminary investigation was to examine the effectiveness of attachment therapy for adopted children diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD). Although attachment therapy is widely utilized in the practice community, outcomes of such therapy have not been well documented. In this study a pretest–posttest one-group design was used with a sample of 24 adopted children who received attachment therapy from trained, licensed therapists. Therapy was funded by the Georgia Office of Adoptions under a contract with a non-profit adoptive parent advocacy group which provided training of therapists and direct services to families. RAD was measured with the Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire (RADQ), Third Edition; functional impairment was measured with the Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS). Statistically significant decreases in scores on the RADQ and CAFAS from pretests to posttests indicate improvement for the children who received therapy. In spite of methodological limitations, the current study adds to the limited knowledge about effective treatment for RAD.

AB  - Dyadic developmental psychotherapy (DDP) is an attachment-focused therapy frequently used with adoptive and foster families. While the evidence base for DDP is building, national guidance has called for further trials and qualitative evidence. This study aimed to understand the experience of adoptive parents who have completed DDP therapy. Semi-structured interviews with 12 adoptive parents were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Four superordinate themes were identified: (1) increased understanding, (2) 'It's a different method of parenting generally', (3) the DDP journey and (4) 'It's a shared kind of experience you go through and come out together'. Parents felt they had increased insight into their child's mind and how to better support their child. They felt DDP was a good fit to their unique situations and it appeared to promote acceptance. The DDP journey started with parents feeling uncertainty and questioning the effectiveness of DDP. However, generally parents became committed to the therapy once they saw change and expressed fear and sadness at ending. Parents acknowledged the dyadic nature of DDP, feeling it helped build trust and security and supported co-regulation. Parents also acknowledged the therapist's role in conveying the core DDP principles. Further implications for practice and research are highlighted.

AB  - Many youth aging out of foster care experience material hardship such as poor housing, homelessness, and food insufficiency. This study examined the transition to young adulthood of youth aging out of foster care, focusing on their experience of material hardship. In particular, the study examined perceived and received social support as critical factors that explained varying levels of material hardship among youth aging out of foster care. The study focused on youths' relationships with birth parents and out-of-home caregivers and examined how intimacy and kin relationships of these social ties were associated with perceived and received social support. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and probit regression analyses were conducted, using the data originally collected for evaluating effects of the Life Skills Training program as a part of the Chafee Independent Living Program Evaluation (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.). The dissertation study targeted youths who were in foster care at the age of 17 and left care before the age of 20 and assessed their intimacy with birth parents and out-of-home caregivers, kinship ties with out-of-home caregivers, perceived and received social support, and material hardship. The study found significant correlation between social support and material hardship of youths aging out of foster care. Lower levels of perceived social support while in care and their decline after leaving care significantly raised the likelihood of experiencing material hardship. In addition, intimacy and kinship ties were found to be significant factors influencing support provision. Intimate relationships with out-of-home caregivers were positively related to youths' perception of available social support. However, such relationships did not prevent youths from experiencing a support decline. Kinship ties between youths and out-of-home caregivers are a factor that prevent youths from experiencing a support decline after leaving care. Findings from this study suggest that departure from care can weaken supportive social ties formed within the system and thereby adversely influence economic conditions of youth. Therefore, it is recommended that child welfare policy and practice should make efforts to help youth establish long-lasting ties within the system and support those relationships after leaving care.

AB  - With adoption being viewed as an intervention, it becomes increasingly important to be clear about what outcomes are being sought from the intervention and from whose perspective success is defined. This cross sectional study of public child welfare adoptions examines the definition of adoption outcome from the points of view of both the adoptive parent and the adopted adolescent. Using a secondary analysis of survey responses from 146 adoptive parents and their eldest adopted child, the factors that most contributed to three different conceptualizations of success (adoptive parent satisfaction, adoptive parent perception of the parent-child relationship, and child perception of the parent-child relationship) were identified. The majority of adoptees and their adoptive parents view their adoption relationship very positively, however they define success differently. Other key findings included that although child related factors contributed the largest percentage of the variance in all three definitions, three family process factors (communicative openness, family functioning style and adoptive parent perceived stress) also had an impact on at least one of the definitions. While structural openness did not have an impact on any of the definitions of success, communicative openness in the family was the one factor that significantly impacted all three of the outcomes. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Many studies have established a link between foster care placement instability and child behavioral problems. Evidence-based interventions for behavioral problems, however, are often unavailable to children in foster care given challenges of recruiting behavioral health providers, sustaining funding, and engaging families in intensive interventions. This pilot study, therefore, sought preliminary data on the effectiveness of a novel brief intervention, Child–Adult Relationship Enhancement (CARE), to decrease behavioral problems in children entering foster care. CARE, a trauma-informed 6-hr training, was implemented at two foster care agencies. Nineteen children, aged 3 to 8 years, newly entering foster care whose caregivers were exposed to CARE were compared with 28 historical comparison children from the same foster care agencies. Child behavioral problems were assessed at baseline and follow-up using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Adjusted CBCL change scores revealed greater improvements in externalizing and internalizing behaviors from baseline to follow-up among children in the CARE group compared with the historical comparison group (all ps ≤ .05). The effect was concentrated in younger children. Thus, CARE showed promise in improving parent-reported child behavior problems. The effectiveness of CARE needs to be further evaluated as it is replicated within child welfare systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Children living with foster families in a resource-limited setting such as Ethiopia are at risk of developmental problems. It is not yet clear whether intensive home-based developmental stimulation assisted by play can reduce these problems. The main objective of this study was to examine the effects of play-assisted intervention integrated into basic services on the developmental performance of children living with foster families in extreme poverty. Methods: A randomized single-blind (investigator) controlled trial design was used. The study was conducted in Jimma, South West Ethiopia. Using computer-generated codes, eligible children of 3-59 months in age were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 39) and control (n = 39) groups at a 1:1 ratio. Children in the intervention group received home-based play-assisted stimulation in addition to the basic services provided to children in both groups. The intervention consisted of an hour of play stimulation conducted during a weekly home visit over the course of six months. Personal-social, language, fine and gross motor outcomes were assessed using Denver II-Jimma, and social-emotional outcome was obtained using an adapted Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ: SE). Information about sociodemographic characteristics was collected using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric methods were used to determine nutritional status. The effects of the intervention on the abovementioned outcomes over the study period and group differences in change over time were examined using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Results: Statistically significant intervention effects were found for language (P = 0.0014), personal-social (P = 0.0087) and social-emotional (P < 0.0001) performances. At the midline of the study, language (effect size = 0.34) and social-emotional (effect size = - 0.603) benefits from the play-assisted stimulation had already been observed for the children in the intervention group. For language, the intervention effect depended on the child's sex (P = 0.0100) and for personal-social performance, on family income (P = 0.0300). Conclusions: Intensive home-based play-assisted stimulation reduced the developmental problems of children in foster families in the context of extreme poverty. Longer follow-up may reveal further improvements in the developmental performance of the children.

AB  - Children adopted internationally are often dysregulated biologically and behaviorally due to prior experiences of institutional care or caregiving changes and thus are in need of enhanced parental care. The present study assessed whether parents randomized to receive Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) demonstrated significant improvements in parenting quality when compared to parents receiving a control intervention. Participants were 120 internationally adopted children and their adoptive parents. Sixty-three (52.5%) of the children and 113 (94.2%) of the primary caregivers were female. Children were adopted from several countries and predominantly from China, Russia, South Korea, and Ethiopia. The majority of parents identified themselves as White/non-Hispanic (95.0%). At the start of intervention, parents ranged in age from 26.2 to 51.1 years old (M= 39.7, SD = 6.0), and children ranged in age from 6.8 months to 48.4 months (M = 21.9, SD = 9.0). Sensitivity (i.e., contingent responsiveness to a child’s cues), intrusiveness (i.e., physical and/or verbal behavior that interferes with a child’s autonomy), and positive regard (i.e., positive affect expressed towards a child) were assessed at preintervention, immediately postintervention, and at annual follow-up visits. Parents who received ABC showed better parenting quality at postintervention than parents who received a control intervention, and these effects persisted at a 2-year follow-up. Findings add to the growing evidence that ABC improves parenting abilities, extending findings to adoptive parents and demonstrating that improvements in parenting quality were sustained several years after completion of the intervention.

AB  - Relevance of the problem stated in the article, conditioned by the fact that the successful adaptation of orphans in a foster family requires specialized knowledge and skills, as well as the need of professional support. Therefore, this article aims at substantiation of the effectiveness of the developed pilot program psycho-pedagogical support of adaptation of orphans in a foster family. The leading method of this problem’s study is the experimental method aimed to identify the problems of the adopted children and to test the program of professional support of their adaptation. The authors present the program of the orphans’ adaptation support, which includes diagnostic, projective, correctional, rehabilitative, recovery and consulting parts. This program is aimed both at providing psychological and educational assistance to adopted children and foster parents, and the achievement of successful adaptation of orphans to new conditions in a foster family.

AB  - Examined the effectiveness of an intervention designed to improve outcomes for infants and toddlers in foster care. Records were reviewed for all children who were adjudicated as in need of care in a specific parish in Louisiana between 1991 and 1998. This period included 4 yrs before and 4 yrs after a comprehensive intervention was implemented. Children adjudicated between 1991 and 1994 were the comparison group, and those adjudicated between 1995 and 1998 were the intervention group. After the intervention, more children were freed for adoption and fewer children were returned to their birth families than before the intervention. There was no difference in length of time in care before and after the intervention. With regard to the same child returning in a subsequent incident of maltreatment, relative risk reduction for the intervention group ranged from 53% to 68%. With regard to the same mother maltreating another child subsequently, relative risk reduction for the intervention group ranged from 63% to 75%. .
